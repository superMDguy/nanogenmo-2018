_NORTHANGER ABBEY  by  Jane Austen-LRB- 1803-RRB-   ADVERTISEMENT BY THE AUTHORESS, TO NORTHANGER ABBEY  THIS little work was finished in the year 1803, and intended for immediate publication._<br/> A celebrated Psychic, Mrs. Piper, uttered, in the year 1899 words which were recorded by Dr. Hodgson at the time.

_It was disposed of to a bookseller, it was even advertised, and why the business proceeded no farther, the author has never been able to learn._<br/>This I concealed where no one has ever discovered it; but my fears would not allow me to go back for the other, as I might perhaps have done, had I foreseen how terribly its presence might tell against my master.

_That any bookseller should think it worth-while to purchase what he did not think it worth-while to publish seems extraordinary._<br/>Still, I could not see what harm could come to me by complying with his request, and certainly I could not have devised any arrangement which would give me such an opportunity of satisfying my curiosity.

_But with this, neither the author nor the public have any other concern than as some observation is necessary upon those parts of the work which thirteen years have made comparatively obsolete._<br/>It was indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not any lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to lay very few of my records before the public.

_The public are entreated to bear in mind that thirteen years have passed since it was finished, many more since it was begun, and that during that period, places, manners, books, and opinions have undergone considerable changes._<br/>These treats were, however, rare events, and made such a mark upon my mind, that when I was sixteen years of age I could have checked off upon my fingers all that I had ever seen.

_CHAPTER 1  No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine._<br/> Everything which the girl said seemed to be meant as an insult to me, and yet I could not imagine how I had ever offended her.

_Her situation in life, the character of her father and mother, her own person and disposition, were all equally against her._<br/>Her whole life was a round of devotion and of love, which was divided between her husband and her only son, Harold.

_Her father was a clergyman, without being neglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his name was Richard-- and he had never been handsome._<br/>`` You must know, Sir Charles, that though my son knew nothing of his parents, we were both alive, and had never lost sight of him.

_He had a considerable independence besides two good livings-- and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters._<br/>Now that they had not only ceased to protect him, but had themselves become a source of trouble to him, he began to understand how great the blessing was which he had enjoyed, and to sigh for the happy days before his girls had come under the influence of his neighbor.

_Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a good constitution._<br/>In her pure and earnest mind her mother's memory was enshrined as that of a saint, and the thought that any one should take her place seemed a terrible desecration.

_She had three sons before Catherine was born; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might expect, she still lived on-- lived to have six children more-- to see them growing up around her, and to enjoy excellent health herself._<br/>He was married to the second daughter of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir Lothian's descendants have their eye upon the property, they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them.

_A family of ten children will be always called a fine family, where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands had little other right to the word, for they were in general very plain, and Catherine, for many years of her life, as plain as any._<br/>`` I have already explained to our young friend here,'' said Challenger-LRB- he has a way of alluding to me as if I were a school child ten years old-RRB-,`` that it is quite impossible that there should be an easy way up anywhere, for the simple reason that if there were the summit would not be isolated, and those conditions would not obtain which have effected so singular an interference with the general laws of survival.

_She had a thin awkward figure, a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and strong features-- so much for her person; and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind._<br/>Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic.

_She was fond of all boy's plays, and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a rose-bush._<br/>  SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION-LSB- 101-RSB-  Masters, I sleep not quiet in my grave, There where they laid me, by the Avon shore, In that some crazy wights have set it forth By arguments most false and fanciful, Analogy and far-drawn inference, That Francis Bacon, Earl of Verulam-LRB- A man whom I remember in old days, A learned judge with sly adhesive palms, To which the suitor's gold was wont to stick-RRB--- That this same Verulam had writ the plays Which were the fancies of my frolic brain.

_Indeed she had no taste for a garden; and if she gathered flowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief-- at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take._<br/>There was no sound in the woods-- not a leaf moved upon the trees, and all was peace around us-- but we should have been warned by our first experience how cunningly and how patiently these creatures can watch and wait until their chance comes.

_Such were her propensities-- her abilities were quite as extraordinary._<br/>Now her spirit seemed very near him, and his own was tempered by its presence.

_She never could learn or understand anything before she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was often inattentive, and occasionally stupid._<br/>I never said anything, and I tried not to make myself ridiculous.

_Her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the`` Beggar's Petition''; and after all, her next sister, Sally, could say it better than she did._<br/>My mother lived for five years after my father's disappearance, although at the time all the doctors said that she could not survive long.

_Not that Catherine was always stupid-- by no means; she learnt the fable of`` The Hare and Many Friends'' as quickly as any girl in England._<br/>`` If it were not for our great ancestors and for our beloved country, the Queen of the Waters,'' said he,`` I could find it in my heart to be glad at this destruction which has come upon this vain and feeble generation.

_Her mother wished her to learn music; and Catherine was sure she should like it, for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet; so, at eight years old she began._<br/>How spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by Miss Julia Ames, who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication, but admitted, after fifteen years, that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over.

_She learnt a year, and could not bear it; and Mrs. Morland, who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste, allowed her to leave off._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_The day which dismissed the music-master was one of the happiest of Catherine's life._<br/>You'll understand that I really do love you when I tell you that, if it were not that I knew you were frightened and unhappy, these last two days in which we have been always together would have been infinitely the happiest of my life.''

_Her taste for drawing was not superior; though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper, she did what she could in that way, by drawing houses and trees, hens and chickens, all very much like one another._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_Writing and accounts she was taught by her father; French by her mother: her proficiency in either was not remarkable, and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_What a strange, unaccountable character!_<br/>What a dreadful atmosphere!''

_-- for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old, she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely ever quarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones, with few interruptions of tyranny; she was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement and cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_Such was Catherine Morland at ten._<br/>`` It was ten o'clock.

_At fifteen, appearances were mending; she began to curl her hair and long for balls; her complexion improved, her features were softened by plumpness and colour, her eyes gained more animation, and her figure more consequence._<br/>Having concluded by a sonorous amen, he at last suffered himself to be led upstairs; while my mother, who had slipped in and listened with much edification to his words, hurried away to prepare him a bumper of green usquebaugh with ten drops of Daffy's Elixir therein, which was her sovereign recipe against the effects of a soaking.

_Her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery, and she grew clean as she grew smart; she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement._<br/>It made me proud as I watched him to think that so magnificent a man, with such easy, masterful ways, should be my own blood relation, and I could see from my mother's eyes as they turned towards him that the same thought was in her mind.

_`` Catherine grows quite a good-looking girl-- she is almost pretty today,'' were words which caught her ears now and then; and how welcome were the sounds!_<br/>You have seen your cousin Sibylle, and though her behaviour this morning is such as to prejudice you against her, yet I can assure you that she is a very amiable girl.

_To look almost pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive._<br/>How spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by Miss Julia Ames, who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication, but admitted, after fifteen years, that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over.

_Mrs. Morland was a very good woman, and wished to see her children everything they ought to be; but her time was so much occupied in lying-in and teaching the little ones, that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves; and it was not very wonderful that Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, should prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about the country at the age of fourteen, to books-- or at least books of information-- for, provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them, provided they were all story and no reflection, she had never any objection to books at all._<br/>She went on to say that the sphere she inhabited was all round the earth; that she knew about the planets; that Mars was inhabited by a race more advanced than us, and that the canals were artificial; there was no bodily pain in her sphere, but there could be mental anxiety; they were governed; they took nourishment; she had been a Catholic and was still a Catholic, but had not fared better than the Protestants; there were Buddhists and Mohammedans in her sphere, but all fared alike; she had never seen Christ and knew no more about Him than on earth, but believed in His influence; spirits prayed and they died in their new sphere before entering another; they had pleasures-- music was among them.

_But from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine; she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives._<br/>`` At the same time,'' said Challenger, his great voice booming strangely amid the silence,`` it is difficult for us to conceive that out of seven millions of people there is only this one old woman who by some peculiarity of constitution or some accident of occupation has managed to survive this catastrophe.''

_From Pope, she learnt to censure those who `` bear about the mockery of woe.''_<br/>` You do me an injustice,' I cried, for the evident and malignant scorn of this girl galled me to the quick.

_From Gray, that `` Many a flower is born to blush unseen,`` And waste its fragrance on the desert air.''_<br/>` Life is indeed life on such a night as this,' quoth he, as we breathed in the fresh country air with the reeks of crops and of kine.

_From Thompson, that-- `` It is a delightful task`` To teach the young idea how to shoot.''_<br/>`` Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that.

_And from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information-- amongst the rest, that-- `` Trifles light as air,`` Are, to the jealous, confirmation strong,`` As proofs of Holy Writ.''_<br/>` As for myself,' said he, with an air of false candour,` you will very well understand that in these days a worthy merchant must do the best he can to get his wares, and if the Emperor, God save him, sees fit in his wisdom to put an end to open trade, one must come to such places as these to get into touch with those who bring across the coffee and the tobacco.

_That `` The poor beetle, which we tread upon,`` In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great`` As when a giant dies.''_<br/>`` I dare say that it has happened with you, sir,'' said my uncle at last,`` that you have lost some dear messmate, in battle or wreck, and that you have put him out of your mind in the routine of your daily life, until suddenly some word or some scene brings him back to your memory, and you find your sorrow as raw as upon the first day of your loss.''

_And that a young woman in love always looks-- `` like Patience on a monument`` Smiling at Grief.''_<br/>`` You dear, sweet angel,'' she cried,`` how can we have the heart to be glad when you-- when you--'' `` But I do n't believe it is so,'' cried the brave Irishwoman.

_So far her improvement was sufficient-- and in many other points she came on exceedingly well; for though she could not write sonnets, she brought herself to read them; and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of her own composition, she could listen to other people's performance with very little fatigue._<br/> I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the case and to lay the narrative before my readers.

_Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil-- she had no notion of drawing-- not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover's profile, that she might be detected in the design._<br/>`` I should be loath to exercise any undue pressure upon my sister Ada; but I have given her to understand that there is no one whom I should prefer for a brother-in-law to my most brilliant scholar, the author of` Some Remarks upon the Bile-Pigments, with special reference to Urobilin.'''

_There she fell miserably short of the true heroic height._<br/>He instantly fell, resigned his breath, And closed his languid eyes in death.''

_At present she did not know her own poverty, for she had no lover to portray._<br/>She could not forget the scrap of conversation which she had heard the night before, nor the secret which her sister had refused to confide to her.

_She had reached the age of seventeen, without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility, without having inspired one real passion, and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient._<br/>She was six years older than Napoleon, and on this occasion, when I saw her first, she was in her forty-second year; but at a little distance or in a discreet light, it was no courtier's flattery to say that she might very well have passed for thirty.

_This was strange indeed!_<br/>This is, indeed, unfortunate!

_But strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out._<br/>Surely that must be obvious, for in what other possible way can the facts be explained?''

_There was not one lord in the neighbourhood; no-- not even a baronet._<br/>There was not one of us who did not carry away a kindly remembrance of the land and its people.

_There was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door-- not one young man whose origin was unknown._<br/>There was not one of them who did not look to me in his trouble, and to the best of my poor power I had befriended and consoled them.

_Her father had no ward, and the squire of the parish no children._<br/>Lord Avon had no children, and Sir Lothian Hume-- the same who was at the card-party-- is his nephew and heir.

_But when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of forty surrounding families can not prevent her._<br/>`` Oh, a lady of mature years may do many things which a young girl must avoid.''

_Something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way._<br/>If it comes to a rally I should hold my own, and I should have the better of him at a throw.''

_Mr. Allen, who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton, the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived, was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution-- and his lady, a good-humoured woman, fond of Miss Morland, and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village, she must seek them abroad, invited her to go with them._<br/>`` My name is Sawyer-- her's is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her-- and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he's at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops--'' `` Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,'' I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion;`` it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.''

_Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance, and Catherine all happiness._<br/>Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of curiosity.

_CHAPTER 2  In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland's personal and mental endowments, when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks' residence in Bath, it may be stated, for the reader's more certain information, lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be, that her heart was affectionate; her disposition cheerful and open, without conceit or affectation of any kind-- her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl; her person pleasing, and, when in good looks, pretty-- and her mind about as ignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is._<br/>`` I have already explained to our young friend here,'' said Challenger-LRB- he has a way of alluding to me as if I were a school child ten years old-RRB-,`` that it is quite impossible that there should be an easy way up anywhere, for the simple reason that if there were the summit would not be isolated, and those conditions would not obtain which have effected so singular an interference with the general laws of survival.

_When the hour of departure drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs. Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe._<br/>` If your Majesty will overlook what I have done,' Lesage stammered,' I shall faithfully promise you that I will be your most loyal servant until the day of my death.'

_A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together; and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm-house, must, at such a moment, relieve the fulness of her heart._<br/> But in spite of the evident hatred of her husband's family, the Empress appeared to be entirely unconcerned and at her ease as she strolled about among the groups of her guests with a kindly glance and a pleasant word for each of them.

_Who would not think so?_<br/>But it would not do!

_But Mrs. Morland knew so little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_Her cautions were confined to the following points._<br/>And so the matter was allowed to rest.

_`` I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat, when you come from the rooms at night; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend; I will give you this little book on purpose.''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Sally, or rather Sarah-LRB- for what young lady of common gentility will reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can?-RRB-_<br/> And she began a scene between the two of them, so exact in voice and manner that it seemed to us as if there were really two folk before us: the stern old mother with her hand up like an ear-trumpet, and her flouncing, bouncing daughter.

_, must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister._<br/>`` I should wish Ida to be my sister, and you my wife.''

_It is remarkable, however, that she neither insisted on Catherine's writing by every post, nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance, nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce._<br/>As she could not speak a word of the language, however, and was unable to make any of the delinquents understand what it was that she wanted, her passage up the Nile left the immemorial East very much as she had found it, but afforded a good deal of sympathetic amusement to her fellow-travellers.

_Everything indeed relative to this important journey was done, on the part of the Morlands, with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life, than with the refined susceptibilities, the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Her father, instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker, or even putting an hundred pounds bank-bill into her hands, gave her only ten guineas, and promised her more when she wanted it._<br/>I give ye my word that only a week gone last Friday I stopped a grazier coming from Blandford fair, and I took seven hundred guineas off him in these paper cheques, as they call them-- enough, had it been in gold, to have lasted me for a three month rouse.

_Under these unpromising auspices, the parting took place, and the journey began._<br/> Under some foolish, aimless impulse, he took a few quick steps towards the door.

_It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety._<br/>They were filled with the quiet serenity of despair.

_Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them, nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero._<br/>Nor could the heroism and the folly be kept apart, for there were few who could quite escape the contagion of the times.

_Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear, on Mrs. Allen's side, of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be groundless._<br/>No one could be more averse from cruelty than I am, but you were present with me some months ago when Toussac silenced the man from Bow Street, and certainly it was done with such dexterity that the process was probably more painful to the spectators than to the victim.

_They arrived at Bath._<br/>`` And then he arrived.

_Catherine was all eager delight-- her eyes were here, there, everywhere, as they approached its fine and striking environs, and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel._<br/>We are happy to state that the fit rapidly passed off, and that, owing to the skilful attention which he received, the gentleman, who is a distinguished visitor in our city, was able to regain his hotel and is now rapidly becoming convalescent.'

_She was come to be happy, and she felt happy already._<br/>I told him that I should be very happy.

_They were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street._<br/> We lunched at Stephen's, the fashionable inn in Bond Street, where I saw a line of tilburys and saddle-horses, which stretched from the door to the further end of the street.

_It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen, that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work, and how she will, probably, contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable-- whether by her imprudence, vulgarity, or jealousy-- whether by intercepting her letters, ruining her character, or turning her out of doors._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Mrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females, whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marry them._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_She had neither beauty, genius, accomplishment, nor manner._<br/>She was of a perfect beauty, but she had not the figure nor the grace of Lucia.

_The air of a gentlewoman, a great deal of quiet, inactive good temper, and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible, intelligent man like Mr. Allen._<br/>The less experienced a doctor is, the higher are his notions of professional dignity, as I need not remind you, my young friend, so I was about to refuse the commission with indignation, when I bethought me that, quite apart from medicine, we were gentleman and lady, and that she had asked me to do something for her which was evidently of the greatest possible importance in her eyes.

_In one respect she was admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public, being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be._<br/>I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing.

_Dress was her passion._<br/>But she-- she was admirable.

_She had a most harmless delight in being fine; and our heroine's entree into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn, and her chaperone was provided with a dress of the newest fashion._<br/>By degrees I had trained my old servant into habits of silence, so that she now rarely opened her lips, though I doubt not that when twice a year she visited her relations in Wick, her tongue during those few days made up for its enforced rest.

_Catherine too made some purchases herself, and when all these matters were arranged, the important evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms._<br/>My energies shall now be devoted to devising some means by which spirits may be able to recollect what occurs to them in their free state, and I trust that when I have worked this out, I may have the pleasure of meeting you all once again in this hall, and demonstrating to you the result.''

_Her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand, her clothes put on with care, and both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do._<br/>But presently, as the designer took them out one by one and placed them on the table, I understood that the Emperor, with his extraordinary passion for detail and for directly controlling everything in his Court, had had these dolls dressed in order to judge the effect of the gorgeous costumes which had been ordered for his grand functionaries upon State occasions.

_With such encouragement, Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured through the crowd._<br/>`` I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them.

_As for admiration, it was always very welcome when it came, but she did not depend on it._<br/>If love had not come to her yet, there was at least pity and sympathy, which are nearly akin to it.

_Mrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom till late._<br/>' I would have told you that the cottage was the rendezvous, but it was not decided upon until the last moment.

_The season was full, the room crowded, and the two ladies squeezed in as well as they could._<br/>It was too late now, however, for Roustem the Mameluke had opened the door, and two ladies had entered the room.

_As for Mr. Allen, he repaired directly to the card-room, and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves._<br/>When the Professor published his experiences in the _ Medicalschrift _ as he had promised, he was met by an intimation, even from his colleagues, that he would do well to have his mind cared for, and that another such publication would certainly consign him to a madhouse.

_With more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protegee, Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by the door, as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow; Catherine, however, kept close at her side, and linked her arm too firmly within her friend's to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd; it seemed rather to increase as they went on, whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door, they should easily find seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience._<br/>And then, whether it was this nerve-racking vision before me, or whether, my task finished, all the overwork of the past weeks came in one crushing weight upon me, the room danced round me, the floor seemed to sink away beneath my feet, and I remembered no more.

_But this was far from being the case, and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room, their situation was just the same; they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies._<br/>That colour alone showed that she could be none other than the Empress; but the dignity of her carriage, the fierce authority of her magnificent dark eyes, and the perfect beauty of her haughty face, all proclaimed that it could only be that of Theodora who, in spite of her lowly origin, was the most majestic as well as the most maturely lovely of all the women in her kingdom.

_Still they moved on-- something better was yet in view; and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench._<br/>I was determined, however, not to look about me before I had reached the very highest point, so I scrambled on until I had got so far that the topmost branch was bending beneath my weight.

_Here there was something less of crowd than below; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the company beneath her, and of all the dangers of her late passage through them._<br/>She was some distance off when I first set eyes upon her, yet I knew that this wandering woman could be none other than our arrival of last night, for there was a grace and refinement in her bearing which marked her from the dwellers of the fells.

_It was a splendid sight, and she began, for the first time that evening, to feel herself at a ball: she longed to dance, but she had not an acquaintance in the room._<br/>She saw her face as the glass reflected it, but she did not see the changing play of expression which gave it its charm-- the infinite pity, the sympathy, the sweet womanliness which drew towards her all who were in doubt and in trouble, even as poor slow-moving Charles Westmacott had been drawn to her that night.

_Mrs. Allen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly, every now and then,`` I wish you could dance, my dear-- I wish you could get a partner.''_<br/>'T is true that if La Jeune were dancing, or if Mrs. Bracegirdle or Mrs. Oldfield came upon the boards, we would hum and clap, but it was the fine woman that we applauded rather than the actress.'

_For some time her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes; but they were repeated so often, and proved so totally ineffectual, that Catherine grew tired at last, and would thank her no more._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_They were not long able, however, to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained._<br/> I was weary and spent, so my progress was not so fast as I wished; but at last I came into regions which I knew.

_Everybody was shortly in motion for tea, and they must squeeze out like the rest._<br/>And now you shall come in with me, and we will take a dish of tea together.''

_Catherine began to feel something of disappointment-- she was tired of being continually pressed against by people, the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest, and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow captives; and when at last arrived in the tea-room, she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join, no acquaintance to claim, no gentleman to assist them._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_They saw nothing of Mr. Allen; and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation, were obliged to sit down at the end of a table, at which a large party were already placed, without having anything to do there, or anybody to speak to, except each other._<br/>He had certainly a strange audience to harangue: his wife perfectly acquiescent and absolutely ignorant of his meaning, Summerlee seated in the shadow, querulous and critical but interested, Lord John lounging in a corner somewhat bored by the whole proceeding, and myself beside the window watching the scene with a kind of detached attention, as if it were all a dream or something in which I had no personal interest whatever.

_Mrs. Allen congratulated herself, as soon as they were seated, on having preserved her gown from injury._<br/> I glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed lodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes's simple deduction had brought to their faces.

_`` It would have been very shocking to have it torn,'' said she,`` would not it?_<br/>He would not resent it so much if he had not something to fear from it.

_It is such a delicate muslin._<br/>`` This is very piquant.

_For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room, I assure you.''_<br/>I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.''

_`` How uncomfortable it is,'' whispered Catherine,`` not to have a single acquaintance here!''_<br/>`` My words were not addressed to you, sir,'' answered Sterne, looking rather frightened.

_`` Yes, my dear,'' replied Mrs. Allen, with perfect serenity,`` it is very uncomfortable indeed.''_<br/>`` But, my dear Mrs. Smith,'' said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders,`` You are frightening yourself about nothing.

_`` What shall we do?_<br/>`` What shall we do?''

_The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here-- we seem forcing ourselves into their party.''_<br/>Yes, gentlemen,' he continued, raising his voice and glancing across the table at some of the courtiers,` ye may sneer at words of piety, but I say that it is you and those like you who will bring down God's anger upon this army.'

_`` Aye, so we do._<br/>`` Ah, so you did.

_That is very disagreeable._<br/>`` It is indeed deplorable.

_I wish we had a large acquaintance here.''_<br/>I wish to goodness she had called me.''

_`` I wish we had any-- it would be somebody to go to.''_<br/>`` I'd have done it to please you.''

_`` Very true, my dear; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly._<br/>`` Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.''

_The Skinners were here last year-- I wish they were here now.''_<br/>`` You were in trouble last month for the same thing.

_`` Had not we better go away as it is?_<br/>`` I could not wish a better one.''

_Here are no tea-things for us, you see.''_<br/>There is no safety for any of us.

_`` No more there are, indeed._<br/>`` No, indeed.''

_How very provoking!_<br/>How absurd!

_But I think we had better sit still, for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd!_<br/>It would have been hard to let them down if it had been wished, so dense was the crowd around them.

_How is my head, my dear?_<br/>Oh, dear, dear, what is this I hear?''

_Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it, I am afraid.''_<br/>I am afraid that I have been somewhat carried away by it.''

_`` No, indeed, it looks very nice._<br/>`` No, it seems fair enough.''

_But, dear Mrs. Allen, are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people?_<br/>But we can never forget your kindness, Charles, in showing our dear Rodney something of the world.''

_I think you must know somebody.''_<br/>I rather think you must.''

_`` I do n't, upon my word-- I wish I did._<br/>`` Then I must confess that I do n't know what it is.''

_I wish I had a large acquaintance here with all my heart, and then I should get you a partner._<br/>I have been able to do so much for him that he has become my very good friend, so that I may ask him what I like in return.

_I should be so glad to have you dance._<br/>I should be so glad if you would.''

_There goes a strange-looking woman!_<br/>There she goes!

_What an odd gown she has got on!_<br/>Then she took it with her left hand and held it against her gown out of his sight.

_How old-fashioned it is!_<br/>That would be very old-fashioned.

_Look at the back.''_<br/>`` Look at this.

_After some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours; it was thankfully accepted, and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it, which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening, till they were discovered and joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_`` Well, Miss Morland,'' said he, directly,`` I hope you have had an agreeable ball.''_<br/>`` Well,'' said Mr. Lumsden, with some hesitation,`` I hope that your temper is really as good as you say, for I rather fancy that you may need it.''

_`` Very agreeable indeed,'' she replied, vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn._<br/>` Your silence is a sufficient answer,' said she, as I hesitated for a reply.'

_`` I wish she had been able to dance,'' said his wife;`` I wish we could have got a partner for her._<br/>`` In fact,'' said the Professor,`` I hope that she will now be induced to aid me in getting a wife.

_I have been saying how glad I should be if the Skinners were here this winter instead of last; or if the Parrys had come, as they talked of once, she might have danced with George Parry._<br/>When I thought of the way in which he had spoken of his unhappy friend, Lord Avon, upon the evening before, and of the emotion which he showed as he told the horrible story, I was glad to think that there was the heart of a man there, however much it might please him to conceal it.

_I am so sorry she has not had a partner!''_<br/>Oh, I trust he is not offended with me!

_`` We shall do better another evening I hope,'' was Mr. Allen's consolation._<br/>`` Then I suppose that we had better call again,'' said the Admiral.

_The company began to disperse when the dancing was over-- enough to leave space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort; and now was the time for a heroine, who had not yet played a very distinguished part in the events of the evening, to be noticed and admired._<br/>` Being a fine night,' said he,` we chose to walk back to our lodgings; but never shall I forget the wicked scenes wherewith we were encountered on the way.

_Every five minutes, by removing some of the crowd, gave greater openings for her charms._<br/>For about ten or twelve years' time she had in her right hand four running wounds, one on the inside, three on the back of her hand, as well as two more in the same arm, one above her hand-wrist, the other above the bending of her arm.

_She was now seen by many young men who had not been near her before._<br/>Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before.

_Not one, however, started with rapturous wonder on beholding her, no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room, nor was she once called a divinity by anybody._<br/>Never shall I forget the sudden flash of hope which shone in his dark eyes when he saw a comrade burst into the room, or the look of despair which followed as he understood that I had come not to change his fate but to share it.

_Yet Catherine was in very good looks, and had the company only seen her three years before, they would now have thought her exceedingly handsome._<br/>But after his death there was no reason why I should not return to the land of my birth, and my desire was the stronger because Eugenie-- the same Eugenie who has been thirty years my wife-- was of the same way of thinking as myself.

_She was looked at, however, and with some admiration; for, in her own hearing, two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl._<br/>` Ye are come in good time, gentlemen,' she answered, looking us straight in the eyes with a kindly smile as a sister might greet her brothers.

_Such words had their due effect; she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before-- her humble vanity was contented-- she felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a true-quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms, and went to her chair in good humour with everybody, and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention._<br/>We three practical men smiled when we heard that he had been elected as our colleague, and at the meeting we fixed it all up very nicely among ourselves without much thought of the old fellow who sat with his ears scooped forward in his hands, for he was a trifle hard of hearing, taking no more part in the proceedings than the gentlemen of the press who scribbled their notes on the back benches.

_CHAPTER 3  Every morning now brought its regular duties-- shops were to be visited; some new part of the town to be looked at; and the pump-room to be attended, where they paraded up and down for an hour, looking at everybody and speaking to no one._<br/> WE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B,-LSB- 5-RSB- Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting.

_The wish of a numerous acquaintance in Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen, and she repeated it after every fresh proof, which every morning brought, of her knowing nobody at all._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_They made their appearance in the Lower Rooms; and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine._<br/> Passing in succession a middle guard and an inner guard, the travellers came at last into the palace proper, and followed their majestic guide from chamber to chamber, each more wonderful than the last.

_The master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentlemanlike young man as a partner; his name was Tilney._<br/>The apprentice Derrick hath for a long time raised his eyes to his master's daughter, and the old man was ready to have him as a son, so much was he taken by his godliness and zeal.

_He seemed to be about four or five and twenty, was rather tall, had a pleasing countenance, a very intelligent and lively eye, and, if not quite handsome, was very near it._<br/> He was not a tall man, not more than five feet seven inches, and it was often said that if he had had an extra inch of reach he would have been a match for Jackson or Belcher at their best.

_His address was good, and Catherine felt herself in high luck._<br/>She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.''

_There was little leisure for speaking while they danced; but when they were seated at tea, she found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being._<br/>The novelty of her presence had brought a few curious invalids into her consulting-rooms, and, once there, they had been so impressed by the firmness of her manner and by the singular, new-fashioned instruments with which she tapped, and peered, and sounded, that it formed the core of their conversation for weeks afterwards.

_He talked with fluency and spirit-- and there was an archness and pleasantry in his manner which interested, though it was hardly understood by her._<br/>He, on his part, showed me no ill-will, but met me rather with a coarse joviality, and a rough familiarity which he meant to be ingratiating.

_After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them, he suddenly addressed her with--`` I have hitherto been very remiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a partner here; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath; whether you were ever here before; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms, the theatre, and the concert; and how you like the place altogether._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_I have been very negligent-- but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars?_<br/>It has taught me to be less remiss in saying what I think to be true, less indolent in doing what I feel to be rightful.''

_If you are I will begin directly.''_<br/>If you can do it, I know you will.'

_`` You need not give yourself that trouble, sir.''_<br/>`` Can not allow it, sir!''

_`` No trouble, I assure you, madam.''_<br/>`` No, no, thank you!

_Then forming his features into a set smile, and affectedly softening his voice, he added, with a simpering air,`` Have you been long in Bath, madam?''_<br/> I thought of the solicitude which he had shown over my toilet in the morning, his anxiety that I should make a favourable impression, his displeasure when she had been cold to me, and the smile upon his face when he had seen us hand in hand.

_`` About a week, sir,'' replied Catherine, trying not to laugh._<br/>`` My words were not addressed to you, sir,'' answered Sterne, looking rather frightened.

_`` Really!''_<br/>`` Really.

_with affected astonishment._<br/>I asked in astonishment.

_`` Why should you be surprised, sir?''_<br/>`` Why did he do that, sir?''

_`` Why, indeed!''_<br/>`` Why, that!''

_said he, in his natural tone._<br/>said he, in amazement.

_`` But some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply, and surprise is more easily assumed, and not less reasonable than any other._<br/>But I've something to do now which is more in my own line, and I need not trouble you any more.''

_Now let us go on._<br/>Let us go down.''

_Were you never here before, madam?''_<br/>And perhaps you never heard the name before?''

_`` Never, sir.''_<br/>`` Never better, sir.

_`` Indeed!_<br/>`` Indeed!''

_Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms?''_<br/>Have I not attended at the Temple?

_`` Yes, sir, I was there last Monday.''_<br/>`` Oh yes, doctor, last November.

_`` Have you been to the theatre?''_<br/>`` We were to go to the theatre.

_`` Yes, sir, I was at the play on Tuesday.''_<br/>`` Well, sir, you heard I was coming,'' said the smith.

_`` To the concert?''_<br/>`` Why the band?''

_`` Yes, sir, on Wednesday.''_<br/>`` Yes, sir.''

_`` And are you altogether pleased with Bath?''_<br/>`` But you are not satisfied, Charles.

_`` Yes-- I like it very well.''_<br/>`` I like him very much indeed.

_`` Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again.''_<br/>`` I should be glad to try you, if I may.''

_Catherine turned away her head, not knowing whether she might venture to laugh._<br/>She shook her head when she heard where I was going, but she did not say nay, and so it was settled.

_`` I see what you think of me,'' said he gravely--`` I shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow.''_<br/>I should have called upon you on the morning after the recapture of my father, but my knowledge of your dislike to visitors and also of-- you will excuse my saying it-- your very violent temper, led me to think that it was better to communicate with you by letter.

_`` My journal!''_<br/>`` My word!''

_`` Yes, I know exactly what you will say: Friday, went to the Lower Rooms; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings-- plain black shoes-- appeared to much advantage; but was strangely harassed by a queer, half-witted man, who would make me dance with him, and distressed me by his nonsense.''_<br/> When my uncle spoke like this there was always that dancing, mischievous light in his dark blue eyes, which showed me that this humour of his was a conscious eccentricity, depending, as I believe, upon a natural fastidiousness of taste, but wilfully driven to grotesque lengths for the very reason which made him recommend me also to develop some peculiarity of my own.

_`` Indeed I shall say no such thing.''_<br/>`` I will do no such thing.''

_`` Shall I tell you what you ought to say?''_<br/>`` Shall I tell you?''

_`` If you please.''_<br/>`` If I must.''

_`` I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced by Mr. King; had a great deal of conversation with him-- seems a most extraordinary genius-- hope I may know more of him._<br/> I was astounded to hear so delicate and personal a matter discussed in this public way, but this also was characteristic of the rule of this extraordinary man, who proclaimed that he looked upon delicacy and good taste as two of the fetters with which mediocrity attempted to cripple genius.

_That, madam, is what I wish you to say.''_<br/>`` Well, I love that you should think me so.

_`` But, perhaps, I keep no journal.''_<br/>`` No, I got no letter.''

_`` Perhaps you are not sitting in this room, and I am not sitting by you._<br/>`` I will not go upstairs,'' said I.`` I have all I want here.''

_These are points in which a doubt is equally possible._<br/>It is certain that there is a point where an ascent is possible.''

_Not keep a journal!_<br/>Not a word!

_How are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in Bath without one?_<br/>`` If it were not for our great ancestors and for our beloved country, the Queen of the Waters,'' said he,`` I could find it in my heart to be glad at this destruction which has come upon this vain and feeble generation.

_How are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be, unless noted down every evening in a journal?_<br/>`` You certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out, and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night's mystery.

_How are your various dresses to be remembered, and the particular state of your complexion, and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities, without having constant recourse to a journal?_<br/>My point is, that the physical phenomena which have been proved up to the hilt for all who care to examine the evidence, are really of no account, and that their real value consists in the fact that they support and give objective reality to an immense body of knowledge which must deeply modify our previous religious views, and must, when properly understood and digested, make religion a very real thing, no longer a matter of faith, but a matter of actual experience and fact.

_My dear madam, I am not so ignorant of young ladies' ways as you wish to believe me; it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated._<br/>The less experienced a doctor is, the higher are his notions of professional dignity, as I need not remind you, my young friend, so I was about to refuse the commission with indignation, when I bethought me that, quite apart from medicine, we were gentleman and lady, and that she had asked me to do something for her which was evidently of the greatest possible importance in her eyes.

_Everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female._<br/>What interested him was precisely what interested her, and she could meet him at every point upon equal terms.

_Nature may have done something, but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal.''_<br/>`` I may say in answer to your original question that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion.

_`` I have sometimes thought,'' said Catherine, doubtingly,`` whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen!_<br/>`` Miss Eva Cameron be her name, sir,'' she said:`` but who she be, or where she came fra, I know little more than yoursel'.

_That is-- I should not think the superiority was always on our side.''_<br/>I could not understand all that they said, but I was very sure about their general meaning.

_`` As far as I have had opportunity of judging, it appears to me that the usual style of letter-writing among women is faultless, except in three particulars.''_<br/> I was at my wit's ends what to do, whether to be silent, or to tell her of the terrible position in which her lover was placed; but, even as I hesitated, she, with the quick intuition of a woman, read the doubts which were in my mind.

_`` And what are they?''_<br/>`` And they?''

_`` A general deficiency of subject, a total inattention to stops, and a very frequent ignorance of grammar.''_<br/> I had to confess my total and humiliating ignorance of the subject at issue.

_`` Upon my word!_<br/>`` Upon my word!''

_I need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment._<br/>He would not resent it so much if he had not something to fear from it.

_You do not think too highly of us in that way.''_<br/>Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.'

_`` I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men, than that they sing better duets, or draw better landscapes._<br/> The plight of the officers was no better than that of the men, nor should an officer, my dears, when he is upon service, ever demean himself by partaking of any comfort which all can not share with him.

_In every power, of which taste is the foundation, excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes.''_<br/>His own frank and downright nature respected the same qualities in his neighbor, and a friendship sprang up between them which was more like that which exists between two men, founded upon esteem and a community of tastes.

_They were interrupted by Mrs. Allen:`` My dear Catherine,'' said she,`` do take this pin out of my sleeve; I am afraid it has torn a hole already; I shall be quite sorry if it has, for this is a favourite gown, though it cost but nine shillings a yard.''_<br/>` We, whose names are underwritten, do certify the miraculous cure of a girl of this town, about twenty, by name Elizabeth Parcet, a poor widow's daughter, who hath languished under sad affliction from that distemper of the king's evil termed the joint evil, being said to be the worst evil.

_`` That is exactly what I should have guessed it, madam,'' said Mr. Tilney, looking at the muslin._<br/>`` Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and the vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the speaking,'' said Holmes.

_`` Do you understand muslins, sir?''_<br/>`` How do you know that, sir?''

_`` Particularly well; I always buy my own cravats, and am allowed to be an excellent judge; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown._<br/>`` On the contrary, sister Mary,'' said my uncle, graciously,`` your son has been an excellent companion to me-- so much so that I fear that I am open to the charge of having neglected my dear Fidelio.

_I bought one for her the other day, and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it._<br/>When I asked him if he had bought it, he answered that it was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose interests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small commission.

_I gave but five shillings a yard for it, and a true Indian muslin.''_<br/>My homespun garments ware somewhat rough for such an occasion, yet I determined to appear in them, with the addition of a new black baize waistcoat faced with silk, and a good periwig, for which I gave three pounds ten shillings in the Haymarket.'

_Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius._<br/> Professor Ainslie Grey was as good as his word.

_`` Men commonly take so little notice of those things,'' said she;`` I can never get Mr. Allen to know one of my gowns from another._<br/>Yet during all that time I have never seen a finer man than Jim Belcher, and if I wish to match him in my memory, I can only turn to that other Jim whose fate and fortunes I am trying to lay before you.

_You must be a great comfort to your sister, sir.''_<br/>`` I should wish Ida to be my sister, and you my wife.''

_`` I hope I am, madam.''_<br/>`` I hope-- I hope you're well,'' she stammered.

_`` And pray, sir, what do you think of Miss Morland's gown?''_<br/>`` Oh, sir, see her boots and her dress!''

_`` It is very pretty, madam,'' said he, gravely examining it;`` but I do not think it will wash well; I am afraid it will fray.''_<br/>`` I am very sorry, Mr. Weld,'' said he,`` but I am afraid that I shall be compelled to dispense with your services.''

_`` How can you,'' said Catherine, laughing,`` be so--'' She had almost said`` strange.''_<br/>`` But I wonder that you should come and see me now, Rodney,'' said he, when we parted, trying to laugh as he spoke.

_`` I am quite of your opinion, sir,'' replied Mrs. Allen;`` and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it.''_<br/>`` Oh, George, I am so sorry you brought me back,'' she said, holding him by the hand.

_`` But then you know, madam, muslin always turns to some account or other; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief, or a cap, or a cloak._<br/>` If it please your Majesty,' Saxon answered,` it is like so much uncarded wool, which is rough enough in itself, and yet may in time come to be woven into a noble garment.'

_Muslin can never be said to be wasted._<br/>I never said anything, and I tried not to make myself ridiculous.

_I have heard my sister say so forty times, when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted, or careless in cutting it to pieces.''_<br/>His blood hath through his daughter been transmitted to the ten of us, though I rejoice to say that I, being the tenth, it had by that time lost much of its virulence, and indeed amounts to little more than a proper pride, and a laudable desire to prosper.'

_`` Bath is a charming place, sir; there are so many good shops here._<br/>` They breed a good old English stock in those parts,' said Monmouth;` but how comes it that you are here, sir?

_We are sadly off in the country; not but what we have very good shops in Salisbury, but it is so far to go-- eight miles is a long way; Mr. Allen says it is nine, measured nine; but I am sure it can not be more than eight; and it is such a fag-- I come back tired to death._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Now, here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes.''_<br/>We must be upon our way in five minutes.'

_Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said; and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced._<br/> When I looked at this splendid fellow, with his high-bred, clean-cut face, and thought of the fine qualities and gentle, generous impulses which I knew to lie within him, it seemed so absurd that he should speak as though my friendship towards him were a condescension, that I could not help laughing aloud.

_Catherine feared, as she listened to their discourse, that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others._<br/>He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.

_`` What are you thinking of so earnestly?''_<br/>`` What do you think of it?''

_said he, as they walked back to the ballroom;`` not of your partner, I hope, for, by that shake of the head, your meditations are not satisfactory.''_<br/>I took the precaution of walking the horse very quietly until we were some distance from the house, for I had told Reuben nothing of my intended journey, and I was convinced that if he knew of it neither discipline, nor even his new ties of love, would prevent him from coming with me.

_Catherine coloured, and said,`` I was not thinking of anything.''_<br/>`` I'm not much afraid of anything.''

_`` That is artful and deep, to be sure; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me.''_<br/>`` I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself.

_`` Well then, I will not.''_<br/>`` I will not.

_`` Thank you; for now we shall soon be acquainted, as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet, and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much.''_<br/>' I am glad to hear you say so,' I answered,` for it makes it easier for me to say that I wish to go my own way, and to have nothing more to do with you.

_They danced again; and, when the assembly closed, parted, on the lady's side at least, with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance._<br/>` It has now come to pass, however, that Monmouth, who has long lived in dalliance with the Midianitish woman known by the name of Wentworth, has at last turned him to higher things, and has consented to make a bid for the crown.

_Whether she thought of him so much, while she drank her warm wine and water, and prepared herself for bed, as to dream of him when there, can not be ascertained; but I hope it was no more than in a slight slumber, or a morning doze at most; for if it be true, as a celebrated writer has maintained, that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman's love is declared,* it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_How proper Mr. Tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen's head, but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied; for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was, and had been assured of Mr. Tilney's being a clergyman, and of a very respectable family in Gloucestershire._<br/>In his great goodness and self-abnegation he had, in his early declaration given forth at Lyme, declared that he should leave the choice of a monarch to the Commons of England, but having found that his enemies did most scandalously and basely make use of this his self-denial, and did assert that he had so little confidence in his own cause that he dared not take publicly the title which is due to him, he hath determined that this should have an end.

_CHAPTER 4  With more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump-room the next day, secure within herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the morning were over, and ready to meet him with a smile; but no smile was demanded-- Mr. Tilney did not appear._<br/>  CHAPTER VII `` To-morrow we Disappear into the Unknown''  I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner, nor will I tell of our week's stay at Para-LRB- save that I should wish to acknowledge the great kindness of the Pereira da Pinta Company in helping us to get together our equipment-RRB-.

_Every creature in Bath, except himself, was to be seen in the room at different periods of the fashionable hours; crowds of people were every moment passing in and out, up the steps and down; people whom nobody cared about, and nobody wanted to see; and he only was absent._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` What a delightful place Bath is,'' said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock, after parading the room till they were tired;`` and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here.''_<br/>As I sat alone at my breakfast-- Mrs. Challenger is in the habit of keeping her room of a morning-- it suddenly entered my head that it would be entertaining and instructive to see whether I could find any limits to this woman's inperturbability.

_This sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now; but we are told to`` despair of nothing we would attain,'' as`` unwearied diligence our point would gain''; and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its just reward, for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age, who was sitting by her, and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes, addressed her with great complaisance in these words:`` I think, madam, I can not be mistaken; it is a long time since I had the pleasure of seeing you, but is not your name Allen?''_<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_This question answered, as it readily was, the stranger pronounced hers to be Thorpe; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages, and that many years ago._<br/>He was married to the second daughter of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir Lothian's descendants have their eye upon the property, they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them.

_Their joy on this meeting was very great, as well it might, since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years._<br/>A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other.

_Compliments on good looks now passed; and, after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together, how little they had thought of meeting in Bath, and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend, they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families, sisters, and cousins, talking both together, far more ready to give than to receive information, and each hearing very little of what the other said._<br/> It was just three days after the Doctor and the Admiral had congratulated each other upon the closer tie which was to unite their two families, and to turn their friendship into something even dearer and more intimate, that Miss Ida Walker received a letter which caused her some surprise and considerable amusement.

_Mrs. Thorpe, however, had one great advantage as a talker, over Mrs. Allen, in a family of children; and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons, and the beauty of her daughters, when she related their different situations and views-- that John was at Oxford, Edward at Merchant Taylors', and William at sea-- and all of them more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were, Mrs. Allen had no similar information to give, no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend, and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions, consoling herself, however, with the discovery, which her keen eye soon made, that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe's pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_`` Here come my dear girls,'' cried Mrs. Thorpe, pointing at three smart-looking females who, arm in arm, were then moving towards her._<br/>`` Cocks and hens,'' cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise.

_`` My dear Mrs. Allen, I long to introduce them; they will be so delighted to see you: the tallest is Isabella, my eldest; is not she a fine young woman?_<br/>`` It is to ask the Empress herself whether what I say is not true, and to give her the glad tidings that her boy is alive and well.''

_The others are very much admired too, but I believe Isabella is the handsomest.''_<br/>He is very much in love with her, I assure you.

_The Miss Thorpes were introduced; and Miss Morland, who had been for a short time forgotten, was introduced likewise._<br/> And yet somehow the possibility and even the probability of it had occurred to me from the beginning, and I believe that it had to Harrison also, for I had noticed that his face grew grave and troubled from the very moment that there was talk of the stranger below.

_The name seemed to strike them all; and, after speaking to her with great civility, the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest,`` How excessively like her brother Miss Morland is!''_<br/>`` Come, come, my dear lady,'' said he,`` you speak vastly beyond my merits;'' upon which encouragement she started again in a theatrical apostrophe to Britain's darling and Neptune's eldest son, which he endured with the same signs of gratitude and pleasure.

_`` The very picture of him indeed!''_<br/>`` That's him!''

_cried the mother-- and`` I should have known her anywhere for his sister!''_<br/>cried her mother; and then, turning to me,' I will tell you all, sir.

_was repeated by them all, two or three times over._<br/>If all goes well you should be back in three or four days.

_For a moment Catherine was surprised; but Mrs. Thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with Mr. James Morland, before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college, of the name of Thorpe; and that he had spent the last week of the Christmas vacation with his family, near London._<br/>But, then, Champion Harrison told me how the fighting-men lived there, and my father how the heads of the Navy lived there, and my mother how her brother and his grand friends were there, until at last I was consumed with impatience to see this marvellous heart of England.

_The whole being explained, many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her; of being considered as already friends, through the friendship of their brothers, etc., which Catherine heard with pleasure, and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command; and, as the first proof of amity, she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe, and take a turn with her about the room._<br/> It was just three days after the Doctor and the Admiral had congratulated each other upon the closer tie which was to unite their two families, and to turn their friendship into something even dearer and more intimate, that Miss Ida Walker received a letter which caused her some surprise and considerable amusement.

_Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance, and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe._<br/>cried Lady Hamilton, and straightway she began to talk of the admiral and of his doings with such extravagance of praise and such a shower of compliments and of epithets, that my father and I did not know which way to look, feeling shame and sorrow for a man who was compelled to listen to such things said in his own presence.

_Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love._<br/>Show us your worst and we can face it, but it is when you are sweetest and smoothest that we have most to fear from you.

_Their conversation turned upon those subjects, of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies: such as dress, balls, flirtations, and quizzes._<br/>`` Then my wish is, that you should forget these odious notions which you have imbibed, that you should dress and act as you used to do, before ever you saw this woman, and that, in future, you confine your intercourse with her to such civilities as are necessary between neighbors.''

_Miss Thorpe, however, being four years older than Miss Morland, and at least four years better informed, had a very decided advantage in discussing such points; she could compare the balls of Bath with those of Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London; could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_These powers received due admiration from Catherine, to whom they were entirely new; and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity, had not the easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe's manners, and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her, softened down every feeling of awe, and left nothing but tender affection._<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_Their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump-room, but required, when they all quitted it together, that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen's house; and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands, after learning, to their mutual relief, that they should see each other across the theatre at night, and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning._<br/>Finally, it was not until after midnight that the four travelers were released at the entrance to Lord John Roxton's chambers in the Albany, and that the exuberant crowd, having sung` They are Jolly Good Fellows' in chorus, concluded their program with` God Save the King.'

_Catherine then ran directly upstairs, and watched Miss Thorpe's progress down the street from the drawing-room window; admired the graceful spirit of her walk, the fashionable air of her figure and dress; and felt grateful, as well she might, for the chance which had procured her such a friend._<br/> The abbot, who had made several visits to Constantinople upon the business of his monastery, walked with the assured step of one who knows his ground; while the boy, alarmed and yet pleased by the rush of people, the roar and clatter of passing chariots, and the vista of magnificent buildings, held tightly to the loose gown of his guide, while staring eagerly about him in every direction.

_Mrs. Thorpe was a widow, and not a very rich one; she was a good-humoured, well-meaning woman, and a very indulgent mother._<br/>`` And Clara is as bad, Clara who used to be so good and sweet, the very image of her poor mother.

_Her eldest daughter had great personal beauty, and the younger ones, by pretending to be as handsome as their sister, imitating her air, and dressing in the same style, did very well._<br/>To see their sons and daughters so flushed and healthy and happy, gave them also a reflected glow, and it was hard to say who had most pleasure from the game, those who played or those who watched.

_This brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity of a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself, of her past adventures and sufferings, which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters; in which the worthlessness of lords and attorneys might be set forth, and conversations, which had passed twenty years before, be minutely repeated._<br/>`` At the same time,'' said Challenger, his great voice booming strangely amid the silence,`` it is difficult for us to conceive that out of seven millions of people there is only this one old woman who by some peculiarity of constitution or some accident of occupation has managed to survive this catastrophe.''

_CHAPTER 5  Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening, in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe, though they certainly claimed much of her leisure, as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach; but she looked in vain._<br/>  CHAPTER VII `` To-morrow we Disappear into the Unknown''  I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner, nor will I tell of our week's stay at Para-LRB- save that I should wish to acknowledge the great kindness of the Pereira da Pinta Company in helping us to get together our equipment-RRB-.

_Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump-room._<br/>Stephen's was no bigger than Belmont's.

_She hoped to be more fortunate the next day; and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning, she hardly felt a doubt of it; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants, and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_As soon as divine service was over, the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other; and after staying long enough in the pump-room to discover that the crowd was insupportable, and that there was not a genteel face to be seen, which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season, they hastened away to the Crescent, to breathe the fresh air of better company._<br/>  CHAPTER VII `` To-morrow we Disappear into the Unknown''  I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner, nor will I tell of our week's stay at Para-LRB- save that I should wish to acknowledge the great kindness of the Pereira da Pinta Company in helping us to get together our equipment-RRB-.

_Here Catherine and Isabella, arm in arm, again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation; they talked much, and with much enjoyment; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner._<br/>`` Come, come, my dear lady,'' said he,`` you speak vastly beyond my merits;'' upon which encouragement she started again in a theatrical apostrophe to Britain's darling and Neptune's eldest son, which he endured with the same signs of gratitude and pleasure.

_He was nowhere to be met with; every search for him was equally unsuccessful, in morning lounges or evening assemblies; neither at the Upper nor Lower Rooms, at dressed or undressed balls, was he perceivable; nor among the walkers, the horsemen, or the curricle-drivers of the morning._<br/>He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of` Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.' There had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death.

_His name was not in the pump-room book, and curiosity could do no more._<br/>And indeed it was no wonder, for that name was never mentioned unless it were in connection with something brilliant and extraordinary.

_He must be gone from Bath._<br/>I must be gone.

_Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short!_<br/>He would not resent it so much if he had not something to fear from it.

_This sort of mysteriousness, which is always so becoming in a hero, threw a fresh grace in Catherine's imagination around his person and manners, and increased her anxiety to know more of him._<br/>For my own part, I was glad to throw off my gear, but I kept my attention all the while upon the movements of our host, whose graceful manners and learned appearance had aroused my curiosity and admiration.

_From the Thorpes she could learn nothing, for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen._<br/>She could wish nothing better than that Ida should be the wife of Harold Denver, and from the words which she had overheard as they left the lawn that evening, she could not doubt that there was some understanding between them.

_It was a subject, however, in which she often indulged with her fair friend, from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken._<br/>Now that they had not only ceased to protect him, but had themselves become a source of trouble to him, he began to understand how great the blessing was which he had enjoyed, and to sigh for the happy days before his girls had come under the influence of his neighbor.

_Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man, and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine, and would therefore shortly return._<br/>Well, she was a smart, kindly-hearted lass, and I was glad in my heart that the old seaman should have such a one to look after him.

_She liked him the better for being a clergyman,`` for she must confess herself very partial to the profession''; and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it._<br/>Mrs. Harrison loved Jim as if he had been her own son, and her husband loved mine, so they came to my help, and may God bless them for their kindness to a distracted wife and mother!

_Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion-- but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love, or the duties of friendship, to know when delicate raillery was properly called for, or when a confidence should be forced._<br/>I could not but observe, however, that her fall was very carefully executed, and that she was fortunate enough, in spite of her insensibility, to arrange her drapery and attitude into a graceful and classical design.

_Mrs. Allen was now quite happy-- quite satisfied with Bath._<br/>`` Commonplace,'' said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration.

_She had found some acquaintance, had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend; and, as the completion of good fortune, had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself._<br/>But I had not got half through my story, and Jim, like the good fellow that he was, had just begun to forget his own troubles in his delight at my good fortune, when my uncle called to me from without.

_Her daily expressions were no longer,`` I wish we had some acquaintance in Bath!''_<br/>They could no longer tell in that wild country in which direction I had gone.

_They were changed into,`` How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe!''_<br/>I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!''

_and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families, as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe, in what they called conversation, but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion, and not often any resemblance of subject, for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children, and Mrs. Allen of her gowns._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm, and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_They called each other by their Christian name, were always arm in arm when they walked, pinned up each other's train for the dance, and were not to be divided in the set; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments, they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt, and shut themselves up, to read novels together._<br/>I look back at the chain of incidents, my interview with McArdle, Challenger's first note of alarm in the Times, the absurd journey in the train, the pleasant luncheon, the catastrophe, and now it has come to this-- that we linger alone upon an empty planet, and so sure is our fate that I can regard these lines, written from mechanical professional habit and never to be seen by human eyes, as the words of one who is already dead, so closely does he stand to the shadowed borderland over which all outside this one little circle of friends have already gone.

_Yes, novels; for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding-- joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Alas!_<br/>Alas!

_If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard?_<br/>The only thing which troubles me is whether it may not be so important as to forbid me from broaching it to you, or indeed, to anybody save the Empress Theodora, since it is she only whom it concerns.''

_I can not approve of it._<br/>`` I can not understand you.

_Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Let us not desert one another; we are an injured body._<br/>Surely you will not desert me.

_Although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world, no species of composition has been so much decried._<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our foes are almost as many as our readers._<br/>Through all his fear, however, there was a suspicion of triumph in his tone and manner.

_And while the abilities of the nine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and Prior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne, are eulogized by a thousand pens-- there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and of slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste to recommend them._<br/>_-RSB-  THE END    THE GREAT KEINPLATZ EXPERIMENT  And Other Tales of Twilight and the Unseen  by  A.

_`` I am no novel-reader-- I seldom look into novels-- Do not imagine that I often read novels-- It is really very well for a novel.''_<br/>And indeed it was no wonder, for that name was never mentioned unless it were in connection with something brilliant and extraordinary.

_Such is the common cant._<br/>This is not.''

_`` And what are you reading, Miss--?''_<br/>What were you reading?''

_`` Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_It is only a novel!''_<br/>It's only a name.

_replies the young lady, while she lays down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame._<br/>When he at last regained his utterance, he indulged in such a bellow of passion that the young lady dropped back, petrified with fear, into an arm-chair.

_`` It is only Cecilia, or Camilla, or Belinda''; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language._<br/>That colour alone showed that she could be none other than the Empress; but the dignity of her carriage, the fierce authority of her magnificent dark eyes, and the perfect beauty of her haughty face, all proclaimed that it could only be that of Theodora who, in spite of her lowly origin, was the most majestic as well as the most maturely lovely of all the women in her kingdom.

_Now, had the same young lady been engaged with a volume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly would she have produced the book, and told its name; though the chances must be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication, of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of taste: the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and topics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living; and their language, too, frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_CHAPTER 6  The following conversation, which took place between the two friends in the pump-room one morning, after an acquaintance of eight or nine days, is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment, and of the delicacy, discretion, originality of thought, and literary taste which marked the reasonableness of that attachment._<br/>  VI  THE SEALED ROOM  A solicitor of an active habit and athletic tastes who is compelled by his hopes of business to remain within the four walls of his office from ten till five must take what exercise he can in the evenings.

_They met by appointment; and as Isabella had arrived nearly five minutes before her friend, her first address naturally was,`` My dearest creature, what can have made you so late?_<br/> And so for ten minutes he plied me with questions, which showed me clearly that the Emperor had read him aright, and that he was determined, come what might, to be upon the side which won.

_I have been waiting for you at least this age!''_<br/>I've been waiting for two hours.'

_`` Have you, indeed!_<br/>`` Oh, indeed!

_I am very sorry for it; but really I thought I was in very good time._<br/>I'm awfully sorry if I seemed to doubt you.

_It is but just one._<br/>So it was even now.

_I hope you have not been here long?''_<br/>We shall not have to wait long now.'

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_These ten ages at least._<br/>You look eighteen, at the least.

_I am sure I have been here this half hour._<br/>Then I am a quarter of an hour late already.

_But now, let us go and sit down at the other end of the room, and enjoy ourselves._<br/>If we sit at the window we shall see him coming down the road.''

_I have an hundred things to say to you._<br/>-- a hundred times I have said it.''

_In the first place, I was so afraid it would rain this morning, just as I wanted to set off; it looked very showery, and that would have thrown me into agonies!_<br/>I wandered on then, wet and weary, trusting to fortune, but always blundering deeper and deeper into this horrible bog, until I began to think that my first night in France was destined also to be my last, and that the heir of the de Lavals was destined to perish of cold and misery in the depths of this obscene morass.

_Do you know, I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine, in a shop window in Milsom Street just now-- very like yours, only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green; I quite longed for it._<br/> To every traveller it was a sight of beauty, but to me it was the world-- the great wide free world-- and my heart thrilled and fluttered as the young bird's may when it first hears the whirr of its own flight, and skims along with the blue heaven above it and the green fields beneath.

_But, my dearest Catherine, what have you been doing with yourself all this morning?_<br/>`` But we have already taken too much of your time, and so I beg to thank you for your kindness and to wish you good morning.''

_Have you gone on with Udolpho?''_<br/>You say that Beaufort gave you nought in writing?'

_`` Yes, I have been reading it ever since I woke; and I am got to the black veil.''_<br/>` Not I, forsooth, for I have ever kept myself clear of black magic or diablerie of the sort.

_`` Are you, indeed?_<br/>` And are you indeed scathless?'

_How delightful!_<br/>Wonderful!''

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_I would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world!_<br/>I would not believe them, I _ could _ not believe them-- for I did not know that there was upon this earth a thing so contemptible.

_Are not you wild to know?''_<br/>Is not this so?''

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Yes, quite; what can it be?_<br/>But how could that be?

_But do not tell me-- I would not be told upon any account._<br/>I suppose that you did not touch any of them?''

_I know it must be a skeleton, I am sure it is Laurentina's skeleton._<br/>` What with too little that is solid and too much that is liquid I am like to be skeleton Reuben ere I see Havant again.

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_I am delighted with the book!_<br/>I am so pleased.

_I should like to spend my whole life in reading it._<br/>I would spend the day in writing a third, which would bring my experiences absolutely up to date.

_I assure you, if it had not been to meet you, I would not have come away from it for all the world.''_<br/>But it could n't have been so very deep, could it, if you could go off to the other end of the world and leave me here alone.

_`` Dear creature!_<br/>`` Dear!

_How much I am obliged to you; and when you have finished Udolpho, we will read the Italian together; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you.''_<br/>We've been goin' this twenty year, but now we'll draw aside and let our betters get to the front; so if you wish to find what that note means, I can only advise you to do what you are asked, and to drive over to Cliffe Royal, where you will find out.''

_`` Have you, indeed!_<br/>`` Oh, indeed!

_How glad I am!_<br/>Oh, I am so glad.''

_What are they all?''_<br/>How are you all?

_`` I will read you their names directly; here they are, in my pocketbook._<br/>`` I'll have my rights, I tell you.

_Castle of Wolfenbach, Clermont, Mysterious Warnings, Necromancer of the Black Forest, Midnight Bell, Orphan of the Rhine, and Horrid Mysteries._<br/>`` When thy star is in trine, Between darkness and shine, Duke Monmouth, Duke Monmouth, Beware of the Rhine!''

_Those will last us some time.''_<br/>This is our last chance.''

_`` Yes, pretty well; but are they all horrid, are you sure they are all horrid?''_<br/> We did indeed, but they were of a terrible and most unexpected nature.

_`` Yes, quite sure; for a particular friend of mine, a Miss Andrews, a sweet girl, one of the sweetest creatures in the world, has read every one of them._<br/>`` You will permit me to compliment you, my dear Mary,'' said he, in a voice which was the most mellow and beautiful that I have ever heard.

_I wish you knew Miss Andrews, you would be delighted with her._<br/>I know how delighted she will be.''

_She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive._<br/>Fly, my sweetest, move those dainty feet of thine, for egad!

_I think her as beautiful as an angel, and I am so vexed with the men for not admiring her!_<br/>For my own part I was not so very anxious that she should save this craven lover of hers, whose handsome face belied the poor spirit within him.

_I scold them all amazingly about it.''_<br/>I fear that it is all over with them.''

_`` Scold them!_<br/>`` Pardon me!''

_Do you scold them for not admiring her?''_<br/>` Are you not afraid for yourself?'

_`` Yes, that I do._<br/>`` Yes, I did.''

_There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends._<br/>`` There's nothing would please me better, but you heard for yourself.''

_I have no notion of loving people by halves; it is not my nature._<br/>Verily there is no possible way by which a truth can be proved by which this truth has not been proved.

_My attachments are always excessively strong._<br/>You have always been so strong, so above me.

_I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night, I would not dance with him, unless he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel._<br/>It was this imminence of the danger which warmed our hearts to our sailors, and made us talk, round the winter fires, of our little Nelson, and Cuddie Collingwood, and Johnnie Jarvis, and the rest of them, not as being great High Admirals with titles and dignities, but as good friends whom we loved and honoured above all others.

_The men think us incapable of real friendship, you know, and I am determined to show them the difference._<br/>When men like yourself, who represent the foolish curiosity of the public, came to disturb my privacy I was unable to meet them with dignified reserve.

_Now, if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you, I should fire up in a moment: but that is not at all likely, for you are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men.''_<br/>All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,-- for you have not done me a very good turn,-- but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.''

_`` Oh, dear!''_<br/>`` Oh, dear!

_cried Catherine, colouring._<br/>Mary cried.

_`` How can you say so?''_<br/>How could you possibly know?

_`` I know you very well; you have so much animation, which is exactly what Miss Andrews wants, for I must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her._<br/> I was at my wit's ends what to do, whether to be silent, or to tell her of the terrible position in which her lover was placed; but, even as I hesitated, she, with the quick intuition of a woman, read the doubts which were in my mind.

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_I must tell you, that just after we parted yesterday, I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly-- I am sure he is in love with you.''_<br/>I confess that from what I see of the young man's character I should not say that he is worthy of your love.'

_Catherine coloured, and disclaimed again._<br/>She coloured and hesitated.

_Isabella laughed._<br/>The Admiral laughed.

_`` It is very true, upon my honour, but I see how it is; you are indifferent to everybody's admiration, except that of one gentleman, who shall be nameless._<br/>I am so sorry to cause you any disappointment, and I appreciate most highly the honour which you do me, but what you ask is quite impossible.''

_Nay, I can not blame you''-- speaking more seriously--`` your feelings are easily understood._<br/>I can not with justice blame you personally for what has occurred.

_Where the heart is really attached, I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else._<br/>What I wanted to say is that if you would like to have a second opinion I shall be very glad to meet any one whom you might suggest.''

_Everything is so insipid, so uninteresting, that does not relate to the beloved object!_<br/>Well, my dears, it is useless for me to expound to you that which I can not myself understand.

_I can perfectly comprehend your feelings.''_<br/>`` All that you say is perfectly true.

_`` But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney, for perhaps I may never see him again.''_<br/>`` And as far as I can help,'' said Harvey Deacon,`` it will certainly never be done again.''

_`` Not see him again!_<br/>`` Not take him!''

_My dearest creature, do not talk of it._<br/>Of mine I can not yet speak.

_I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so!''_<br/>I am sure he would be miserable.''

_`` No, indeed, I should not._<br/>`` No, I will not.''

_I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him; but while I have Udolpho to read, I feel as if nobody could make me miserable._<br/>I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me.

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_The dreadful black veil!_<br/>And this dreadful smell!''

_My dear Isabella, I am sure there must be Laurentina's skeleton behind it.''_<br/>`` I am sure,'' said she,`` that dear mother would like papa to do whatever would make him most happy.

_`` It is so odd to me, that you should never have read Udolpho before; but I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels.''_<br/> This is the letter which I read: `` MY EVER DEAREST WIFE,-- `` Since Sir William told me how weak your heart is, and how harmful any shock might be, I have never talked about my business affairs to you.

_`` No, she does not._<br/>`` No, I can not.''

_She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself; but new books do not fall in our way.''_<br/>Again, if Miss Julia Ames can tell Mr. Stead things in her own earth life of which he could not have cognisance, and if those things are shown, when tested, to be true, then one is more inclined to think that those things which can not be tested are true also.

_`` Sir Charles Grandison!_<br/>`` Yes, Sir Charles.''

_That is an amazing horrid book, is it not?_<br/>Say, it's awful dry, ai n't it?

_I remember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume.''_<br/>I did not know which way to turn or what I should do first.

_`` It is not like Udolpho at all; but yet I think it is very entertaining.''_<br/> We thought him very wicked then, but, looking back, I am not sure that we were not very wicked ourselves.

_`` Do you indeed!_<br/>`` Do it!''

_You surprise me; I thought it had not been readable._<br/>It would not have been a surprise to him.

_But, my dearest Catherine, have you settled what to wear on your head tonight?_<br/>You will, I am sure, make allowances, lieutenant, when I tell you that your prisoner of last night was a very dear friend of my daughter's.

_I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you._<br/>I am most anxious to be of use to you.

_The men take notice of that sometimes, you know.''_<br/>Because he has thought for the men, and so the men have thought for him.

_`` But it does not signify if they do,'' said Catherine, very innocently._<br/>`` I confess,'' said I,`` that I do not quite follow you.''

_`` Signify!_<br/>`` Profound!

_Oh, heavens!_<br/>`` Good heavens!''

_I make it a rule never to mind what they say._<br/>I think it is safe to say that things can never be quite the same again.

_They are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit, and make them keep their distance.''_<br/>They were long messages very often, spelled out by tilts, and it was quite impossible that they came by chance.

_`` Are they?_<br/>`` And they?''

_Well, I never observed that._<br/>But I never believed in such things.

_They always behave very well to me.''_<br/>You always remind me of a steamengine.''

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_They give themselves such airs._<br/>They watch us.

_They are the most conceited creatures in the world, and think themselves of so much importance!_<br/>They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening.

_By the by, though I have thought of it a hundred times, I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man._<br/>What sort of a man could he be who during thirty years of his life had never made a single friend, high or low, who cared to continue to keep in touch with him?

_Do you like them best dark or fair?''_<br/>Do your best.

_`` I hardly know._<br/>`` Well, hardly that.

_I never much thought about it._<br/>I never thought of it before.

_Something between both, I think._<br/>That's all, I think.

_Brown-- not fair, and-- and not very dark.''_<br/>Nay, turn not pale!

_`` Very well, Catherine._<br/>`` Very well, ma'am.''

_That is exactly he._<br/>`` Which is he?''

_I have not forgot your description of Mr. Tilney--' a brown skin, with dark eyes, and rather dark hair.'_<br/>I am not one who, for the sake of a white skin or a blue eye, would belie my own life, and change the whole tenor of my thoughts and existence.

_Well, my taste is different._<br/>But here it is different.

_I prefer light eyes, and as to complexion-- do you know-- I like a sallow better than any other._<br/>I believe that you could do it better than any one.

_You must not betray me, if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description.''_<br/>` You must not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.'

_`` Betray you!_<br/>`` You!''

_What do you mean?''_<br/>What do you mean?''

_`` Nay, do not distress me._<br/>`` Nay, I know not.''

_I believe I have said too much._<br/>I thought as much.

_Let us drop the subject.''_<br/>Let us go down.''

_Catherine, in some amazement, complied, and after remaining a few moments silent, was on the point of reverting to what interested her at that time rather more than anything else in the world, Laurentina's skeleton, when her friend prevented her, by saying,`` For heaven's sake!_<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Let us move away from this end of the room._<br/>We shall move into the next room.

_Do you know, there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour._<br/>To think that only a few hours before we had left this very spot with such high hopes and all fair prospects for our mission, and now the remnants of us waited as beaten and humiliated men for whatever lot a brutal enemy might ordain!

_They really put me quite out of countenance._<br/>Yes, I do very much mind.''

_Let us go and look at the arrivals._<br/>Let us look at it from his point of view.

_They will hardly follow us there.''_<br/>`` They can see us and we can not see them.

_Away they walked to the book; and while Isabella examined the names, it was Catherine's employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men._<br/> Mr. Cecil Brown-- to take the names in the chance order in which they appear upon the passenger list-- was a young diplomatist from a Continental Embassy, a man slightly tainted with the Oxford manner, and erring upon the side of unnatural and inhuman refinement, but full of interesting talk and cultured thought.

_`` They are not coming this way, are they?_<br/>`` You're not going yet?''

_I hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us._<br/>I hope we shall not lose sight of you.''

_Pray let me know if they are coming._<br/>Then let them do what they will.

_I am determined I will not look up.''_<br/>I am not likely to forget it.''

_In a few moments Catherine, with unaffected pleasure, assured her that she need not be longer uneasy, as the gentlemen had just left the pump-room._<br/> I had been forgotten during this episode, and though I am not a man who is accustomed to being overlooked I should have been all the happier had they continued to neglect me.

_`` And which way are they gone?''_<br/>`` And why did they leave?''

_said Isabella, turning hastily round._<br/>she said, looking round.

_`` One was a very good-looking young man.''_<br/>This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow.

_`` They went towards the church-yard.''_<br/> He went in through the garden.

_`` Well, I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them!_<br/>`` I am very pleased to hear you speak so sensibly, my dears.

_And now, what say you to going to Edgar's Buildings with me, and looking at my new hat?_<br/>` You said to me that the Emperor was out, and here is his hat!'

_You said you should like to see it.''_<br/>You will see to it.''

_Catherine readily agreed._<br/>`` It certainly does,'' I agreed.

_`` Only,'' she added,`` perhaps we may overtake the two young men.''_<br/>If I know anything o' that young man, he'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.''

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Never mind that._<br/>Never mind manoeuvres!

_If we make haste, we shall pass by them presently, and I am dying to show you my hat.''_<br/>If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for.

_`` But if we only wait a few minutes, there will be no danger of our seeing them at all.''_<br/>`` But there is no use our going out of our way to incur danger.''

_`` I shall not pay them any such compliment, I assure you._<br/>`` I trust that I shall not be compelled to disturb you.''

_I have no notion of treating men with such respect._<br/>`` I give no man reasons for my conduct.''

_That is the way to spoil them.''_<br/>What a pity to spoil it!

_Catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning; and therefore, to show the independence of Miss Thorpe, and her resolution of humbling the sex, they set off immediately as fast as they could walk, in pursuit of the two young men._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_CHAPTER 7  Half a minute conducted them through the pump-yard to the archway, opposite Union Passage; but here they were stopped._<br/>  CHAPTER VII  There was nothing to show them as they journeyed onwards that they were not on the very spot that they had passed at sunset upon the evening before.

_Everybody acquainted with Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap Street at this point; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature, so unfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads, and the principal inn of the city, that a day never passes in which parties of ladies, however important their business, whether in quest of pastry, millinery, or even-LRB- as in the present case-RRB- of young men, are not detained on one side or other by carriages, horsemen, or carts._<br/>For the wealthy dignitaries of the Church, rolling in their carriages to their cathedrals, in order to preach the doctrines of their Master, who wore His sandals out in tramping over the countryside, he professed the most bitter contempt; nor was he more lenient to those poorer members of the clergy who winked at the vices of their patrons that they might secure a seat at their table, and who would sit through a long evening of profanity rather than bid good-bye to the cheesecakes and the wine flask.

_This evil had been felt and lamented, at least three times a day, by Isabella since her residence in Bath; and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more, for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage, and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds, and threading the gutters of that interesting alley, they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig, driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing-looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself, his companion, and his horse._<br/>It reminded him, he said, of a similar stratagem executed at Market Drayton by that God-fearing soldier Colonel Pride, whereby a captain and three troopers of Lunsford's own regiment of horse had been drowned, and many others precipitated into a river, to the great glory of the true Church and to the satisfaction of the chosen people.

_`` Oh, these odious gigs!''_<br/>`` Oh, chuck the infernal thing away!''

_said Isabella, looking up._<br/>said she, looking out.

_`` How I detest them.''_<br/>How you must hate and loathe me!

_But this detestation, though so just, was of short duration, for she looked again and exclaimed,`` Delightful!_<br/>She felt suddenly that she was giving herself away, and she changed her face to a kindly, friendly smile, but it was too late, for I had had my warning.

_Mr. Morland and my brother!''_<br/>said my uncle.

_`` Good heaven!_<br/>`` Good heaven!''

_'T is James!''_<br/>'T is he.

_was uttered at the same moment by Catherine; and, on catching the young men's eyes, the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches, and the servant having now scampered up, the gentlemen jumped out, and the equipage was delivered to his care._<br/> Whilst we were talking the men whom we had left with the horses had come up, together with some of the neighbouring farmers and cottagers, who were aghast at the scene of slaughter, and much troubled in their minds over the vengeance which might be exacted by the Royal troops next day.

_Catherine, by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected, received her brother with the liveliest pleasure; and he, being of a very amiable disposition, and sincerely attached to her, gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction, which he could have leisure to do, while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid, with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine, had she been more expert in the development of other people's feelings, and less simply engrossed by her own, that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_John Thorpe, who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses, soon joined them, and from him she directly received the amends which were her due; for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of Isabella, on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow._<br/>` With all humbleness, your Majesty,' said Lord Grey, who had just returned with the horse,' I should suggest, since there are only a few troops of their cavalry on this side of the Avon, that we blow up the bridge and move onwards to Bath, whence we can pass into Wiltshire, which we know to be friendly.'

_He was a stout young man of middling height, who, with a plain face and ungraceful form, seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he wore the dress of a groom, and too much like a gentleman unless he were easy where he ought to be civil, and impudent where he might be allowed to be easy._<br/>That a man of the world, five-and-forty years of age, shrewd, honest, and acquainted with Courts, should be beguiled by such crude and coarse homage, amazed me, as it did all who knew him; but you who have seen much of life do not need to be told how often the strongest and noblest nature has its one inexplicable weakness, showing up the more obviously in contrast to the rest, as the dark stain looks the fouler upon the whitest sheet.

_He took out his watch:`` How long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury, Miss Morland?''_<br/> So the promise was made, and very faithfully did Jim keep it, for many a time when I have wanted him to go fishing or rabbit-snaring, he has remembered that it was his day for Miss Hinton, and has tramped off to Anstey Cross.

_`` I do not know the distance.''_<br/>`` I do not know.''

_Her brother told her that it was twenty-three miles._<br/>She went likewise ten or eleven miles to a seventh son, but all in vain.

_`` Three and twenty!''_<br/>`` Seven to five!''

_cried Thorpe._<br/>cried Stephens.

_`` Five and twenty if it is an inch.''_<br/>Now it has twenty-two.

_Morland remonstrated, pleaded the authority of road-books, innkeepers, and milestones; but his friend disregarded them all; he had a surer test of distance._<br/>And she, the polluted one, had risen to the dignity, had cut herself sternly away from all that related to her past life, and had shown signs already of being a great Queen, stronger and wiser than her husband, but fierce, vindictive, and unbending, a firm support to her friends, but a terror to her foes.

_`` I know it must be five and twenty,'' said he,`` by the time we have been doing it._<br/>I have but seen them this once in ten years, and it may be ten more, for all I know, ere I see them again.

_It is now half after one; we drove out of the inn-yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven; and I defy any man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness; that makes it exactly twenty-five.''_<br/> My uncle's fears as to our being blocked upon the road were only too well founded, for after we passed Reigate there was such a procession of every sort of vehicle, that I believe for the whole eight miles there was not a horse whose nose was further than a few feet from the back of the curricle or barouche in front.

_`` You have lost an hour,'' said Morland;`` it was only ten o'clock when we came from Tetbury.''_<br/>`` It's a hundred that you do n't see us before Westminster with a quarter of an hour's start,'' said Sir John.

_`` Ten o'clock!_<br/>` Twenty.'

_It was eleven, upon my soul!_<br/>`` It was seven to one against me, yesterday.

_I counted every stroke._<br/>I repeated.

_This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses, Miss Morland; do but look at my horse; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life?''_<br/>I was convinced that Mortimer Tregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money, and with the idea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all insane he would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the devil's- foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses, and killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever loved or who has ever loved me.

_-LRB- The servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving off.-RRB-_<br/>The servant said that the gentleman had ordered a cab the instant that I had left, and had gone off in it.

_`` Such true blood!_<br/>True enough!

_Three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles!_<br/>It's three or four miles from here.

_Look at that creature, and suppose it possible if you can.''_<br/>Look up and see if you can see aught of it.'

_`` He does look very hot, to be sure.''_<br/>`` Oh, he might look very much like you.''

_`` Hot!_<br/>_'' '' _ Egyptien!

_He had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church; but look at his forehand; look at his loins; only see how he moves; that horse can not go less than ten miles an hour: tie his legs and he will get on._<br/>I find,'' he continued, glancing over the pages of his ledger,`` that within the last twelve months we have supplied no fewer than seven Latin masters to Willow Lea House Academy, four of them having left so abruptly as to forfeit their month's salary, and none of them having stayed more than eight weeks.''

_What do you think of my gig, Miss Morland?_<br/>But what do you know of Gaster Fell, Miss Cameron?''

_A neat one, is not it?_<br/>That is one, is it not?''

_Well hung; town-built; I have not had it a month._<br/>And yet the day may come when I would not have it otherwise.

_It was built for a Christchurch man, a friend of mine, a very good sort of fellow; he ran it a few weeks, till, I believe, it was convenient to have done with it._<br/>It is pleasant to think that five years afterward, when Lord Rufton came to Paris after the peace, he was able to assure me that my name was still a famous one in the north of Devonshire for the fine exploits that I had performed.

_I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind, though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too; but I chanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge, as he was driving into Oxford, last term:` Ah!_<br/>I had determined to give you notice when we reached Brighton; but as we drove from the village that day, I caught a glimpse of a lady passing in a phaeton between whom and Lord Avon I was well aware there was a close intimacy, although I was not certain that she was actually his wife.

_Thorpe,' said he,` do you happen to want such a little thing as this?_<br/>`` Now,'' said he,`` what am I do to earn this?''

_It is a capital one of the kind, but I am cursed tired of it.'_<br/>You are tired of me, and by the gods I am tired of you, and glad to be at the end of it.

_` Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_D--,' said I;' I am your man; what do you ask?'_<br/>`` Now,'' said he,`` what am I do to earn this?''

_And how much do you think he did, Miss Morland?''_<br/>But what do you know of Gaster Fell, Miss Cameron?''

_`` I am sure I can not guess at all.''_<br/>`` Because I am not sure.

_`` Curricle-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case, splashing-board, lamps, silver moulding, all you see complete; the iron-work as good as new, or better._<br/>  Chapter V  THE DEAD WORLD  I remember that we all sat gasping in our chairs, with that sweet, wet south-western breeze, fresh from the sea, flapping the muslin curtains and cooling our flushed faces.

_He asked fifty guineas; I closed with him directly, threw down the money, and the carriage was mine.''_<br/>I give ye my word that only a week gone last Friday I stopped a grazier coming from Blandford fair, and I took seven hundred guineas off him in these paper cheques, as they call them-- enough, had it been in gold, to have lasted me for a three month rouse.

_`` And I am sure,'' said Catherine,`` I know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear.''_<br/>` At least he did not refuse you,' said I.` It is as good as a promise that; should the cause be successful, you shall be so too.'

_`` Neither one nor t` other; I might have got it for less, I dare say; but I hate haggling, and poor Freeman wanted cash.''_<br/>`` They do not love the blockading service, and it is little wonder, since neither money nor honour is to be gained at it.

_`` That was very good-natured of you,'' said Catherine, quite pleased._<br/>`` You look very happy,'' said he.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_D-- it, when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend, I hate to be pitiful.''_<br/>It was a loathsome adventure, and one of which I hate to think.

_An inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young ladies; and, on finding whither they were going, it was decided that the gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar's Buildings, and pay their respects to Mrs. Thorpe._<br/>'`` Having heard from your father, my dear lad, that there was some chance of being able to send a letter to you, I have written this, and am now sending it under the charge of the worthy John Packingham, of Chichester, who is bound for the West.

_James and Isabella led the way; and so well satisfied was the latter with her lot, so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother's friend, and her friend's brother, so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings, that, though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street, she was so far from seeking to attract their notice, that she looked back at them only three times._<br/>`` My name is Sawyer-- her's is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her-- and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he's at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops--'' `` Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,'' I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion;`` it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.''

_John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine, and, after a few minutes' silence, renewed the conversation about his gig._<br/> Having got so far, Defoe remarked that he thought he had given them a fair start, and handed over the story to Dean Swift, who, after premising that he feared he would find himself as much at sea as Master Cyprian Overbeck Wells, continued in this way:-- `` For two days I drifted about in great distress, fearing that there should be a return of the gale, and keeping an eager look-out for my late companions.

_`` You will find, however, Miss Morland, it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people, for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day; Jackson, of Oriel, bid me sixty at once; Morland was with me at the time.''_<br/>I give ye my word that only a week gone last Friday I stopped a grazier coming from Blandford fair, and I took seven hundred guineas off him in these paper cheques, as they call them-- enough, had it been in gold, to have lasted me for a three month rouse.

_`` Yes,'' said Morland, who overheard this;`` but you forget that your horse was included.''_<br/>'' Tis but my horse in the stall below,' I answered.

_`` My horse!_<br/>` My horse!'

_Oh, d-- it!_<br/>Oh, lack-a-day, lack-a-day!

_I would not sell my horse for a hundred._<br/>You would n't think the mares had come fifty miles, would you?

_Are you fond of an open carriage, Miss Morland?''_<br/>Now let me see, which of you is Miss Williams, and which Miss Bertha Williams?''

_`` Yes, very; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one; but I am particularly fond of it.''_<br/>` It is true; and yet I never expected that I should be on such terms with you.

_`` I am glad of it; I will drive you out in mine every day.''_<br/>`` I am glad to come if I can do any good by coming.''

_`` Thank you,'' said Catherine, in some distress, from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer._<br/>`` Well, well, it's rather a delicate question to answer,'' said Dr. Proudie, with a show of embarrassment.

_`` I will drive you up Lansdown Hill tomorrow.''_<br/>`` Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester.

_`` Thank you; but will not your horse want rest?''_<br/>` May not our horse advance?'

_`` Rest!_<br/>_'' '' _ Egyptien!

_He has only come three and twenty miles today; all nonsense; nothing ruins horses so much as rest; nothing knocks them up so soon._<br/>`` We could not have been moving more than fourteen or fifteen hours, and a camel seldom goes more than two and a half miles an hour unless he is trotting.

_No, no; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while I am here.''_<br/>No time to stop, for we shall be in action again in five minutes.

_`` Shall you indeed!''_<br/>` And you!'

_said Catherine very seriously._<br/>said Mary.

_`` That will be forty miles a day.''_<br/>That would be sixty per cent a year.''

_`` Forty!_<br/>` Twenty.'

_Aye, fifty, for what I care._<br/>Some eight hundred, I think.''

_Well, I will drive you up Lansdown tomorrow; mind, I am engaged.''_<br/>Now drive with me to High Combe, and I will explain as we go.''

_`` How delightful that will be!''_<br/>`` How long will this be?''

_cried Isabella, turning round._<br/>he cried,`` Lucia!''

_`` My dearest Catherine, I quite envy you; but I am afraid, brother, you will not have room for a third.''_<br/>she cried,`` and asking your pardon for troubling you, but I'm feared o' the young leddy, sir; she is not in her room.''

_`` A third indeed!_<br/>`` A new one!

_No, no; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about; that would be a good joke, faith!_<br/>None of your jokes, Don Decimo, for by the Lord I'll let drive at you if you were my own mother's son.

_Morland must take care of you.''_<br/>Which do you care to use?''

_This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two; but Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result._<br/> The Colonel had not understood this sudden change, nor had the others fathomed the reason of it, but some instinct flashed it upon Stephens's horrified perceptions.

_Her companion's discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met; and Catherine, after listening and agreeing as long as she could, with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind, fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a self-assured man, especially where the beauty of her own sex is concerned, ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts; it was,`` Have you ever read Udolpho, Mr. Thorpe?''_<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_`` Udolpho!_<br/>`` Murder!''

_Oh, Lord!_<br/>`` Oh, Lord!''

_Not I; I never read novels; I have something else to do.''_<br/>I never have anything to do.

_Catherine, humbled and ashamed, was going to apologize for her question, but he prevented her by saying,`` Novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones, except The Monk; I read that t` other day; but as for all the others, they are the stupidest things in creation.''_<br/> I was amazed at the interest and knowledge which all these great people showed about the ring, for they not only had the deeds of the principal men of the time-- Belcher, Mendoza, Jackson, or Dutch Sam-- at their fingers' ends, but there was no fighting man so obscure that they did not know the details of his deeds and prospects.

_`` I think you must like Udolpho, if you were to read it; it is so very interesting.''_<br/>`` I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for you already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you should know all.

_`` Not I, faith!_<br/>`` Not I!''

_No, if I read any, it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe's; her novels are amusing enough; they are worth reading; some fun and nature in them.''_<br/>No, Mr. Malone, I will place no restriction upon your correspondence, since the ventilation of the facts is the object of your journey; but I demand that you shall give no particulars as to your exact destination, and that nothing be actually published until your return.

_`` Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe,'' said Catherine, with some hesitation, from the fear of mortifying him._<br/> I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered.

_`` No sure; was it?_<br/>`` No thought of it.''

_Aye, I remember, so it was; I was thinking of that other stupid book, written by that woman they make such a fuss about, she who married the French emigrant.''_<br/>I dare say that I thought as you do at the time when the stupid Parisians were saying what a misalliance the widow of the famous General de Beauharnais was making by marrying the unknown Buonaparte.

_`` I suppose you mean Camilla?''_<br/>`` For you, I presume?''

_`` Yes, that's the book; such unnatural stuff!_<br/>`` But how cruel it is!

_An old man playing at see-saw, I took up the first volume once and looked it over, but I soon found it would not do; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before I saw it: as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant, I was sure I should never be able to get through it.''_<br/>So long as there was any question of the fall of man there was at least some sort of explanation of such phrases; but when it became certain that man had never fallen-- when with ever fuller knowledge we could trace our ancestral course down through the cave-man and the drift-man, back to that shadowy and far-off time when the man-like ape slowly evolved into the apelike man-- looking back on all this vast succession of life, we knew that it had always been rising from step to step.

_`` I have never read it.''_<br/>' I have not read it.'

_`` You had no loss, I assure you; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man's playing at see-saw and learning Latin; upon my soul there is not.''_<br/> I was amazed at the interest and knowledge which all these great people showed about the ring, for they not only had the deeds of the principal men of the time-- Belcher, Mendoza, Jackson, or Dutch Sam-- at their fingers' ends, but there was no fighting man so obscure that they did not know the details of his deeds and prospects.

_This critique, the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine, brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe's lodgings, and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son, as they met Mrs. Thorpe, who had descried them from above, in the passage._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_`` Ah, Mother!_<br/>Mother!''

_How do you do?''_<br/>How do?

_said he, giving her a hearty shake of the hand._<br/>he added, with a sudden smile upon his face.

_`` Where did you get that quiz of a hat?_<br/>Where did you get it, fellow?'

_It makes you look like an old witch._<br/>But you could do it, I'm thinking-- an old friend like you.''

_Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you, so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near.''_<br/>As I look back, one or two instances of that stand out so hard and clear in my recollection that they might be scenes which I had seen of late in the playhouse, instead of memories of my childhood more than threescore years ago, when the second Charles was on the throne.

_And this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother's heart, for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection._<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_On his two younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness, for he asked each of them how they did, and observed that they both looked very ugly._<br/>Her face was pale, striking rather than pretty, but with two great dark eyes, so earnestly questioning, so quick in their transitions from joy to pathos, so swift in their comment upon every word and deed around her, that those eyes alone were to many more attractive than all the beauty of her younger sister.

_These manners did not please Catherine; but he was James's friend and Isabella's brother; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella's assuring her, when they withdrew to see the new hat, that John thought her the most charming girl in the world, and by John's engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening._<br/>`` My name is Sawyer-- her's is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her-- and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he's at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops--'' `` Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,'' I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion;`` it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.''

_Had she been older or vainer, such attacks might have done little; but, where youth and diffidence are united, it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world, and of being so very early engaged as a partner; and the consequence was that, when the two Morlands, after sitting an hour with the Thorpes, set off to walk together to Mr. Allen's, and James, as the door was closed on them, said,`` Well, Catherine, how do you like my friend Thorpe?''_<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_instead of answering, as she probably would have done, had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case,`` I do not like him at all,'' she directly replied,`` I like him very much; he seems very agreeable.''_<br/>But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed.

_`` He is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived; a little of a rattle; but that will recommend him to your sex, I believe: and how do you like the rest of the family?''_<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_`` Very, very much indeed: Isabella particularly.''_<br/>`` Very likely, dear.''

_`` I am very glad to hear you say so; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to; she has so much good sense, and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable; I always wanted you to know her; and she seems very fond of you._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you, Catherine,'' taking her hand with affection,`` may be proud of.''_<br/>I hope, madam, by the King's generosity and goodness, and your intercession, I may hope for my life which if I have shall be ever employed in showing to your Majesty all the sense immaginable of gratitude, and in serving of the King like a true subject.

_`` Indeed I am,'' she replied;`` I love her exceedingly, and am delighted to find that you like her too._<br/>`` I am very pleased to hear you speak so sensibly, my dears.

_You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there.''_<br/>` You must not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.'

_`` Because I thought I should soon see you myself._<br/>`` I thought that I should probably hear from him soon, and I did.

_I hope you will be a great deal together while you are in Bath._<br/>I hope that you will find Norwood a pleasant residence.''

_She is a most amiable girl; such a superior understanding!_<br/>She was a charming companion, as well as a most assiduous doctor.

_How fond all the family are of her; she is evidently the general favourite; and how much she must be admired in such a place as this-- is not she?''_<br/>The lady is of excellent family and she is not wanting in personal charm.

_`` Yes, very much indeed, I fancy; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath.''_<br/>said I. `` Well, it bought him the prettiest wife in England, and that was some good that he got out of it.

_`` I dare say he does; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen._<br/>''` Nay, take it not to heart, bold Allen,' exclaimed their leader, who was none other than the great Jack Cade himself.

_I need not ask you whether you are happy here, my dear Catherine; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe, it would be impossible for you to be otherwise; and the Allens, I am sure, are very kind to you?''_<br/>You need not fear to tell me, dear, for you will find that I am worthy to be loved by such a soldier.

_`` Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever; how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see me.''_<br/>' I am glad to hear you say so,' I answered,` for it makes it easier for me to say that I wish to go my own way, and to have nothing more to do with you.

_James accepted this tribute of gratitude, and qualified his conscience for accepting it too, by saying with perfect sincerity,`` Indeed, Catherine, I love you dearly.''_<br/>`` You know,'' I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so much of Holmes's heart before,`` that it is my greatest joy and privilege to help you.''

_Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters, the situation of some, the growth of the rest, and other family matters now passed between them, and continued, with only one small digression on James's part, in praise of Miss Thorpe, till they reached Pulteney Street, where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen, invited by the former to dine with them, and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet._<br/>`` My name is Sawyer-- her's is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her-- and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he's at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops--'' `` Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,'' I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion;`` it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.''

_A pre-engagement in Edgar's Buildings prevented his accepting the invitation of one friend, and obliged him to hurry away as soon as he had satisfied the demands of the other._<br/>For my own part I was relieved at the explanation, for my father had left London in the full conviction that a vacancy would speedily be found for us both, and the one thing which had weighed upon my mind was that I might have found it hard to leave my uncle without interfering with the plans which he had formed.

_The time of the two parties uniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted, Catherine was then left to the luxury of a raised, restless, and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho, lost from all worldly concerns of dressing and dinner, incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen's fears on the delay of an expected dressmaker, and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even on the reflection of her own felicity, in being already engaged for the evening._<br/>There we left him then in the dim-lit London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman, while without, at the edge of the Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with it, his victory, which confined Napoleon's ambition for ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.

_CHAPTER 8  In spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker, however, the party from Pulteney Street reached the Upper Rooms in very good time._<br/>_-RSB-  THE END    THE GREAT KEINPLATZ EXPERIMENT  And Other Tales of Twilight and the Unseen  by  A.

_The Thorpes and James Morland were there only two minutes before them; and Isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste, of admiring the set of her gown, and envying the curl of her hair, they followed their chaperones, arm in arm, into the ballroom, whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred, and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection._<br/> He gave me the amused hand-shake and encouraging smile which the head master bestows upon the small boy, and, having greeted the others and helped to collect their bags and their cylinders of oxygen, he stowed us and them away in a large motor-car which was driven by the same impassive Austin, the man of few words, whom I had seen in the character of butler upon the occasion of my first eventful visit to the Professor.

_The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated; and James, who had been engaged quite as long as his sister, was very importunate with Isabella to stand up; but John was gone into the card-room to speak to a friend, and nothing, she declared, should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_`` I assure you,'' said she,`` I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening.''_<br/>Do not be satisfied with any evidence short of the best, but having got that, you can, it seems to me, wait for that short period when we shall all be re-united.

_Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude, and they continued as they were for three minutes longer, when Isabella, who had been talking to James on the other side of her, turned again to his sister and whispered,`` My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you, your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you will not mind my going away, and I dare say John will be back in a moment, and then you may easily find me out.''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Catherine, though a little disappointed, had too much good nature to make any opposition, and the others rising up, Isabella had only time to press her friend's hand and say,`` Good-bye, my dear love,'' before they hurried off._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing, Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom she now remained._<br/>'T is true that if La Jeune were dancing, or if Mrs. Bracegirdle or Mrs. Oldfield came upon the boards, we would hum and clap, but it was the fine woman that we applauded rather than the actress.'

_She could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr. Thorpe, for she not only longed to be dancing, but was likewise aware that, as the real dignity of her situation could not be known, she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_To be disgraced in the eye of the world, to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity, her actions all innocence, and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement, is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine's life, and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character._<br/>For though these poor peasants, in their dumb, blundering fashion, would have found it hard to give all their reasons in words, yet in the inmost heart of them they knew and felt that it was England's cause which they were fighting for, and that they were upholding their country's true self against those who would alter the old systems under which she had led the nations.

_Catherine had fortitude too; she suffered, but no murmur passed her lips._<br/>No, no,'' she continued, laughing, as she saw a look of dismay upon his face.

_From this state of humiliation, she was roused, at the end of ten minutes, to a pleasanter feeling, by seeing, not Mr. Thorpe, but Mr. Tilney, within three yards of the place where they sat; he seemed to be moving that way, but he did not see her, and therefore the smile and the blush, which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine, passed away without sullying her heroic importance._<br/> Terrified as they were by this sudden torrent of words, the two gentlewomen could not but smile at the sight of the fiery, domineering victim and the big apologetic representative of mankind who sat meekly bearing all the sins of his sex.

_He looked as handsome and as lively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing-looking young woman, who leant on his arm, and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister; thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever, by being married already._<br/>The name brought back instantly to him the remembrance of the sinister reputation of its owner-- a notorious buck of the thirties-- who had gambled and duelled and steeped himself in drink and debauchery, until even the vile set with whom he consorted had shrunk away from him in horror, and left him to a sinister old age with the barmaid wife whom he had married in some drunken frolic.

_But guided only by what was simple and probable, it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he had not behaved, he had not talked, like the married men to whom she had been used; he had never mentioned a wife, and he had acknowledged a sister._<br/>Although he had succeeded in learning from her lips that she was not indifferent to his suit, he had never dared to announce himself to her family as a formal suitor.

_From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister's now being by his side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen's bosom, Catherine sat erect, in the perfect use of her senses, and with cheeks only a little redder than usual._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_Mr. Tilney and his companion, who continued, though slowly, to approach, were immediately preceded by a lady, an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe; and this lady stopping to speak to her, they, as belonging to her, stopped likewise, and Catherine, catching Mr. Tilney's eye, instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_She returned it with pleasure, and then advancing still nearer, he spoke both to her and Mrs. Allen, by whom he was very civilly acknowledged._<br/>He lived rather nearer to the Squire's than she did, and was convinced that he could get there well before her.

_`` I am very happy to see you again, sir, indeed; I was afraid you had left Bath.''_<br/>`` I am as glad to see you as ever I was to see a man in my life, but I confess that I did not expect you.''

_He thanked her for her fears, and said that he had quitted it for a week, on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her._<br/>She felt suddenly that she was giving herself away, and she changed her face to a kindly, friendly smile, but it was too late, for I had had my warning.

_`` Well, sir, and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again, for it is just the place for young people-- and indeed for everybody else too._<br/>`` It's a play-actress,'' said I. `` Oh, you rude little boy, to say it in such a tone,'' said she;`` as if a play-actress was n't as good as any one else.

_I tell Mr. Allen, when he talks of being sick of it, that I am sure he should not complain, for it is so very agreeable a place, that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_I tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health.''_<br/>He used to ask me so often about my own health, and I thought him so fussy, for how could I tell what the meaning of it was?

_`` And I hope, madam, that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place, from finding it of service to him.''_<br/>`` In fact,'' said the Professor,`` I hope that she will now be induced to aid me in getting a wife.

_`` Thank you, sir._<br/>`` Thank you, sir.

_I have no doubt that he will._<br/>I have no doubt that you are quite right.

_A neighbour of ours, Dr. Skinner, was here for his health last winter, and came away quite stout.''_<br/>And that's Anthony Browne, who took a larynx out successfully last winter.

_`` That circumstance must give great encouragement.''_<br/>`` But you must give reasons.

_`` Yes, sir-- and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months; so I tell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away.''_<br/> I began to understand as I listened to him that my friends in England had not been so far wrong when they had declared that as long as he lived-- this little thirty-six year old artilleryman-- there could not possibly be any peace in the world.

_Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen, that she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney with seats, as they had agreed to join their party._<br/>` It has now come to pass, however, that Monmouth, who has long lived in dalliance with the Midianitish woman known by the name of Wentworth, has at last turned him to higher things, and has consented to make a bid for the crown.

_This was accordingly done, Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them; and after a few minutes' consideration, he asked Catherine to dance with him._<br/>So we stood throughout the evening, until, finding that they could get little sport from us, my Lord Clarendon, the Chancellor, gave us the word to retire, which we did at our leisure after saluting the King and the company.'

_This compliment, delightful as it was, produced severe mortification to the lady; and in giving her denial, she expressed her sorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it that had Thorpe, who joined her just afterwards, been half a minute earlier, he might have thought her sufferings rather too acute._<br/>Her voice was full of tears, and what she said was so simple, so true, that we both seemed to see the dead babe stretched there on the carpet before us, and we could have joined in with words of pity and of grief.

_The very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more to her lot; nor did the particulars which he entered into while they were standing up, of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just left, and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them, interest her so much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney._<br/>I took the precaution of walking the horse very quietly until we were some distance from the house, for I had told Reuben nothing of my intended journey, and I was convinced that if he knew of it neither discipline, nor even his new ties of love, would prevent him from coming with me.

_Of her dear Isabella, to whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman, she could see nothing._<br/>His fair daughter Sophie looked at me also, but she said nothing, and I could read her tender pity in her dark eyes.

_They were in different sets._<br/>Our conditions are different.''

_She was separated from all her party, and away from all her acquaintance; one mortification succeeded another, and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson, that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady._<br/>The less experienced a doctor is, the higher are his notions of professional dignity, as I need not remind you, my young friend, so I was about to refuse the commission with indignation, when I bethought me that, quite apart from medicine, we were gentleman and lady, and that she had asked me to do something for her which was evidently of the greatest possible importance in her eyes.

_From such a moralizing strain as this, she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder, and turning round, perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her, attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman._<br/>It was agony to him to hear that she was about to straighten little Alec Turner's club-foot, and right at the fringe of the rumour came a note from his mother, the rector's wife, asking him if he would be so good as to act as chloroformist.

_`` I beg your pardon, Miss Morland,'' said she,`` for this liberty-- but I can not anyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you.''_<br/>she cried,`` and asking your pardon for troubling you, but I'm feared o' the young leddy, sir; she is not in her room.''

_Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine._<br/>Again, if Miss Julia Ames can tell Mr. Stead things in her own earth life of which he could not have cognisance, and if those things are shown, when tested, to be true, then one is more inclined to think that those things which can not be tested are true also.

_The young ladies were introduced to each other, Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness, Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation; and Mrs. Hughes, satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge, returned to her party._<br/>`` Come, come, my dear lady,'' said he,`` you speak vastly beyond my merits;'' upon which encouragement she started again in a theatrical apostrophe to Britain's darling and Neptune's eldest son, which he endured with the same signs of gratitude and pleasure.

_Miss Tilney had a good figure, a pretty face, and a very agreeable countenance; and her air, though it had not all the decided pretension, the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe's, had more real elegance._<br/>`` The fact is, my dear Belmont-- I'm sure you would not let it go further-- above all not to the ladies; but I am rather older than I used to be, and rather than lose the military carriage which has always been dear to me, I--'' `` Stays, be Jove!''

_Her manners showed good sense and good breeding; they were neither shy nor affectedly open; and she seemed capable of being young, attractive, and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her, and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence._<br/>He had not yet attained his full six foot of stature, but no judge of a man-LRB- and every woman, at least, is one-RRB- could look at his perfect shoulders, his narrow loins, and his proud head that sat upon his neck like an eagle upon its perch, without feeling that sober joy which all that is beautiful in Nature gives to us-- a vague self- content, as though in some way we also had a hand in the making of it.

_Catherine, interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirous of being acquainted with her, and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say, and had courage and leisure for saying it._<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy, by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites, prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance, by informing themselves how well the other liked Bath, how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country, whether she drew, or played, or sang, and whether she was fond of riding on horseback._<br/>Beyond sighting a Barbary rover once, whereat our mariners were in sad distress, counting themselves already as little better than slaves, we had good luck until we had come within a hundred leagues of the Cape of Good Hope, when the wind veered round to the southward and blew exceeding hard, while the sea rose to such a height that the end of the mainyard dipped into the water, and I heard the master say that though he had been at sea for five-and-thirty years he had never seen the like of it, and that he had little expectation of riding through it.

_The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful Isabella, who in great spirits exclaimed,`` At last I have got you._<br/> Having got so far, Defoe remarked that he thought he had given them a fair start, and handed over the story to Dean Swift, who, after premising that he feared he would find himself as much at sea as Master Cyprian Overbeck Wells, continued in this way:-- `` For two days I drifted about in great distress, fearing that there should be a return of the gale, and keeping an eager look-out for my late companions.

_My dearest creature, I have been looking for you this hour._<br/>Ah, my friends, the hour of my triumph had come!

_What could induce you to come into this set, when you knew I was in the other?_<br/>What would happen if I were to make the same claim?

_I have been quite wretched without you.''_<br/>I have been very selfish and thoughtless.''

_`` My dear Isabella, how was it possible for me to get at you?_<br/>`` My dear fellow, what does it matter to me.

_I could not even see where you were.''_<br/>I could not believe it.

_`` So I told your brother all the time-- but he would not believe me._<br/>' I do not ask it in my father's name, but in my own.

_Do go and see for her, Mr. Morland, said I-- but all in vain-- he would not stir an inch._<br/>I have, as I said, done Mortimer some turns which he might remember, though it did not become me to remind him of them.

_Was not it so, Mr. Morland?_<br/>That would not do, Charles!

_But you men are all so immoderately lazy!_<br/>` Why, man, you are mad!

_I have been scolding him to such a degree, my dear Catherine, you would be quite amazed._<br/>I have been able to do so much for him that he has become my very good friend, so that I may ask him what I like in return.

_You know I never stand upon ceremony with such people.''_<br/>I trust that you will never put yourself into the way of having such another.''

_`` Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head,'' whispered Catherine, detaching her friend from James._<br/>` Weary again, daddy, weary again,' she said, shaking her head anxiously, with a small white hand upon each of his shoulders.

_`` It is Mr. Tilney's sister.''_<br/>He is Mrs. Westmacott's brother.''

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Heavens!_<br/>Heavens!

_You do n't say so!_<br/>Please do n't!''

_Let me look at her this moment._<br/>Now look at this.''

_What a delightful girl!_<br/>`` What a vulgar-looking woman!''

_I never saw anything half so beautiful!_<br/>`` I never saw any one like you.

_But where is her all-conquering brother?_<br/>But where is your uncle?''

_Is he in the room?_<br/>How came he into the room?''

_Point him out to me this instant, if he is._<br/>Tell me this instant what it is.''

_I die to see him._<br/>`` How did he die?''

_Mr. Morland, you are not to listen._<br/>It is a subject upon which he will not listen to argument.

_We are not talking about you.''_<br/>`` I do n't understand what they are talking about.''

_`` But what is all this whispering about?_<br/>` But how comes this about?'

_What is going on?''_<br/>What is this?

_`` There now, I knew how it would be._<br/>`` I knew it would come out, I felt that it would.

_You men have such restless curiosity!_<br/>He has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless.''

_Talk of the curiosity of women, indeed!_<br/>Whatever would the women think of him!

_'T is nothing._<br/>It is nothing.

_But be satisfied, for you are not to know anything at all of the matter.''_<br/>But if it be for you, then it can not be from any one of much importance.''

_`` And is that likely to satisfy me, do you think?''_<br/>`` But what do you mean to do?''

_`` Well, I declare I never knew anything like you._<br/>`` But you never had any real cause?''

_What can it signify to you, what we are talking of._<br/>`` What were we talking about?''

_Perhaps we are talking about you; therefore I would advise you not to listen, or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable.''_<br/>Now one thing I have to say to you, and I speak it that all may hear, and that none may hereafter complain that the rules he serves under were not made clear to him.

_In this commonplace chatter, which lasted some time, the original subject seemed entirely forgotten; and though Catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while, she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella's impatient desire to see Mr. Tilney._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance, James would have led his fair partner away, but she resisted._<br/>It was called, as I remember,`` The Briton Conquers but to Save,'' and he rolled it out in a very fair bass voice, the others joining in the chorus, and clapping vigorously when he finished.

_`` I tell you, Mr. Morland,'' she cried,`` I would not do such a thing for all the world._<br/>If only Mr. Brown and Mr. Headingly were with us, then I should not have one care in the world,'' cried Sadie.

_How can you be so teasing; only conceive, my dear Catherine, what your brother wants me to do._<br/>Of him I shall have more to say hereafter; but you will note now that he was my own uncle, and brother to my mother.

_He wants me to dance with him again, though I tell him that it is a most improper thing, and entirely against the rules._<br/>It is a sorry thing for a man's mind to have nothing higher to dwell upon than the turning of a compliment or the dancing of a corranto.

_It would make us the talk of the place, if we were not to change partners.''_<br/>If we had not got in when we did, you would not be here to tell the tale.

_`` Upon my honour,'' said James,`` in these public assemblies, it is as often done as not.''_<br/>`` Come in, Sir Charles, and I am convinced that you will acknowledge that I could not have done otherwise.

_`` Nonsense, how can you say so?_<br/>`` Oh, you say that, do you?''

_But when you men have a point to carry, you never stick at anything._<br/>He is a man who is always in a hurry, and yet has never anything to do.

_My sweet Catherine, do support me; persuade your brother how impossible it is._<br/>Oh, do help me, like a good, dear, kind papa, in this matter, for my whole heart is set upon it.

_Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing; now would not it?''_<br/>He would not resent it so much if he had not something to fear from it.

_`` No, not at all; but if you think it wrong, you had much better change.''_<br/>`` No, it's not quite so bad as that.

_`` There,'' cried Isabella,`` you hear what your sister says, and yet you will not mind her._<br/>`` My dear Mrs. Westmacott,'' cried Clara,`` I assure you that I have not the least idea what it is that you are talking of.''

_Well, remember that it is not my fault, if we set all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle._<br/>`` If it were not for our great ancestors and for our beloved country, the Queen of the Waters,'' said he,`` I could find it in my heart to be glad at this destruction which has come upon this vain and feeble generation.

_Come along, my dearest Catherine, for heaven's sake, and stand by me.''_<br/>Oh, do help me, like a good, dear, kind papa, in this matter, for my whole heart is set upon it.

_And off they went, to regain their former place._<br/>I did it, and came to your post in my return.

_John Thorpe, in the meanwhile, had walked away; and Catherine, ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once, made her way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could, in the hope of finding him still with them-- a hope which, when it proved to be fruitless, she felt to have been highly unreasonable._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_`` Well, my dear,'' said Mrs. Thorpe, impatient for praise of her son,`` I hope you have had an agreeable partner.''_<br/>Mrs. Harrison loved Jim as if he had been her own son, and her husband loved mine, so they came to my help, and may God bless them for their kindness to a distracted wife and mother!

_`` Very agreeable, madam.''_<br/>`` Very good, sir.''

_`` I am glad of it._<br/>`` I am glad of that.''

_John has charming spirits, has not he?''_<br/>Gad's wounds, are they not beautiful?

_`` Did you meet Mr. Tilney, my dear?''_<br/>`` Did you speak, sir?''

_said Mrs. Allen._<br/>asked Mrs. Adams.

_`` No, where is he?''_<br/>`` No, he's not.''

_`` He was with us just now, and said he was so tired of lounging about, that he was resolved to go and dance; so I thought perhaps he would ask you, if he met with you.''_<br/>`` I was so afraid that he might get upon the drink that I made him promise to go straight to you, sir, the very instant he should arrive.

_`` Where can he be?''_<br/>`` Who can he be?''

_said Catherine, looking round; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance._<br/>She saw her face as the glass reflected it, but she did not see the changing play of expression which gave it its charm-- the infinite pity, the sympathy, the sweet womanliness which drew towards her all who were in doubt and in trouble, even as poor slow-moving Charles Westmacott had been drawn to her that night.

_`` Ah!_<br/>`` Ah!

_He has got a partner; I wish he had asked you,'' said Mrs. Allen; and after a short silence, she added,`` he is a very agreeable young man.''_<br/> My mother seemed to speak with a hushed voice when she mentioned this wonderful brother of hers, and always had done as long as I can remember, so that I had learned also to have a subdued and reverent feeling when I heard his name.

_`` Indeed he is, Mrs. Allen,'' said Mrs. Thorpe, smiling complacently;`` I must say it, though I am his mother, that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world.''_<br/>` It is your first entrance at Court, is it not, Monsieur de Laval,' said he, in his high-bred cordial manner;` you should not feel lonely, for there are certainly many friends of your father here who will be overjoyed to make the acquaintance of your father's son.

_This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen, for after only a moment's consideration, she said, in a whisper to Catherine,`` I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son.''_<br/>`` My first explanations I owe to you, Sir Charles,'' said Jim; and as I listened to his voice and noted his manner, I could not but admire the effect which the company of her whom he now knew to be his mother had had upon a rude country lad.

_Catherine was disappointed and vexed._<br/> Doctor Walker looked disappointed.

_She seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view; and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply, when John Thorpe came up to her soon afterwards and said,`` Well, Miss Morland, I suppose you and I are to stand up and jig it together again.''_<br/>She saw her face as the glass reflected it, but she did not see the changing play of expression which gave it its charm-- the infinite pity, the sympathy, the sweet womanliness which drew towards her all who were in doubt and in trouble, even as poor slow-moving Charles Westmacott had been drawn to her that night.

_`` Oh, no; I am much obliged to you, our two dances are over; and, besides, I am tired, and do not mean to dance any more.''_<br/>`` Well,'' said she, laughing like one who is hurt,`` you have no cause to say anything, for I read on your face what you have been taught to think of me.

_`` Do not you?_<br/>`` Why should you not?''

_Then let us walk about and quiz people._<br/>Let us walk,'' said he.

_Come along with me, and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my two younger sisters and their partners._<br/>In the room above was the fourth sister, a remarkably beautiful girl in evident need of my assistance.

_I have been laughing at them this half hour.''_<br/>You have been frowning and smiling like an April day.'

_Again Catherine excused herself; and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself._<br/> They walked on together side by side, she brooding over some thought of her own, and he a little crossed and disappointed at her caprice and the lost commission for Harold.

_The rest of the evening she found very dull; Mr. Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea, to attend that of his partner; Miss Tilney, though belonging to it, did not sit near her, and James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile, one squeeze, and one`` dearest Catherine.''_<br/>He had certainly a strange audience to harangue: his wife perfectly acquiescent and absolutely ignorant of his meaning, Summerlee seated in the shadow, querulous and critical but interested, Lord John lounging in a corner somewhat bored by the whole proceeding, and myself beside the window watching the scene with a kind of detached attention, as if it were all a dream or something in which I had no personal interest whatever.

_CHAPTER 9  The progress of Catherine's unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows._<br/> It was between eight and nine o'clock now, and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night.

_It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her, while she remained in the rooms, which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home._<br/>My fellow-lodger had kept her room; and, steeled as my mind was against her influence, I was yet conscious of a little throb of disappointment that she should allow me to depart without a word of farewell.

_This, on arriving in Pulteney Street, took the direction of extraordinary hunger, and when that was appeased, changed into an earnest longing to be in bed; such was the extreme point of her distress; for when there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours, and from which she awoke perfectly revived, in excellent spirits, with fresh hopes and fresh schemes._<br/>There we left him then in the dim-lit London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman, while without, at the edge of the Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with it, his victory, which confined Napoleon's ambition for ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.

_The first wish of her heart was to improve her acquaintance with Miss Tilney, and almost her first resolution, to seek her for that purpose, in the pump-room at noon._<br/>As I was racking my brain as to how I should best describe it, my eyes fell upon the issue of my own Journal for the morning of the 8th of November with the full and excellent account of my friend and fellow-reporter Macdona.

_In the pump-room, one so newly arrived in Bath must be met with, and that building she had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence, and the completion of female intimacy, so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited confidence, that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_Her plan for the morning thus settled, she sat quietly down to her book after breakfast, resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one; and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen, whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such, that as she never talked a great deal, so she could never be entirely silent; and, therefore, while she sat at her work, if she lost her needle or broke her thread, if she heard a carriage in the street, or saw a speck upon her gown, she must observe it aloud, whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_At about half past twelve, a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window, and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door, in the first only a servant, her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second, before John Thorpe came running upstairs, calling out,`` Well, Miss Morland, here I am._<br/>There we left him then in the dim-lit London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman, while without, at the edge of the Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with it, his victory, which confined Napoleon's ambition for ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.

_Have you been waiting long?_<br/>`` Have you been there?''

_We could not come before; the old devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into, and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street._<br/>I was not clear that these professions could be made to agree with the speech in which Kenna had promised a hundred hides of land to every man on the ship; but on my making this remark, the three chiefs seemed very surprised and hurt by my suspicions, and explained very plausibly that, as the Britons needed them as a guard, they could not aid them better than by settling on the soil, and so being continually at hand in order to help them.

_How do you do, Mrs. Allen?_<br/>How do, George?''

_A famous ball last night, was not it?_<br/>Surely one night was not too much to ask.

_Come, Miss Morland, be quick, for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off._<br/>But, as Miss Morstan remarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through without delay.''

_They want to get their tumble over.''_<br/>They will serve to break the force of the attack.

_`` What do you mean?''_<br/>`` What do you mean?''

_said Catherine._<br/>said Mary.

_`` Where are you all going to?''_<br/>Where are you off to now?''

_`` Going to?_<br/>`` Where to?''

_Why, you have not forgot our engagement!_<br/>`` Why should we not have a chat?''

_Did not we agree together to take a drive this morning?_<br/>Did it not prove me to be in the right?'

_What a head you have!_<br/>What have you yourself now?''

_We are going up Claverton Down.''_<br/>Well, we are well down Channel now.

_`` Something was said about it, I remember,'' said Catherine, looking at Mrs. Allen for her opinion;`` but really I did not expect you.''_<br/> I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.

_`` Not expect me!_<br/>`` Not I!''

_That's a good one!_<br/>That's good enough for me.

_And what a dust you would have made, if I had not come.''_<br/>And yet the day may come when I would not have it otherwise.

_Catherine's silent appeal to her friend, meanwhile, was entirely thrown away, for Mrs. Allen, not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look, was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else; and Catherine, whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive, and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe, as Isabella was going at the same time with James, was therefore obliged to speak plainer._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_`` Well, ma'am, what do you say to it?_<br/>Well, what do you make of that?''

_Can you spare me for an hour or two?_<br/>Do you recall the hour?''

_Shall I go?''_<br/>Shall I stop?

_`` Do just as you please, my dear,'' replied Mrs. Allen, with the most placid indifference._<br/>`` But, my dear Mrs. Smith,'' said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders,`` You are frightening yourself about nothing.

_Catherine took the advice, and ran off to get ready._<br/>and taking to my heels I ran for home at the top of my speed.

_In a very few minutes she reappeared, having scarcely allowed the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her praise, after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen's admiration of his gig; and then receiving her friend's parting good wishes, they both hurried downstairs._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` My dearest creature,'' cried Isabella, to whom the duty of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the carriage,`` you have been at least three hours getting ready._<br/>He was married to the second daughter of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir Lothian's descendants have their eye upon the property, they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them.

_I was afraid you were ill._<br/>I'm afraid I ca n't get it off.

_What a delightful ball we had last night._<br/>I had an extraordinary experience with it last night.

_I have a thousand things to say to you; but make haste and get in, for I long to be off.''_<br/>I have but seen them this once in ten years, and it may be ten more, for all I know, ere I see them again.

_Catherine followed her orders and turned away, but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to James,`` What a sweet girl she is!_<br/>`` My first explanations I owe to you, Sir Charles,'' said Jim; and as I listened to his voice and noted his manner, I could not but admire the effect which the company of her whom he now knew to be his mother had had upon a rude country lad.

_I quite dote on her.''_<br/>You also loved her.

_`` You will not be frightened, Miss Morland,'' said Thorpe, as he handed her in,`` if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off._<br/>`` I should stay to keep her company, Mr. Belmont,'' said the little American old maid;`` but I learn that Mrs. Shlesinger finds the ride too long for her, and has some letters which she must mail to-day, so Mrs. Belmont will not be lonesome.''

_He will, most likely, give a plunge or two, and perhaps take the rest for a minute; but he will soon know his master._<br/>It would be kind of you, though, if you would look in at number one when you get back and tell my wife that all's well with me, and that I'll be back in an hour or so.''

_He is full of spirits, playful as can be, but there is no vice in him.''_<br/>He, on his part, showed me no ill-will, but met me rather with a coarse joviality, and a rough familiarity which he meant to be ingratiating.

_Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one, but it was too late to retreat, and she was too young to own herself frightened; so, resigning herself to her fate, and trusting to the animal's boasted knowledge of its owner, she sat peaceably down, and saw Thorpe sit down by her._<br/> Terrified as they were by this sudden torrent of words, the two gentlewomen could not but smile at the sight of the fiery, domineering victim and the big apologetic representative of mankind who sat meekly bearing all the sins of his sex.

_Everything being then arranged, the servant who stood at the horse's head was bid in an important voice`` to let him go,'' and off they went in the quietest manner imaginable, without a plunge or a caper, or anything like one._<br/>I took the precaution of walking the horse very quietly until we were some distance from the house, for I had told Reuben nothing of my intended journey, and I was convinced that if he knew of it neither discipline, nor even his new ties of love, would prevent him from coming with me.

_Catherine, delighted at so happy an escape, spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise; and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins, and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip._<br/> When I looked at this splendid fellow, with his high-bred, clean-cut face, and thought of the fine qualities and gentle, generous impulses which I knew to lie within him, it seemed so absurd that he should speak as though my friendship towards him were a condescension, that I could not help laughing aloud.

_Catherine, though she could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse, he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks, congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner, without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity, and-LRB- considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour-RRB- by no means alarmingly fast, gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind, in a fine mild day of February, with the consciousness of safety._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_A silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue; it was broken by Thorpe's saying very abruptly,`` Old Allen is as rich as a Jew-- is not he?''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Catherine did not understand him-- and he repeated his question, adding in explanation,`` Old Allen, the man you are with.''_<br/>He's not the same man he used to be, though I make free to say that he was never quite one of my gentlemen, like Mr. Hastie or yourself, sir.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Mr. Allen, you mean._<br/>Mark that, Watson.

_Yes, I believe, he is very rich.''_<br/>`` Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough!

_`` And no children at all?''_<br/>`` No, no, not at all.

_`` No-- not any.''_<br/>`` No-- certainly not.''

_`` A famous thing for his next heirs._<br/>` What is the name of your great-uncle?'

_He is your godfather, is not he?''_<br/>That is one, is it not?''

_`` My godfather!_<br/>`` My brothers!''

_No.''_<br/>No!

_`` But you are always very much with them.''_<br/>`` I like him very much indeed.

_`` Yes, very much.''_<br/>`` Yes, quite recently.''

_`` Aye, that is what I meant._<br/>`` Aye, it's just him that I do mean.

_He seems a good kind of old fellow enough, and has lived very well in his time, I dare say; he is not gouty for nothing._<br/>We were of an age, he a few years perhaps my senior, but our tastes, our judgments, and our characters were alike, save only that he had in him a touch of pride such as I have never known in any other man.

_Does he drink his bottle a day now?''_<br/>I suppose you think this is drink.''

_`` His bottle a day!_<br/>`` A month!

_No._<br/>No!

_Why should you think of such a thing?_<br/>Why do you do this thing?''

_He is a very temperate man, and you could not fancy him in liquor last night?''_<br/>The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober.

_`` Lord help you!_<br/>`` God help me!

_You women are always thinking of men's being in liquor._<br/>`` It is women like you who brace men up.

_Why, you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle?_<br/>He is not a man to flinch from his liquor, I'll warrant.

_I am sure of this-- that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day, there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now._<br/>`` I'm not quite clear in my own mind how these things should be approached,-- if they are to be approached at all,-- but I am sure this is not the way.

_It would be a famous good thing for us all.''_<br/>I wish it to be a great success.

_`` I can not believe it.''_<br/>`` I can not help it.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Lord, it would be the saving of thousands._<br/>where would the hundreds of millions be which have been invested in this country?

_There is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be._<br/>It is not too much to say that it will rank level with my own when the final credit of this business comes to be apportioned.

_Our foggy climate wants help.''_<br/>Mark whose face is gloomy and whose content.

_`` And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford.''_<br/>' I have heard,' said Saxon,` that much beer and cider, with wine and strong waters, have found their way into their camp.

_`` Oxford!_<br/>`` Cambridge.''

_There is no drinking at Oxford now, I assure you._<br/>There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you that it is so.

_Nobody drinks there._<br/>It's not drink.

_You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost._<br/>What sort of a man could he be who during thirty years of his life had never made a single friend, high or low, who cared to continue to keep in touch with him?

_Now, for instance, it was reckoned a remarkable thing, at the last party in my rooms, that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head._<br/>Tom would only admit about a dozen of the more influential of the townspeople into the room, but issued bulletins out of the window every five minutes to the crowd below.

_It was looked upon as something out of the common way._<br/>That was the end of the matter so far as I was concerned.''

_Mine is famous good stuff, to be sure._<br/>Well, you are fine, to be sure!''

_You would not often meet with anything like it in Oxford-- and that may account for it._<br/>` You must not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.'

_But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there.''_<br/>I do hope you will have a good drink before you leave the wells.

_`` Yes, it does give a notion,'' said Catherine warmly,`` and that is, that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did._<br/> So pleased was I at these sensible remarks on the part of the strangers, that I was right glad to have the opportunity of making their closer acquaintance over a flask of excellent wine.

_However, I am sure James does not drink so much.''_<br/>But now I am really a dead man, so it does not matter very much what I say.''

_This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply, of which no part was very distinct, except the frequent exclamations, amounting almost to oaths, which adorned it, and Catherine was left, when it ended, with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford, and the same happy conviction of her brother's comparative sobriety._<br/>`` My name is Sawyer-- her's is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her-- and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he's at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops--'' `` Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,'' I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion;`` it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.''

_Thorpe's ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage, and she was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse moved along, and the ease which his paces, as well as the excellence of the springs, gave the motion of the carriage._<br/>` With all humbleness, your Majesty,' said Lord Grey, who had just returned with the horse,' I should suggest, since there are only a few troops of their cavalry on this side of the Avon, that we blow up the bridge and move onwards to Bath, whence we can pass into Wiltshire, which we know to be friendly.'

_She followed him in all his admiration as well as she could._<br/>She began to praise you, I said what I felt, and then in an instant it was all out.''

_To go before or beyond him was impossible._<br/>It was impossible, then.

_His knowledge and her ignorance of the subject, his rapidity of expression, and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power; she could strike out nothing new in commendation, but she readily echoed whatever he chose to assert, and it was finally settled between them without any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the most complete of its kind in England, his carriage the neatest, his horse the best goer, and himself the best coachman._<br/>In his great goodness and self-abnegation he had, in his early declaration given forth at Lyme, declared that he should leave the choice of a monarch to the Commons of England, but having found that his enemies did most scandalously and basely make use of this his self-denial, and did assert that he had so little confidence in his own cause that he dared not take publicly the title which is due to him, he hath determined that this should have an end.

_`` You do not really think, Mr. Thorpe,'' said Catherine, venturing after some time to consider the matter as entirely decided, and to offer some little variation on the subject,`` that James's gig will break down?''_<br/>It was agreed that I should write home full accounts of my adventures in the shape of successive letters to McArdle, and that these should either be edited for the Gazette as they arrived, or held back to be published later, according to the wishes of Professor Challenger, since we could not yet know what conditions he might attach to those directions which should guide us to the unknown land.

_`` Break down!_<br/>`` Come down!''

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_Lord!_<br/>Good Lord!

_Did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life?_<br/>`` Did ever you witness anything more masterly?''

_There is not a sound piece of iron about it._<br/>There is not a tittle of evidence for this.

_The wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least-- and as for the body!_<br/>I have but seen them this once in ten years, and it may be ten more, for all I know, ere I see them again.

_Upon my soul, you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch._<br/>A sudden hope sprang up in my soul that I might be in time to intercept him.

_It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld!_<br/>It is a very queer place,-- the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners, too.

_Thank God!_<br/>`` Thank God!

_we have got a better._<br/>I know better now.''

_I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds.''_<br/>You would n't think the mares had come fifty miles, would you?

_`` Good heavens!''_<br/>`` Good heavens!''

_cried Catherine, quite frightened._<br/>she cried, with pretty wonder.

_`` Then pray let us turn back; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on._<br/>Now, if you will kindly turn round, I will explain, also, what we see upon the other side.''

_Do let us turn back, Mr. Thorpe; stop and speak to my brother, and tell him how very unsafe it is.''_<br/>It is as well, for I have already made up my mind that my duty to you, my son, outweighs that which I owe, and have at such bitter cost fulfilled, to my brother and my family.''

_`` Unsafe!_<br/>` Shameful!'

_Oh, lord!_<br/>`` Oh, Lord!''

_What is there in that?_<br/>`` What is that?''

_They will only get a roll if it does break down; and there is plenty of dirt; it will be excellent falling._<br/>And then they know that nothing is so catching as shyness, and that if they do not keep a face of stone, their patient will be covered with confusion.

_Oh, curse it!_<br/>` Oh, what a misfortune!

_The carriage is safe enough, if a man knows how to drive it; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out._<br/>Though it is now eight- and-forty years ago, it is clearer to me than the doings of last week, for the memory of an old man is like one of those glasses which shows out what is at a distance and blurs all that is near.

_Lord bless you!_<br/>God bless you!''

_I would undertake for five pounds to drive it to York and back again, without losing a nail.''_<br/>I would give the state of the barometer, but that unlucky instrument had experienced an unprecedented fall of forty-two inches-- from a nail to the ground-- and was not in a reliable condition.

_Catherine listened with astonishment; she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing; for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle, nor to know to how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead._<br/> So stunned and shaken was I by the sudden fall, that though I had a dim knowledge of shadowy figures bending over me, and of hoarse laughter sounding in my ears, I could not tell for a few minutes where I was nor what had befallen me.

_Her own family were plain, matter-of-fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind; her father, at the utmost, being contented with a pun, and her mother with a proverb; they were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase their importance, or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict the next._<br/>The lady came, not altogether with the approval of her husband, and though she never gave indications of any very great psychic force, we were able, at least, to obtain those usual phenomena of message-tilting which are at the same time so puerile and so inexplicable.

_She reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity, and was more than once on the point of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject; but she checked herself, because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights, in making those things plain which he had before made ambiguous; and, joining to this, the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preserve them, she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe, and therefore would alarm herself no longer._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_By him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten; and all the rest of his conversation, or rather talk, began and ended with himself and his own concerns._<br/>He much regretted that any personal bias should have been read into his remarks, which were entirely dictated by his desire for scientific truth.

_He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle and sold for incredible sums; of racing matches, in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winner; of shooting parties, in which he had killed more birds-LRB- though without having one good shot-RRB- than all his companions together; and described to her some famous day's sport, with the fox-hounds, in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman, and in which the boldness of his riding, though it had never endangered his own life for a moment, had been constantly leading others into difficulties, which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself, and unfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be, she could not entirely repress a doubt, while she bore with the effusions of his endless conceit, of his being altogether completely agreeable._<br/> Reuben had said not a word since she had uncovered her face, and bore the face of a man who finds himself in some pleasant dream and is vexed only by the fear lest he wake up from it.

_It was a bold surmise, for he was Isabella's brother; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex; but in spite of this, the extreme weariness of his company, which crept over her before they had been out an hour, and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again, induced her, in some small degree, to resist such high authority, and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_When they arrived at Mrs. Allen's door, the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed, on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house:`` Past three o'clock!''_<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_It was inconceivable, incredible, impossible!_<br/>It was impossible, then.

_And she would neither believe her own watch, nor her brother's, nor the servant's; she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality, till Morland produced his watch, and ascertained the fact; to have doubted a moment longer then would have been equally inconceivable, incredible, and impossible; and she could only protest, over and over again, that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before, as Catherine was called on to confirm; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella; but the latter was spared the misery of her friend's dissenting voice, by not waiting for her answer._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Her own feelings entirely engrossed her; her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home._<br/>He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.

_It was ages since she had had a moment's conversation with her dearest Catherine; and, though she had such thousands of things to say to her, it appeared as if they were never to be together again; so, with smiles of most exquisite misery, and the laughing eye of utter despondency, she bade her friend adieu and went on._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning, and was immediately greeted with,`` Well, my dear, here you are,'' a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute;`` and I hope you have had a pleasant airing?''_<br/> She raised no objection, and for my part I was overjoyed at the proposal, as it gave me an opportunity of learning more of this singular cousin of mine, who had told me so much and yet seemed to know so much more.

_`` Yes, ma'am, I thank you; we could not have had a nicer day.''_<br/>`` I could not wish a better one.''

_`` So Mrs. Thorpe said; she was vastly pleased at your all going.''_<br/>`` Commonplace,'' said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration.

_`` You have seen Mrs. Thorpe, then?''_<br/>`` You have seen him, then?''

_`` Yes, I went to the pump-room as soon as you were gone, and there I met her, and we had a great deal of talk together._<br/>`` He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,'' she answered,`` he's awful fond of me.

_She says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning, it is so uncommonly scarce.''_<br/>I have never yet encountered any problem, however, which my inventive brain was unable to solve, and I promise you that to-morrow I will turn my attention to the question of our descent.''

_`` Did you see anybody else of our acquaintance?''_<br/>` Did you meet anyone there?'

_`` Yes; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent, and there we met Mrs. Hughes, and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her.''_<br/>`` Well, I like the English tailor-made dresses well enough for walking, Mr. Stephens,'' said Miss Sadie from behind them.

_`` Did you indeed?_<br/>`` Did you?

_And did they speak to you?''_<br/>What do you say to that?''

_`` Yes, we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour._<br/>`` Yes, I was there, and lingered for a quarter of an hour or so.

_They seem very agreeable people._<br/>`` It was extremely good of you.''

_Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin, and I fancy, by what I can learn, that she always dresses very handsomely._<br/>`` Mrs. Belmont, you look just too perfectly sweet anyhow, but if you'll allow me, I'll fix your dress for you.''

_Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family.''_<br/>However, I could talk to my father, who knows a very great deal of the world.''

_`` And what did she tell you of them?''_<br/>`` I tell you that I saw her do it.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_A vast deal indeed; she hardly talked of anything else.''_<br/>In a fairly large experience I have never known any one to do so in real life.

_`` Did she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from?''_<br/>'' _ Re _ Abousir,'' she read;`` now, what _ do _ you mean by' _ re _,' Mr. Stephens?

_`` Yes, she did; but I can not recollect now._<br/>`` She did not think so.

_But they are very good kind of people, and very rich._<br/>`` It was extremely good of you.''

_Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond, and she and Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows; and Miss Drummond had a very large fortune; and, when she married, her father gave her twenty thousand pounds, and five hundred to buy wedding-clothes._<br/>It still bore the splotches of the tears which she had dropped on it, poor soul, and ran in this wise:-- ` Instructions from Mistress Mary Clarke to her son Micah, on the twelfth day of June in the year of our Lord sixteen hundred and eighty-five.

_Mrs. Hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse.''_<br/>Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told us that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards opened the window.

_`` And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath?''_<br/>`` Is Mr. Smith or Mr. Hanbury in?''

_`` Yes, I fancy they are, but I am not quite certain._<br/>`` Because I am not sure.

_Upon recollection, however, I have a notion they are both dead; at least the mother is; yes, I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead, because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding-day and that Miss Tilney has got now, for they were put by for her when her mother died.''_<br/>He was married to the second daughter of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir Lothian's descendants have their eye upon the property, they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them.

_`` And is Mr. Tilney, my partner, the only son?''_<br/>`` This is my only son, sir,'' said my father.

_`` I can not be quite positive about that, my dear; I have some idea he is; but, however, he is a very fine young man, Mrs. Hughes says, and likely to do very well.''_<br/>` You are certainly a very modest young man, and I hope you will not lose that charming quality when you have been for a little time at my Court.

_Catherine inquired no further; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give, and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister._<br/> She raised no objection, and for my part I was overjoyed at the proposal, as it gave me an opportunity of learning more of this singular cousin of mine, who had told me so much and yet seemed to know so much more.

_Could she have foreseen such a circumstance, nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others; and, as it was, she could only lament her ill luck, and think over what she had lost, till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been very pleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable._<br/>They were never at their ease, always upon the brink of a catastrophe, encouraged one day only to be rudely rebuffed the next, bullied in public and slighted in private, and yet, in spite of it all, the singular fact remains that they loved him and served him as no monarch has been loved and served.

_CHAPTER 10  The Allens, Thorpes, and Morlands all met in the evening at the theatre; and, as Catherine and Isabella sat together, there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided them._<br/> The Empress had graciously offered me a seat in her berline, and all the way to the village, entirely forgetful apparently of the scene through which she passed, she chatted away, asking me a thousand personal questions about myself and my affairs, for a kindly curiosity in the doings of everyone around her was one of her most marked characteristics.

_`` Oh, heavens!_<br/>`` Good heavens!''

_My beloved Catherine, have I got you at last?''_<br/>`` I really think that you are right as usual,'' said she at last.

_was her address on Catherine's entering the box and sitting by her._<br/>She rose to follow her, but her head was in a whirl with new thoughts, and she sat down again.

_`` Now, Mr. Morland,'' for he was close to her on the other side,`` I shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening; so I charge you not to expect it._<br/>From that time I have never heard him allude to the matter, nor did he ever give us any reason why he should so confidently have expected the second coming upon that particular night.

_My sweetest Catherine, how have you been this long age?_<br/>Miss Brenda Tregennis had been a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age.

_But I need not ask you, for you look delightfully._<br/>I can not ask you to share it.''

_You really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever; you mischievous creature, do you want to attract everybody?_<br/>`` Well, to tell the truth, your people seemed more lively and generally human than I have ever seen them.

_I assure you, my brother is quite in love with you already; and as for Mr. Tilney-- but that is a settled thing-- even your modesty can not doubt his attachment now; his coming back to Bath makes it too plain._<br/>All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,-- for you have not done me a very good turn,-- but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.''

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_What would not I give to see him!_<br/>It would not have been a surprise to him.

_I really am quite wild with impatience._<br/>I am strangely familiar with your features.''

_My mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world; she saw him this morning, you know; you must introduce him to me._<br/>It is the love of a woman that makes the story of a man, and many a year was to pass before I first looked into the eyes of the mother of my children.

_Is he in the house now?_<br/>What was he now?

_Look about, for heaven's sake!_<br/>` For God's sake do something for me!'

_I assure you, I can hardly exist till I see him.''_<br/>`` And yet I agree with you that we can not go back until we have tried.''

_`` No,'' said Catherine,`` he is not here; I can not see him anywhere.''_<br/>`` No, master, I have not seen him.''

_`` Oh, horrid!_<br/>`` It's dreadful-- dreadful!''

_Am I never to be acquainted with him?_<br/>Am I never to have any privacy?

_How do you like my gown?_<br/>How do you like your new costume?

_I think it does not look amiss; the sleeves were entirely my own thought._<br/>`` I'm not quite clear in my own mind how these things should be approached,-- if they are to be approached at all,-- but I am sure this is not the way.

_Do you know, I get so immoderately sick of Bath; your brother and I were agreeing this morning that, though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks, we would not live here for millions._<br/>It may have been a humble object-lesson, but I give you my word that many a time in my life I have braced myself to a hard task by the remembrance of that morning upon Crawley Downs, asking myself if my manhood were so weak that I would not do for my country, or for those whom I loved, as much as these two would endure for a paltry stake and for their own credit amongst their fellows.

_We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place; really, our opinions were so exactly the same, it was quite ridiculous!_<br/>All this impressed me very much, as here, independently, we had exactly the same results, without any question of American frauds, or modern vulgarity, which were so often raised against similar phenomena in Europe.

_There was not a single point in which we differed; I would not have had you by for the world; you are such a sly thing, I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it.''_<br/>It was not the first time, my friends, as you are well aware, and you know the reasons that I had to trust that neither nerve nor judgment would ever fail me.

_`` No, indeed I should not.''_<br/>`` No, I will not.''

_`` Oh, yes you would indeed; I know you better than you know yourself._<br/>`` Ah, that is more than I can tell.

_You would have told us that we seemed born for each other, or some nonsense of that kind, which would have distressed me beyond conception; my cheeks would have been as red as your roses; I would not have had you by for the world.''_<br/>Through all my adventurous life I have never been so close upon the threshold of death as at that moment, and yet I declare to you that, terrible as my position was, I could think of nothing but the tattoo marks upon old Solomon Sprent's arm, and the cunning fashion in which he had interwoven the red and the blue.

_`` Indeed you do me injustice; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account; and besides, I am sure it would never have entered my head.''_<br/>`` I am sorry to be a disappointment to you, sir,'' said I. `` It is your misfortune not to have come under my influence earlier,'' said he.

_Isabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to James._<br/>`` This is Mr. St. James's way of talking,'' said the principal, smiling nervously as he glanced at me.

_Catherine's resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next morning; and till the usual moment of going to the pump-room, she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_But nothing of that kind occurred, no visitors appeared to delay them, and they all three set off in good time for the pump-room, where the ordinary course of events and conversation took place; Mr. Allen, after drinking his glass of water, joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their newspapers; and the ladies walked about together, noticing every new face, and almost every new bonnet in the room._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_The female part of the Thorpe family, attended by James Morland, appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour, and Catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend._<br/>He was married to the second daughter of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir Lothian's descendants have their eye upon the property, they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them.

_James, who was now in constant attendance, maintained a similar position, and separating themselves from the rest of their party, they walked in that manner for some time, till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which, confining her entirely to her friend and brother, gave her very little share in the notice of either._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_They were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute, but their sentiment was conveyed in such whispering voices, and their vivacity attended with so much laughter, that though Catherine's supporting opinion was not unfrequently called for by one or the other, she was never able to give any, from not having heard a word of the subject._<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_At length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend, by the avowed necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom she most joyfully saw just entering the room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom she instantly joined, with a firmer determination to be acquainted, than she might have had courage to command, had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Miss Tilney met her with great civility, returned her advances with equal goodwill, and they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the room; and though in all probability not an observation was made, nor an expression used by either which had not been made and used some thousands of times before, under that roof, in every Bath season, yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity and truth, and without personal conceit, might be something uncommon._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` How well your brother dances!''_<br/>`` And your brother?''

_was an artless exclamation of Catherine's towards the close of their conversation, which at once surprised and amused her companion._<br/>Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand.

_`` Henry!''_<br/>`` James!''

_she replied with a smile._<br/>she cried, with a mischievous smile.

_`` Yes, he does dance very well.''_<br/>`` Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough!

_`` He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other evening, when he saw me sitting down._<br/> He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them.

_But I really had been engaged the whole day to Mr. Thorpe.''_<br/>I had been engaged by some people of the name of Silcoe.

_Miss Tilney could only bow._<br/>I have just promised Mrs. Westmacott that I will do so.

_`` You can not think,'' added Catherine after a moment's silence,`` how surprised I was to see him again._<br/>I can not think of it,'' said she;`` could _ you _, if you had left the man you love behind you, as I have mine?''

_I felt so sure of his being quite gone away.''_<br/>I feel that we have gone too far already.''

_`` When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before, he was in Bath but for a couple of days._<br/>`` I'll do it with pleasure,'' said I.`` In fact, I would rather go by rail, for we shall have enough and to spare of the sea before we reach Colombo.

_He came only to engage lodgings for us.''_<br/>He would not make a fit partner for me.''

_`` That never occurred to me; and of course, not seeing him anywhere, I thought he must be gone._<br/>`` Do you mean to say that I create a thing which has never existed by merely thinking of it?''

_Was not the young lady he danced with on Monday a Miss Smith?''_<br/>She could not forget that when Charles Westmacott had spoken to her one night he had alluded to the possibility of his aunt marrying again.

_`` Yes, an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes.''_<br/>`` For the mistress, Mr. Johnson.

_`` I dare say she was very glad to dance._<br/>`` I dare say that you will do very well,'' said he.

_Do you think her pretty?''_<br/>Do you understand me?''

_`` Not very.''_<br/>`` Not a bit.

_`` He never comes to the pump-room, I suppose?''_<br/>`` He never existed.''

_`` Yes, sometimes; but he has rid out this morning with my father.''_<br/>` Use it as though it were your own,' said my father.

_Mrs. Hughes now joined them, and asked Miss Tilney if she was ready to go._<br/>`` But you must leave me,'' said Miss Adams, earnestly.

_`` I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon,'' said Catherine._<br/>I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith.

_`` Shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow?''_<br/>I suppose I shall see you at the Downs to-morrow?''

_`` Perhaps we-- Yes, I think we certainly shall.''_<br/>`` Then I certainly will.

_`` I am glad of it, for we shall all be there.''_<br/>`` I am glad of that.''

_This civility was duly returned; and they parted-- on Miss Tilney's side with some knowledge of her new acquaintance's feelings, and on Catherine's, without the smallest consciousness of having explained them._<br/>How spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by Miss Julia Ames, who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication, but admitted, after fifteen years, that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over.

_She went home very happy._<br/>`` You look very happy,'' said he.

_The morning had answered all her hopes, and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation, the future good._<br/>`` But we have already taken too much of your time, and so I beg to thank you for your kindness and to wish you good morning.''

_What gown and what head-dress she should wear on the occasion became her chief concern._<br/>You shall have such an allowance as will permit you to keep up a proper appearance as my aide-de-camp, and I have determined to marry you suitably to one of the ladies-in-waiting of the Empress.'

_She can not be justified in it._<br/>She can not deny it.'

_Dress is at all times a frivolous distinction, and excessive solicitude about it often destroys its own aim._<br/>All of them agree that this state of bewilderment is harmful and retarding to the spirit, and that some knowledge of the actual truth upon this side is the only way to make sure of not being dazed upon the other.

_Catherine knew all this very well; her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas before; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin, and nothing but the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_This would have been an error in judgment, great though not uncommon, from which one of the other sex rather than her own, a brother rather than a great aunt, might have warned her, for man only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_It would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire; how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged, the mull, or the jackonet._<br/>A bad man he was in many ways, my dears, cunning and wily, with little scruple or conscience; and yet so strange a thing is human nature, and so difficult is it for us to control our feelings, that my heart warms when I think of him, and that fifty years have increased rather than weakened the kindliness which I hear to him.

_Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone._<br/>The lady is of excellent family and she is not wanting in personal charm.

_No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for it._<br/>No man will take her from me.

_Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter._<br/>Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal.

_But not one of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of Catherine._<br/>Dost not know that a word of what you have said, whispered to the nearest justice of the peace, might mean your liberty, if not your life?'

_She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the Monday before._<br/> When the Doctor came down to the dining-room next morning, he was surprised to find that his daughters had already been up some time.

_She had then been exulting in her engagement to Thorpe, and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight, lest he should engage her again; for though she could not, dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her a third time to dance, her wishes, hopes, and plans all centred in nothing less._<br/>She went on to say that the sphere she inhabited was all round the earth; that she knew about the planets; that Mars was inhabited by a race more advanced than us, and that the canals were artificial; there was no bodily pain in her sphere, but there could be mental anxiety; they were governed; they took nourishment; she had been a Catholic and was still a Catholic, but had not fared better than the Protestants; there were Buddhists and Mohammedans in her sphere, but all fared alike; she had never seen Christ and knew no more about Him than on earth, but believed in His influence; spirits prayed and they died in their new sphere before entering another; they had pleasures-- music was among them.

_Every young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for every young lady has at some time or other known the same agitation._<br/>I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing.

_All have been, or at least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from the pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid; and all have been anxious for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please._<br/>So far all had been kindly, however far apart our desires might be; but we felt well assured that our actual plans of a descent must be kept secret, for we had reason to fear that at the last they might try to hold us by force.

_As soon as they were joined by the Thorpes, Catherine's agony began; she fidgeted about if John Thorpe came towards her, hid herself as much as possible from his view, and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him._<br/>It was agony to him to hear that she was about to straighten little Alec Turner's club-foot, and right at the fringe of the rumour came a note from his mother, the rector's wife, asking him if he would be so good as to act as chloroformist.

_The cotillions were over, the country-dancing beginning, and she saw nothing of the Tilneys._<br/>It was evident that we had passed through the Cossacks and that there was nothing between us and our goal.

_`` Do not be frightened, my dear Catherine,'' whispered Isabella,`` but I am really going to dance with your brother again._<br/>` Do not judge my father by his words, but by his deeds,' said she, with a warning finger upraised;` and, above all, Cousin Louis, unless you wish to have my life upon your conscience, never let him suspect that I have said a word to set you on your guard.'

_I declare positively it is quite shocking._<br/>I declare it is getting quite unendurable.''

_I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself, but you and John must keep us in countenance._<br/>`` You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

_Make haste, my dear creature, and come to us._<br/>Tell me, dear, have you often felt like this?

_John is just walked off, but he will be back in a moment.''_<br/>After you was gone he walked and he walked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of his footstep.

_Catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer._<br/>` No, nor that either.'

_The others walked away, John Thorpe was still in view, and she gave herself up for lost._<br/>After you was gone he walked and he walked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of his footstep.

_That she might not appear, however, to observe or expect him, she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan; and a self-condemnation for her folly, in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the Tilneys in any reasonable time, had just passed through her mind, when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance, by Mr. Tilney himself._<br/>As she could not speak a word of the language, however, and was unable to make any of the delinquents understand what it was that she wanted, her passage up the Nile left the immemorial East very much as she had found it, but afforded a good deal of sympathetic amusement to her fellow-travellers.

_With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request, and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went with him to the set, may be easily imagined._<br/>Rather would I fancy that a glow of admiration filled their breasts, and that their one desire was to embrace the stranger who had carried himself so gallantly and well.

_To escape, and, as she believed, so narrowly escape John Thorpe, and to be asked, so immediately on his joining her, asked by Mr. Tilney, as if he had sought her on purpose!_<br/>I felt that if I did not discharge my pistol Lord Dacre's honour might feel hurt, and yet it was quite impossible for me, after hearing what this lady has said, to aim it at her husband.

_-- it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity._<br/>It did not seem to be any personal concern of mine.

_Scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a place, however, when her attention was claimed by John Thorpe, who stood behind her._<br/> I had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the quiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his intense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the expectation.

_`` Heyday, Miss Morland!''_<br/>`` Look, Miss Adams!

_said he._<br/>said he.

_`` What is the meaning of this?_<br/>What is the meaning of this?''

_I thought you and I were to dance together.''_<br/>but she went on with her dance.

_`` I wonder you should think so, for you never asked me.''_<br/>`` You knew it, and never told us!''

_`` That is a good one, by Jove!_<br/>`` By Jove, yes; there's some one there.

_I asked you as soon as I came into the room, and I was just going to ask you again, but when I turned round, you were gone!_<br/>I asked, eagerly, when we had regained the lower room once more.

_This is a cursed shabby trick!_<br/>It was horrible-- horrible!

_I only came for the sake of dancing with you, and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since Monday._<br/>From that time I have never heard him allude to the matter, nor did he ever give us any reason why he should so confidently have expected the second coming upon that particular night.

_Yes; I remember, I asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak._<br/>I wanted to say to you that, if I were you, I should change my rooms at once.''

_And here have I been telling all my acquaintance that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room; and when they see you standing up with somebody else, they will quiz me famously.''_<br/>There was something in the gentleness of his rebuke, and in his appeal to her mother, which brought the tears to her eyes, and in another instant she would have been kneeling beside him with everything confessed, when the door flew open and her sister Ida came bounding into the room.

_`` Oh, no; they will never think of me, after such a description as that.''_<br/>`` Well, no; I do n't think that is quite the idea, either.

_`` By heavens, if they do not, I will kick them out of the room for blockheads._<br/>`` Not a capillary,'' said I.`` Now, look here; I'll throw up the whole business unless you give me your word to behave yourself.

_What chap have you there?''_<br/>What have we here?

_Catherine satisfied his curiosity._<br/>The Doctor looked pleased.

_`` Tilney,'' he repeated._<br/>he repeated.

_`` Hum-- I do not know him._<br/>`` But I do not know what to do.

_A good figure of a man; well put together._<br/>`` That's a good guess,'' said he.

_Does he want a horse?_<br/>What do you think of that horse?''

_Here is a friend of mine, Sam Fletcher, has got one to sell that would suit anybody._<br/>And if what I tell you should ever chance to differ from what you have read in the book of Mr. Coke or of Mr. Oldmixon, or of any one else who has set these matters down in print, do ye bear in mind that I am telling of what I saw with these very eyes, and that I have helped to make history, which is a higher thing than to write it.

_A famous clever animal for the road-- only forty guineas._<br/>A challenge to match my bird Julius against my Lord Dorchester's cockerel for a hundred guineas.

_I had fifty minds to buy it myself, for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when I meet with one; but it would not answer my purpose, it would not do for the field._<br/>I have always been a judge of a horse, and I had a good look at these ones, but I could not see that there was much to be said for them.

_I would give any money for a real good hunter._<br/>I wonder if any friend would do as much for me!''

_I have three now, the best that ever were backed._<br/>I think that it is the most sincere compliment that I have ever had paid me.''

_I would not take eight hundred guineas for them._<br/>They could not be more than ten paces from us.

_Fletcher and I mean to get a house in Leicestershire, against the next season._<br/>I return to Southampton to-morrow, and I shall hope to see you in the course of the next week.''

_It is so d-- uncomfortable, living at an inn.''_<br/>If a subject is painful why treat it at all?

_This was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine's attention, for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Her partner now drew near, and said,`` That gentleman would have put me out of patience, had he stayed with you half a minute longer._<br/>I took her hand, and in two minutes we were on such terms that her husband swore roundly that he would give me up himself if I pressed the matter farther.

_He has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me._<br/>I had no orders about them from the master.''

_We have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening, and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time._<br/>My energies shall now be devoted to devising some means by which spirits may be able to recollect what occurs to them in their free state, and I trust that when I have worked this out, I may have the pleasure of meeting you all once again in this hall, and demonstrating to you the result.''

_Nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one, without injuring the rights of the other._<br/>No, no, I must tear myself away-- even her persuasions were unable to make me stop.

_I consider a country-dance as an emblem of marriage._<br/>I am thinking of getting married.''

_Fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both; and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves, have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours.''_<br/>`` I am sure, Monsieur Fardet,'' said Mrs. Belmont,`` that you, who are a Frenchman, and therefore a man of gallantry and honour, would not permit your own wounded feelings to interfere with the fulfilment of your promise and your duty towards three helpless ladies.''

_`` But they are such very different things!''_<br/>`` But you are very strong.''

_''-- That you think they can not be compared together.''_<br/>`` We can not reckon time as you do.

_`` To be sure not._<br/>`` Certainly not.''

_People that marry can never part, but must go and keep house together._<br/>She and I never took to each other very much; but now I hope all that may be ended, and when I marry she will come and stay with me.''

_People that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour.''_<br/>And then, whether it was this nerve-racking vision before me, or whether, my task finished, all the overwork of the past weeks came in one crushing weight upon me, the room danced round me, the floor seemed to sink away beneath my feet, and I remembered no more.

_`` And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing._<br/>`` Yes, indeed; and I hope you will come to my wedding, all of you.

_Taken in that light certainly, their resemblance is not striking; but I think I could place them in such a view._<br/>`` I'm not quite clear in my own mind how these things should be approached,-- if they are to be approached at all,-- but I am sure this is not the way.

_You will allow, that in both, man has the advantage of choice, woman only the power of refusal; that in both, it is an engagement between man and woman, formed for the advantage of each; and that when once entered into, they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution; that it is their duty, each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere, and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours, or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else._<br/>And so also, when the ring has become as extinct as the lists, we may understand that a broader philosophy would show that all things, which spring up so naturally and spontaneously, have a function to fulfil, and that it is a less evil that two men should, of their own free will, fight until they can fight no more than that the standard of hardihood and endurance should run the slightest risk of being lowered in a nation which depends so largely upon the individual qualities of her citizens for her defence.

_You will allow all this?''_<br/>Do you follow all this?''

_`` Yes, to be sure, as you state it, all this sounds very well; but still they are so very different._<br/>`` Well, perhaps if both love, it may be different.

_I can not look upon them at all in the same light, nor think the same duties belong to them.''_<br/>And yet it is so real with me, so entirely part of my very self, that I can not help acting upon it.

_`` In one respect, there certainly is a difference._<br/>`` But there is such a sudden change in them both.''

_In marriage, the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman, the woman to make the home agreeable to the man; he is to purvey, and she is to smile._<br/>`` If I may read your life, I would venture to say that you were destined to fulfil the lot of women-- to make some good man happy, and to shed around, in some wider circle, the pleasure which your society has given me since first I knew you.''

_But in dancing, their duties are exactly changed; the agreeableness, the compliance are expected from him, while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water._<br/>'T is true that if La Jeune were dancing, or if Mrs. Bracegirdle or Mrs. Oldfield came upon the boards, we would hum and clap, but it was the fine woman that we applauded rather than the actress.'

_That, I suppose, was the difference of duties which struck you, as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison.''_<br/>I would have you to understand that it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, and I refuse to entertain the most remote sense of personal obligation.

_`` No, indeed, I never thought of that.''_<br/>`` No, no: I never guess.

_`` Then I am quite at a loss._<br/>`` I'm sorry I missed it.

_One thing, however, I must observe._<br/>However, we must do what we can.

_This disposition on your side is rather alarming._<br/>That is his most dangerous subject.

_You totally disallow any similarity in the obligations; and may I not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish?_<br/>I do not speak upon this subject as an amateur, nor, I may add, as a popular lecturer, but I speak as one whose scientific conscience compels him to adhere closely to facts, when I say that Mr. Waldron is very wrong in supposing that because he has never himself seen a so-called prehistoric animal, therefore these creatures no longer exist.

_Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return, or if any other gentleman were to address you, there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose?''_<br/>Now one thing I have to say to you, and I speak it that all may hear, and that none may hereafter complain that the rules he serves under were not made clear to him.

_`` Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother's, that if he talks to me, I must talk to him again; but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that I have any acquaintance with.''_<br/>`` I knew you fairly well, sir, in our youth; but you will allow me to observe that neither I nor any friend of yours ever heard of a wife or a son.

_`` And is that to be my only security?_<br/>` And what is that to me?'

_Alas, alas!''_<br/>` Alas, alas!

_`` Nay, I am sure you can not have a better; for if I do not know anybody, it is impossible for me to talk to them; and, besides, I do not want to talk to anybody.''_<br/>`` I will tell you about him-- or a little about him, for he has done much which I would not care to talk of, nor you to listen to.

_`` Now you have given me a security worth having; and I shall proceed with courage._<br/>`` I thank you, sir, for the kind interest which you take in me,'' said I. `` But you must be a credit to me.

_Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of making the inquiry before?''_<br/>I think that perhaps I have interest enough with the Pope to ask him, in return for any little attention which we gave him at the Coronation, to show you some leniency in this matter.

_`` Yes, quite-- more so, indeed.''_<br/>`` Yes, quite recently.''

_`` More so!_<br/>`` Stangerson too!''

_Take care, or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time._<br/>You are tired of me, and by the gods I am tired of you, and glad to be at the end of it.

_You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks.''_<br/>They must be full cry upon our scent this four hours.

_`` I do not think I should be tired, if I were to stay here six months.''_<br/> They were ten days which I am not likely to forget.

_`` Bath, compared with London, has little variety, and so everybody finds out every year._<br/> Crabbe took his degree a year before I did, and went down to a large port in England with the intention of setting up there.

_` For six weeks, I allow Bath is pleasant enough; but beyond that, it is the most tiresome place in the world.'_<br/>In six weeks or two months we shall be in London, and it is possible that this letter may not reach you much earlier than we do ourselves.

_You would be told so by people of all descriptions, who come regularly every winter, lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve, and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer.''_<br/>I find,'' he continued, glancing over the pages of his ledger,`` that within the last twelve months we have supplied no fewer than seven Latin masters to Willow Lea House Academy, four of them having left so abruptly as to forfeit their month's salary, and none of them having stayed more than eight weeks.''

_`` Well, other people must judge for themselves, and those who go to London may think nothing of Bath._<br/>`` For my part,'' said Holmes,`` whatever you may choose to say will go no further.''

_But I, who live in a small retired village in the country, can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home; for here are a variety of amusements, a variety of things to be seen and done all day long, which I can know nothing of there.''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` You are not fond of the country.''_<br/>`` But you are not satisfied, Charles.

_`` Yes, I am._<br/>`` I am.''

_I have always lived there, and always been very happy._<br/>I told him that I should be very happy.

_But certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a Bath life._<br/>We could be far happier together in a little cottage in the country than with all the riches of the City.

_One day in the country is exactly like another.''_<br/>But one day was exactly like another.

_`` But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country.''_<br/>`` It depends so much upon what you can do, you know.

_`` Do I?''_<br/> And I?

_`` Do you not?''_<br/>`` Why should you not?''

_`` I do not believe there is much difference.''_<br/>`` I do not know.''

_`` Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long.''_<br/> All this, which takes me so long to describe, impressed itself upon me in a few seconds.

_`` And so I am at home-- only I do not find so much of it._<br/> But I am not taken so easily.

_I walk about here, and so I do there; but here I see a variety of people in every street, and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen.''_<br/>Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement.

_Mr. Tilney was very much amused._<br/> Brother William was deeply shocked.

_`` Only go and call on Mrs. Allen!''_<br/>`` Oh, then, you live also with Mrs. Adams!''

_he repeated._<br/>he repeated.

_`` What a picture of intellectual poverty!_<br/>What a picture!

_However, when you sink into this abyss again, you will have more to say._<br/>` Sink me, if I could remember where I had seen your face, but now it comes back to me very clearly.'

_You will be able to talk of Bath, and of all that you did here.''_<br/>You'll just need to be patient awhile, and then you'll be all right.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Yes._<br/>Yes.''

_I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs. Allen, or anybody else._<br/>I shall never go to that doctor again,' says she afterwards.

_I really believe I shall always be talking of Bath, when I am at home again-- I do like it so very much._<br/>But I am telling you frankly, at Lord Avon's request, all that I thought and did upon that night, and I shall continue to do so, even if I am not fortunate enough to win your approval.

_If I could but have Papa and Mamma, and the rest of them here, I suppose I should be too happy!_<br/>But I really do love you very much, and you would make me happy if you came to Texas with me, and I think that perhaps after a time I could make you happy too.''

_James's coming-LRB- my eldest brother-RRB- is quite delightful-- and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already._<br/>Though my parents had been married so long, they had really seen very little of each other, and their affection was as warm and as fresh as if they were two newly-wedded lovers.

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_Who can ever be tired of Bath?''_<br/>` Who ever saw such a shambles?

_`` Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do._<br/> I do not know if that voice thrilled through every one as it did through me.

_But papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends are a good deal gone by, to most of the frequenters of Bath-- and the honest relish of balls and plays, and everyday sights, is past with them.''_<br/>But if you would come out with me into that forgotten world; if you would know Boy Jim and Champion Harrison; if you would meet my father, one of Nelson's own men; if you would catch a glimpse of that great seaman himself, and of George, afterwards the unworthy King of England; if, above all, you would see my famous uncle, Sir Charles Tregellis, the King of the Bucks, and the great fighting men whose names are still household words amongst you, then give me your hand and let us start.

_Here their conversation closed, the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention._<br/>Their talk was sometimes merry and sometimes sad, but there was a forced note in their merriment and a naturalness in their sadness which told me that a heavy heart beat upon either side of me.

_Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set, Catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers-on, immediately behind her partner._<br/> I was at my wit's ends what to do, whether to be silent, or to tell her of the terrible position in which her lover was placed; but, even as I hesitated, she, with the quick intuition of a woman, read the doubts which were in my mind.

_He was a very handsome man, of a commanding aspect, past the bloom, but not past the vigour of life; and with his eye still directed towards her, she saw him presently address Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper._<br/>He had not yet attained his full six foot of stature, but no judge of a man-LRB- and every woman, at least, is one-RRB- could look at his perfect shoulders, his narrow loins, and his proud head that sat upon his neck like an eagle upon its perch, without feeling that sober joy which all that is beautiful in Nature gives to us-- a vague self- content, as though in some way we also had a hand in the making of it.

_Confused by his notice, and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance, she turned away her head._<br/>She felt suddenly that she was giving herself away, and she changed her face to a kindly, friendly smile, but it was too late, for I had had my warning.

_But while she did so, the gentleman retreated, and her partner, coming nearer, said,`` I see that you guess what I have just been asked._<br/>I confess that at the beginning I did not tell him what I had seen, and my excuse must be that he disappeared before I had time to determine what I should do.

_That gentleman knows your name, and you have a right to know his._<br/>Uncle, here's a gentleman who wants to speak with you.''

_It is General Tilney, my father.''_<br/>`` Roddy, darling, here's your father!''

_Catherine's answer was only`` Oh!''_<br/>`` Oh, Clara, if it were only that!

_-- but it was an`` Oh!''_<br/>Yes, it was indeed so.

_expressing everything needful: attention to his words, and perfect reliance on their truth._<br/>But he feared above all things lest he should offend her, and so put an end to their present pleasant intimacy.

_With real interest and strong admiration did her eye now follow the general, as he moved through the crowd, and`` How handsome a family they are!''_<br/>It made me proud as I watched him to think that so magnificent a man, with such easy, masterful ways, should be my own blood relation, and I could see from my mother's eyes as they turned towards him that the same thought was in her mind.

_was her secret remark._<br/>said she in surprise.

_In chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded, a new source of felicity arose to her._<br/> Mrs. Westmacott's great meeting for the enfranchisement of woman had passed over, and it had been a triumphant success.

_She had never taken a country walk since her arrival in Bath._<br/>She had never been from home before, and she was now busy upon the self-imposed task of bringing the East up to the standard of Massachusetts.

_Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar, spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too; and on her openly fearing that she might find nobody to go with her, it was proposed by the brother and sister that they should join in a walk, some morning or other._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_`` I shall like it,'' she cried,`` beyond anything in the world; and do not let us put it off-- let us go tomorrow.''_<br/>But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed.

_This was readily agreed to, with only a proviso of Miss Tilney's, that it did not rain, which Catherine was sure it would not._<br/> We came to Oban in the rain, I need not mention it again, For you may take it as a fact That in that Western Highland tract It sometimes spouts and sometimes drops, But never, never, never stops.

_At twelve o'clock, they were to call for her in Pulteney Street; and`` Remember-- twelve o'clock,'' was her parting speech to her new friend._<br/>About six years ago-- to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882-- an advertisement appeared in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward.

_Of her other, her older, her more established friend, Isabella, of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight's experience, she scarcely saw anything during the evening._<br/>As for me, I had sprung to the side of the old friend of my boyhood, and was trying to tell him my joy at his good fortune, and listening to his assurance that nothing that could ever befall him could weaken the love that he bore me.

_Yet, though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness, she cheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen, which took them rather early away, and her spirits danced within her, as she danced in her chair all the way home._<br/>On this she sprang out of her chair with a cry of great joy, and holding the garment which she was mending over her head, and swaying it from side to side with the motion of her body, she danced as lightly as a feather all round the room, and then out through the open door into the sunshine.

_CHAPTER 11  The morrow brought a very sober-looking morning, the sun making only a few efforts to appear, and Catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_A bright morning so early in the year, she allowed, would generally turn to rain, but a cloudy one foretold improvement as the day advanced._<br/> As she turned slowly round, and the sunshine struck upon her face, the two watchers were amazed to see that this very active and energetic lady was far from being in her first youth, so far that she had certainly come of age again since she first passed that landmark in life's journey.

_She applied to Mr. Allen for confirmation of her hopes, but Mr. Allen, not having his own skies and barometer about him, declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine._<br/>She saw her face as the glass reflected it, but she did not see the changing play of expression which gave it its charm-- the infinite pity, the sympathy, the sweet womanliness which drew towards her all who were in doubt and in trouble, even as poor slow-moving Charles Westmacott had been drawn to her that night.

_She applied to Mrs. Allen, and Mrs. Allen's opinion was more positive._<br/>She began to praise you, I said what I felt, and then in an instant it was all out.''

_`` She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day, if the clouds would only go off, and the sun keep out.''_<br/>She was very good over the matter, but every now and again _ he _ would fetch a hollow groan, and I noticed that he held his right hand just under the sheet all the time, where I had no doubt that it was clasped by her left.

_At about eleven o'clock, however, a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught Catherine's watchful eye, and`` Oh!_<br/>`` It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents.

_dear, I do believe it will be wet,'' broke from her in a most desponding tone._<br/>Presently it broke upon us again, wild, shrill, and agonised: the scream of a woman in mortal distress.

_`` I thought how it would be,'' said Mrs. Allen._<br/>`` Well, I suppose it would,'' said Lord John.

_`` No walk for me today,'' sighed Catherine;`` but perhaps it may come to nothing, or it may hold up before twelve.''_<br/> But it was no easy thing for me to think seriously of anything in the hamlet; for I was in some way, my dear children, though I say it myself, a favourite with the young and with the old, so that I could not walk ten paces without some greeting or address.

_`` Perhaps it may, but then, my dear, it will be so dirty.''_<br/>`` Well, perhaps if both love, it may be different.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_That will not signify; I never mind dirt.''_<br/>It would not be right nor honorable.''

_`` No,'' replied her friend very placidly,`` I know you never mind dirt.''_<br/>`` No, Mr. Stephens, I've had such a good time all my life, that I do n't think, when I look back, that I ever had any real cause for sorrow.''

_After a short pause,`` It comes on faster and faster!''_<br/>`` Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.''

_said Catherine, as she stood watching at a window._<br/>But then as she stood at the casement, the girl beneath looked smilingly up at her and beckoned to her with a merry gesture to open the window.

_`` So it does indeed._<br/> And it did.

_If it keeps raining, the streets will be very wet.''_<br/>How the rain is splashing in the street.

_`` There are four umbrellas up already._<br/>`` There will be two or three in the boat.

_How I hate the sight of an umbrella!''_<br/>How you must hate and loathe me!

_`` They are disagreeable things to carry._<br/>`` You say they are dangerous.

_I would much rather take a chair at any time.''_<br/>What would words do for you if you were in this chair and I in that?

_`` It was such a nice-looking morning!_<br/> It was a blithesome morning.

_I felt so convinced it would be dry!''_<br/>I think it would be very nice.''

_`` Anybody would have thought so indeed._<br/>`` I should think so.

_There will be very few people in the pump-room, if it rains all the morning._<br/>What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday!

_I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes, but I dare say he will not, for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat; I wonder he should dislike it, it must be so comfortable.''_<br/>I took the precaution of walking the horse very quietly until we were some distance from the house, for I had told Reuben nothing of my intended journey, and I was convinced that if he knew of it neither discipline, nor even his new ties of love, would prevent him from coming with me.

_The rain continued-- fast, though not heavy._<br/>`` There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain.

_Catherine went every five minutes to the clock, threatening on each return that, if it still kept on raining another five minutes, she would give up the matter as hopeless._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The clock struck twelve, and it still rained._<br/>It told him that it was half-past seven, and that he had been gone an hour and a quarter.

_`` You will not be able to go, my dear.''_<br/>You would not desire it, dear, would you?''

_`` I do not quite despair yet._<br/>`` Then your case is not hopeless.

_I shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve._<br/>`` I shall not dream of dying for at least another thirty years.

_This is just the time of day for it to clear up, and I do think it looks a little lighter._<br/>It will be time enough to discuss the why and the wherefore when he is a little stronger.

_There, it is twenty minutes after twelve, and now I shall give it up entirely._<br/>I have but seen them this once in ten years, and it may be ten more, for all I know, ere I see them again.

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_That we had such weather here as they had at Udolpho, or at least in Tuscany and the south of France!_<br/>But at present just here in North Africa there is Italy in Abyssinia, and England in Egypt, and France in Algiers--'' `` France!''

_-- the night that poor St. Aubin died!_<br/>It was when my poor mother died.

_-- such beautiful weather!''_<br/>beautiful!

_At half past twelve, when Catherine's anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment, the sky began voluntarily to clear._<br/> I began to understand as I listened to him that my friends in England had not been so far wrong when they had declared that as long as he lived-- this little thirty-six year old artilleryman-- there could not possibly be any peace in the world.

_A gleam of sunshine took her quite by surprise; she looked round; the clouds were parting, and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance._<br/> As she turned slowly round, and the sunshine struck upon her face, the two watchers were amazed to see that this very active and energetic lady was far from being in her first youth, so far that she had certainly come of age again since she first passed that landmark in life's journey.

_Ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed, and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen, who had`` always thought it would clear up.''_<br/>Why, he was turned five- and-fifty when he challenged and beat, after fifty minutes of it, Jack Thornhill, who was tough enough to take it out of many a youngster.

_But whether Catherine might still expect her friends, whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture, must yet be a question._<br/>Again, if Miss Julia Ames can tell Mr. Stead things in her own earth life of which he could not have cognisance, and if those things are shown, when tested, to be true, then one is more inclined to think that those things which can not be tested are true also.

_It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the pump-room; he accordingly set off by himself, and Catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages, containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back._<br/> Having got so far, Defoe remarked that he thought he had given them a fair start, and handed over the story to Dean Swift, who, after premising that he feared he would find himself as much at sea as Master Cyprian Overbeck Wells, continued in this way:-- `` For two days I drifted about in great distress, fearing that there should be a return of the gale, and keeping an eager look-out for my late companions.

_`` Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe, I declare!_<br/>`` That's my nephew, Sir Charles.''

_They are coming for me perhaps-- but I shall not go-- I can not go indeed, for you know Miss Tilney may still call.''_<br/>I have, as I said, done Mortimer some turns which he might remember, though it did not become me to remind him of them.

_Mrs. Allen agreed to it._<br/>asked Mrs. Adams.

_John Thorpe was soon with them, and his voice was with them yet sooner, for on the stairs he was calling out to Miss Morland to be quick._<br/>Charles Westmacott knew little enough of City life and the ways of business, but at least he had more experience in both than the Admiral, and he made up his mind not to leave him until the matter was settled.

_`` Make haste!_<br/>Do!''

_Make haste!''_<br/>Do!''

_as he threw open the door._<br/>He pushed open the door.''

_`` Put on your hat this moment-- there is no time to be lost-- we are going to Bristol._<br/>`` The odds are that this plateau is of no great size, and we shall travel round it until we either find an easy way up it, or come back to the point from which we started.''

_How d'ye do, Mrs. Allen?''_<br/>How d'ye do, Mrs. Harrison?

_`` To Bristol!_<br/>`` To London!''

_Is not that a great way off?_<br/>Is it not splendid?

_But, however, I can not go with you today, because I am engaged; I expect some friends every moment.''_<br/>I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you, but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say.

_This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all; Mrs. Allen was called on to second him, and the two others walked in, to give their assistance._<br/>It needed no questioning to get at her knowledge, for she was so full of indignation that she shook with passion as she spoke of it, and raised her hands into the air in the earnestness of her denunciation, as she described the grievances which she had against my colleague.

_`` My sweetest Catherine, is not this delightful?_<br/>The lady is of excellent family and she is not wanting in personal charm.

_We shall have a most heavenly drive._<br/>`` Perhaps, sir, I had better drive.''

_You are to thank your brother and me for the scheme; it darted into our heads at breakfast-time, I verily believe at the same instant; and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain._<br/> But in spite of gleams of sunshine, there was thunder in the air, and Champion Harrison had just whispered in my ear that he was quite sure that we should never get through the night without trouble, and was advising me, if it got very bad, to take refuge under the table, when the landlord entered the room hurriedly and handed a note to my uncle.

_But it does not signify, the nights are moonlight, and we shall do delightfully._<br/>And it is not the night which has chilled me.

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_I am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet!_<br/>It's the Oasis of Kurkur-- a little quiet, I am afraid, but excellent air.

_So much better than going to the Lower Rooms._<br/>`` You might do better than this.''

_We shall drive directly to Clifton and dine there; and, as soon as dinner is over, if there is time for it, go on to Kingsweston.''_<br/>If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.''

_`` I doubt our being able to do so much,'' said Morland._<br/>`` I dare say that you will do very well,'' said he.

_`` You croaking fellow!''_<br/>`` Confound the fellow!

_cried Thorpe._<br/>cried Stephens.

_`` We shall be able to do ten times more._<br/>The charge should be six times greater, and therefore, of course, it would be six times more effective.

_Kingsweston!_<br/>`` Ay-ah!

_Aye, and Blaize Castle too, and anything else we can hear of; but here is your sister says she will not go.''_<br/>`` If you will pledge your word that after this experiment I may have the hand of your daughter, then I am willing to assist you; but if not, I shall have nothing to do with it.

_`` Blaize Castle!''_<br/>`` Rose!''

_cried Catherine._<br/>Mary cried.

_`` What is that'?''_<br/>What is that?'

_`` The finest place in England-- worth going fifty miles at any time to see.''_<br/>` If the West can give eight thousand, how many can all the counties of England afford?'

_`` What, is it really a castle, an old castle?''_<br/>''` But what is the treasure, then?'

_`` The oldest in the kingdom.''_<br/>`` Our old life!''

_`` But is it like what one reads of?''_<br/>`` But what is it?''

_`` Exactly-- the very same.''_<br/>`` The same here.

_`` But now really-- are there towers and long galleries?''_<br/>`` Because there are so many pretty things upon the walls.''

_`` By dozens.''_<br/>' A dozen.

_`` Then I should like to see it; but I can not-- I can not go._<br/>`` I wish I could think it were not so.

_`` Not go!_<br/>`` Not I!''

_My beloved creature, what do you mean'?''_<br/>But our new comrade, what think you of him?'

_`` I can not go, because''-- looking down as she spoke, fearful of Isabella's smile--`` I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk._<br/>`` My first explanations I owe to you, Sir Charles,'' said Jim; and as I listened to his voice and noted his manner, I could not but admire the effect which the company of her whom he now knew to be his mother had had upon a rude country lad.

_They promised to come at twelve, only it rained; but now, as it is so fine, I dare say they will be here soon.''_<br/>I have but seen them this once in ten years, and it may be ten more, for all I know, ere I see them again.

_`` Not they indeed,'' cried Thorpe;`` for, as we turned into Broad Street, I saw them-- does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts?''_<br/>`` I do not need to be shown the way in a house where I have drunk many a bottle of good claret,'' cried a deep voice in reply; and there in the doorway stood the broad figure of Squire Ovington in his buckskins and top-boots, a riding-crop in his hand.

_`` I do not know indeed.''_<br/>`` I do not know.''

_`` Yes, I know he does; I saw him._<br/>`` Yes, I think he was.

_You are talking of the man you danced with last night, are not you?''_<br/>I do not know how you came to meet him last night, or what passed between you, for we do not share each other's confidences.

_`` Yes._<br/>`` Yes.

_`` Well, I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road, driving a smart-looking girl.''_<br/>`` At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door.

_`` Did you indeed?''_<br/>`` Did you?

_`` Did upon my soul; knew him again directly, and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too.''_<br/> As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul.

_`` It is very odd!_<br/>`` It seems most improbable.''

_But I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk.''_<br/>If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it.

_`` And well they might, for I never saw so much dirt in my life._<br/>`` On the contrary, I never spoke so deliberately in my life.

_Walk!_<br/>Go!''

_You could no more walk than you could fly!_<br/>There could no longer be a doubt.

_It has not been so dirty the whole winter; it is ankle-deep everywhere.''_<br/>There are some who say that the Bussex Rhine, as it is called, is not either deep or broad, and was, therefore, unmentioned by the moorsmen, but that the recent constant rains had swollen it to an extent never before known.

_Isabella corroborated it:`` My dearest Catherine, you can not form an idea of the dirt; come, you must go; you can not refuse going now.''_<br/>`` My dear Mrs. Westmacott,'' cried Clara,`` I assure you that I have not the least idea what it is that you are talking of.''

_`` I should like to see the castle; but may we go all over it?_<br/>`` I think we should see it to the end.''

_May we go up every staircase, and into every suite of rooms?''_<br/> We had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon the first floor.

_`` Yes, yes, every hole and corner.''_<br/>`` Oh, yes, all right.''

_`` But then, if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer, and call by and by?''_<br/>` If all are agreed,' said he,` let our word be`` Soho,'' and let us come upon them as soon after midnight as may be.

_`` Make yourself easy, there is no danger of that, for I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback, that they were going as far as Wick Rocks.''_<br/> The man, whom we already know as Theckla the Thracian, paid no heed to the attention which he had aroused, but strode onwards, stepping as lightly as a deer, until he reached the fringe of the soldiers.

_`` Then I will._<br/>`` Then I will.''

_Shall I go, Mrs. Allen?''_<br/>`` Shall I tell Brother Drebber?''

_`` Just as you please, my dear.''_<br/>`` Yes, my dear.''

_`` Mrs. Allen, you must persuade her to go,'' was the general cry._<br/>`` Why, Sadie,'' she remarked,`` I thought I heard you in the night, dear, and now I see that you have been crying.''

_Mrs. Allen was not inattentive to it:`` Well, my dear,'' said she,`` suppose you go.''_<br/>`` Your dear mother would not have liked it, Clara,'' said he.

_And in two minutes they were off._<br/>And now it is high time we were off.

_Catherine's feelings, as she got into the carriage, were in a very unsettled state; divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure, and the hope of soon enjoying another, almost its equal in degree, however unlike in kind._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_She could not think the Tilneys had acted quite well by her, in so readily giving up their engagement, without sending her any message of excuse._<br/>She could not forget the scrap of conversation which she had heard the night before, nor the secret which her sister had refused to confide to her.

_It was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk; and, in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour, she could not from her own observation help thinking that they might have gone with very little inconvenience._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_To feel herself slighted by them was very painful._<br/>`` Only a twist, I think; but it's pretty painful.

_On the other hand, the delight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho, as her fancy represented Blaize Castle to be, was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for almost anything._<br/>The height of the trees and the thickness of the boles exceeded anything which I in my town-bred life could have imagined, shooting upwards in magnificent columns until, at an enormous distance above our heads, we could dimly discern the spot where they threw out their side-branches into Gothic upward curves which coalesced to form one great matted roof of verdure, through which only an occasional golden ray of sunshine shot downwards to trace a thin dazzling line of light amidst the majestic obscurity.

_They passed briskly down Pulteney Street, and through Laura Place, without the exchange of many words._<br/> With these words he led the way out of the hall and paced slowly down Fore Street, the people falling back to right and to left as he passed, and raising their caps to do him reverence.

_Thorpe talked to his horse, and she meditated, by turns, on broken promises and broken arches, phaetons and false hangings, Tilneys and trap-doors._<br/>I had just fallen into a dream in which I saw Reuben Lockarby crowned King of England by Mistress Ruth Timewell, while Decimus Saxon endeavoured to shoot him with a bottle of Daffy's elixir, when in an instant, without warning, I was dashed violently from my horse, and left lying half-conscious on the stony track.

_As they entered Argyle Buildings, however, she was roused by this address from her companion,`` Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by?''_<br/>She carried herself in the most stately fashion, so that as I looked at her majestic entrance, and at the pose which she struck as she glanced at my father, I was reminded of the Queen of the Peruvians as, in the person of Miss Polly Hinton, she incited Boy Jim and myself to insurrection.

_`` Who?_<br/>`` Who's that?''

_Where?''_<br/>Where?''

_`` On the right-hand pavement-- she must be almost out of sight now.''_<br/>` We are off the main road now,' I remarked;` even should they pursue us, they would be unlikely to follow this side track.'

_Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother's arm, walking slowly down the street._<br/>I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers.

_She saw them both looking back at her._<br/>said she, looking out.

_`` Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe,'' she impatiently cried;`` it is Miss Tilney; it is indeed._<br/>`` You see, Clara,'' she cried,`` the charm works already.

_How could you tell me they were gone?_<br/>How could you get me out?'

_Stop, stop, I will get out this moment and go to them.''_<br/>`` I think, if you will have me, that I would rather go with you.''

_But to what purpose did she speak?_<br/>`` But what I do for you now?''

_Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot; the Tilneys, who had soon ceased to look after her, were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place, and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace._<br/> He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving.

_Still, however, and during the length of another street, she entreated him to stop._<br/>From time to time I turned and approached them, hoping to fall into conversation with them; but as I did so they would break and hasten down the road.

_`` Pray, pray stop, Mr. Thorpe._<br/>Pray do!''

_I can not go on._<br/>We ca n't go on like this.''

_I will not go on._<br/>`` I not leave you.

_I must go back to Miss Tilney.''_<br/>What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?''

_But Mr. Thorpe only laughed, smacked his whip, encouraged his horse, made odd noises, and drove on; and Catherine, angry and vexed as she was, having no power of getting away, was obliged to give up the point and submit._<br/> He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving.

_Her reproaches, however, were not spared._<br/>Nay, frown not, for I was but jesting.

_`` How could you deceive me so, Mr. Thorpe?_<br/>` Why should you deceive him?'

_How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road?_<br/>How could you hope to pass through the streets of the city?

_I would not have had it happen so for the world._<br/>I could not have believed it.

_They must think it so strange, so rude of me!_<br/>How you must hate and loathe me!

_To go by them, too, without saying a word!_<br/>` But why did you not tell me so?'

_You do not know how vexed I am; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton, nor in anything else._<br/>You would do well, Mr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an injury.''

_I had rather, ten thousand times rather, get out now, and walk back to them._<br/>I have but seen them this once in ten years, and it may be ten more, for all I know, ere I see them again.

_How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton?''_<br/>At last, breathless, speechless, I reached the phaeton.

_Thorpe defended himself very stoutly, declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life, and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself._<br/>They never took their wondering eyes off me as I told my story, and my heart swelled with pride when my uncle said that we had carried ourselves well, and that he did not think that many of our age would have stood it as stoutly.

_Their drive, even when this subject was over, was not likely to be very agreeable._<br/> It was not an easy question to answer, so I was silent.

_Catherine's complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former airing._<br/>There was no longer any chance of his having legitimate offspring.

_She listened reluctantly, and her replies were short._<br/>She spoke languidly and wearily.

_Blaize Castle remained her only comfort; towards that, she still looked at intervals with pleasure; though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk, and especially rather than be thought ill of by the Tilneys, she would willingly have given up all the happiness which its walls could supply-- the happiness of a progress through a long suite of lofty rooms, exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture, though now for many years deserted-- the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow, winding vaults, by a low, grated door; or even of having their lamp, their only lamp, extinguished by a sudden gust of wind, and of being left in total darkness._<br/>There we left him then in the dim-lit London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman, while without, at the edge of the Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with it, his victory, which confined Napoleon's ambition for ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.

_In the meanwhile, they proceeded on their journey without any mischance, and were within view of the town of Keynsham, when a halloo from Morland, who was behind them, made his friend pull up, to know what was the matter._<br/>I saw, too, that eccentricity was, as my uncle had told me, the fashion; and if the folk upon the Continent look upon us even to this day as being a nation of lunatics, it is no doubt a tradition handed down from the time when the only travellers whom they were likely to see were drawn from the class which I was now meeting.

_The others then came close enough for conversation, and Morland said,`` We had better go back, Thorpe; it is too late to go on today; your sister thinks so as well as I._<br/>But already, as I write, a week has passed, and we have had our momentous interview with Lord John Roxton and-- well, perhaps things might be worse.

_We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street, very little more than seven miles; and, I suppose, we have at least eight more to go._<br/>I find,'' he continued, glancing over the pages of his ledger,`` that within the last twelve months we have supplied no fewer than seven Latin masters to Willow Lea House Academy, four of them having left so abruptly as to forfeit their month's salary, and none of them having stayed more than eight weeks.''

_It will never do._<br/>I never could find them.

_We set out a great deal too late._<br/>`` We have gone through a great crisis.

_We had much better put it off till another day, and turn round.''_<br/>Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour.''

_`` It is all one to me,'' replied Thorpe rather angrily; and instantly turning his horse, they were on their way back to Bath._<br/>` With all humbleness, your Majesty,' said Lord Grey, who had just returned with the horse,' I should suggest, since there are only a few troops of their cavalry on this side of the Avon, that we blow up the bridge and move onwards to Bath, whence we can pass into Wiltshire, which we know to be friendly.'

_`` If your brother had not got such a d-- beast to drive,'' said he soon afterwards,`` we might have done it very well._<br/>` If we are indeed to be comrades,' said I sternly,` you must learn to speak with more reverence and less flippancy of my father, who would assuredly never have harboured you had he heard the tale which you have told me even now.'

_My horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour, if left to himself, and I have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken-winded jade's pace._<br/>To continue my story, however, which I broke off in order to step down from my horse, I found out early in the morning that ye were gone, and Zachary Palmer was able to tell me whither.

_Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own.''_<br/>Or, perhaps, finding that we are not with him, he may trust to the speed of his horse.'

_`` No, he is not,'' said Catherine warmly,`` for I am sure he could not afford it.''_<br/>`` No one who was not good could be so absolutely happy as she seems to be.

_`` And why can not he afford it?''_<br/>`` But why not settle it now?''

_`` Because he has not money enough.''_<br/>`` It's not so bad as we thought,'' said he,`` and yet it is bad enough.

_`` And whose fault is that?''_<br/>`` But the cause?''

_`` Nobody's, that I know of.''_<br/>`` No,'' said I.`` I know of none.''

_Thorpe then said something in the loud, incoherent way to which he had often recourse, about its being a d-- thing to be miserly; and that if people who rolled in money could not afford things, he did not know who could, which Catherine did not even endeavour to understand._<br/>It was not merely that his own fortunes were largely at stake, but it was the dreadful position in which he would stand before this immense concourse of people, many of whom had put their money upon his judgment, if he should find himself at the last moment with an impotent excuse instead of a champion to put before them.

_Disappointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment, she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so; and they returned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_As she entered the house, the footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off; that, when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe, the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her; and on his saying no, had felt for a card, but said she had none about her, and went away._<br/> She worked upon me so, partly with her scorn and partly with this money that she held before my eyes, that I believe I should have yielded and taken my chances upstairs, had it not been that I saw her eyes following the struggle within me in such a crafty, malignant fashion, that it was evident she was bent upon making me the tool of her revenge, and that she would leave me no choice but to do the old man an injury or to be captured by him.

_Pondering over these heart-rending tidings, Catherine walked slowly upstairs._<br/>At this she seemed somewhat hurt, and the tears sprang into her eyes, but she followed me into the sitting-room and watched me wistfully.

_At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen, who, on hearing the reason of their speedy return, said,`` I am glad your brother had so much sense; I am glad you are come back._<br/>On the other hand, I am bound to admit that she confidently prophesied the escape of her fourth brother, who was a prisoner in Germany, and that this was duly fulfilled.

_It was a strange, wild scheme.''_<br/>It was a glorious thought.

_They all spent the evening together at Thorpe's._<br/>`` Well, we did it at night.

_Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce, in the fate of which she shared, by private partnership with Morland, a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton._<br/>Beyond sighting a Barbary rover once, whereat our mariners were in sad distress, counting themselves already as little better than slaves, we had good luck until we had come within a hundred leagues of the Cape of Good Hope, when the wind veered round to the southward and blew exceeding hard, while the sea rose to such a height that the end of the mainyard dipped into the water, and I heard the master say that though he had been at sea for five-and-thirty years he had never seen the like of it, and that he had little expectation of riding through it.

_Her satisfaction, too, in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more than once._<br/>Their language is more than half signs, and it was not hard to follow them.

_`` How I pity the poor creatures that are going there!_<br/>Now, do you see the dreadful dilemma in which those poor people found themselves?

_How glad I am that I am not amongst them!_<br/>I am surprised that you did not see me.

_I wonder whether it will be a full ball or not!_<br/>Shall it end well or shall it not?

_They have not begun dancing yet._<br/>You have not yet began to practise it?''

_I would not be there for all the world._<br/>We can not have them all over the world.''

_It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself._<br/>It is very nice of you to call so early.

_I dare say it will not be a very good ball._<br/>`` I did not dare to think it.''

_I know the Mitchells will not be there._<br/>I know now that I can not have the use of it, and I know that they can not.

_I am sure I pity everybody that is._<br/>`` You will, I am sure, excuse us.

_But I dare say, Mr. Morland, you long to be at it, do not you?_<br/>I do not know why they should be so coupled, and they never were with Jim.

_I am sure you do._<br/>You meant well, I am sure.''

_Well, pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you._<br/>Oh, I do pray that you may not repent it!''

_I dare say we could do very well without you; but you men think yourselves of such consequence.''_<br/>I only say that it is impossible for you or any man to realise it.

_Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows, so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind, and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_`` Do not be so dull, my dearest creature,'' she whispered._<br/>I could not pass on and leave this poor soul in her distress.

_`` You will quite break my heart._<br/>You will have to break it open.

_It was amazingly shocking, to be sure; but the Tilneys were entirely to blame._<br/>It was bad enough to be compelled to have Madge in the house, but she was old and ugly, and could be ignored.

_Why were not they more punctual?_<br/>Why should you not have them?

_It was dirty, indeed, but what did that signify?_<br/>It was horrible-- but it was doocedly interestin' too.

_I am sure John and I should not have minded it._<br/>I'm sure I would n't either, if I were he.

_I never mind going through anything, where a friend is concerned; that is my disposition, and John is just the same; he has amazing strong feelings._<br/>I only know that he was a very great one, and that the things in which he dealt were also so great that it is impossible to judge him by any ordinary standard.

_Good heavens!_<br/>`` Good heavens!''

_What a delightful hand you have got!_<br/>`` So you've got them too!''

_Kings, I vow!_<br/>I repent!

_I never was so happy in my life!_<br/>I never was so happy in my life.''

_I would fifty times rather you should have them than myself.''_<br/>-- a hundred times I have said it.''

_And now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch, which is the true heroine's portion; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears._<br/> It was on the very night which succeeded the events which have just been narrated, when suddenly into Monica William's head, as she tossed upon her sleepless bed, there shot a thought which made her sit up with a thrill and a gasp.

_And lucky may she think herself, if she get another good night's rest in the course of the next three months._<br/>It would be kind of you, though, if you would look in at number one when you get back and tell my wife that all's well with me, and that I'll be back in an hour or so.''

_CHAPTER 12 `` Mrs. Allen,'' said Catherine the next morning,`` will there be any harm in my calling on Miss Tilney today?_<br/> There, sir, I have told you the whole story of the events which led up to the murder of Lord Mannering by his wife upon the night of September the 14th, in the year 1894.

_I shall not be easy till I have explained everything.''_<br/>I do not yet know what it is, but I am perfectly ready to do it.'

_`` Go, by all means, my dear; only put on a white gown; Miss Tilney always wears white.''_<br/> One other detail: On the left side of the skirt of the black dress was, as I thought at first, a shapeless bunch of white ribbon.

_Catherine cheerfully complied, and being properly equipped, was more impatient than ever to be at the pump-room, that she might inform herself of General Tilney's lodgings, for though she believed they were in Milsom Street, she was not certain of the house, and Mrs. Allen's wavering convictions only made it more doubtful._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_To Milsom Street she was directed, and having made herself perfect in the number, hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit, explain her conduct, and be forgiven; tripping lightly through the church-yard, and resolutely turning away her eyes, that she might not be obliged to see her beloved Isabella and her dear family, who, she had reason to believe, were in a shop hard by._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_She reached the house without any impediment, looked at the number, knocked at the door, and inquired for Miss Tilney._<br/>I would have left the room without another word, but he clung to me, and tore the ruffle from my wrist in his attempt to hold me back, and to prevail upon me to promise to say nothing to you or Sir Lothian Hume.

_The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home, but was not quite certain._<br/>He's not the same man he used to be, though I make free to say that he was never quite one of my gentlemen, like Mr. Hastie or yourself, sir.

_Would she be pleased to send up her name?_<br/>She will be glad to make your acquaintance.''

_She gave her card._<br/>She drew back her hands.

_In a few minutes the servant returned, and with a look which did not quite confirm his words, said he had been mistaken, for that Miss Tilney was walked out._<br/>Now that they had not only ceased to protect him, but had themselves become a source of trouble to him, he began to understand how great the blessing was which he had enjoyed, and to sigh for the happy days before his girls had come under the influence of his neighbor.

_Catherine, with a blush of mortification, left the house._<br/>I could only bow and leave the room, with a bitter sense of ill-usage at my heart.

_She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney was at home, and too much offended to admit her; and as she retired down the street, could not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows, in expectation of seeing her there, but no one appeared at them._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_At the bottom of the street, however, she looked back again, and then, not at a window, but issuing from the door, she saw Miss Tilney herself._<br/>I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street,` Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,' she cried.

_She was followed by a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be her father, and they turned up towards Edgar's Buildings._<br/>She had a commission from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed.

_Catherine, in deep mortification, proceeded on her way._<br/>She crimsoned with shame at her own baseness, as she turned once more to her companion.

_She could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility; but she checked the resentful sensation; she remembered her own ignorance._<br/>I could see that her remarks were as offensive to her father as they were to me, for he looked at her with eyes which were as angry as her own.

_She knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness, to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead, nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable._<br/>The lady came, not altogether with the approval of her husband, and though she never gave indications of any very great psychic force, we were able, at least, to obtain those usual phenomena of message-tilting which are at the same time so puerile and so inexplicable.

_Dejected and humbled, she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night; but it must be confessed that they were not of long continuance, for she soon recollected, in the first place, that she was without any excuse for staying at home; and, in the second, that it was a play she wanted very much to see._<br/> She worked upon me so, partly with her scorn and partly with this money that she held before my eyes, that I believe I should have yielded and taken my chances upstairs, had it not been that I saw her eyes following the struggle within me in such a crafty, malignant fashion, that it was evident she was bent upon making me the tool of her revenge, and that she would leave me no choice but to do the old man an injury or to be captured by him.

_To the theatre accordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her; she feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness for plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the London stage, which she knew, on Isabella's authority, rendered everything else of the kind`` quite horrid.''_<br/>She went on to say that the sphere she inhabited was all round the earth; that she knew about the planets; that Mars was inhabited by a race more advanced than us, and that the canals were artificial; there was no bodily pain in her sphere, but there could be mental anxiety; they were governed; they took nourishment; she had been a Catholic and was still a Catholic, but had not fared better than the Protestants; there were Buddhists and Mohammedans in her sphere, but all fared alike; she had never seen Christ and knew no more about Him than on earth, but believed in His influence; spirits prayed and they died in their new sphere before entering another; they had pleasures-- music was among them.

_She was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure; the comedy so well suspended her care that no one, observing her during the first four acts, would have supposed she had any wretchedness about her._<br/>He had not imagination enough to realise that the experience which seemed so appallingly important to him, was the merest everyday matter of business to the medical man who could not have lived for a year had he not, amid the rush of work, remembered what was due to his own health.

_On the beginning of the fifth, however, the sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father, joining a party in the opposite box, recalled her to anxiety and distress._<br/>But, then, Champion Harrison told me how the fighting-men lived there, and my father how the heads of the Navy lived there, and my mother how her brother and his grand friends were there, until at last I was consumed with impatience to see this marvellous heart of England.

_The stage could no longer excite genuine merriment-- no longer keep her whole attention._<br/>Thus when he tries to recall each stage of the journey he does so with the knowledge of its end, and can no longer make it clear, even to himself, how it may have seemed to him at the time.

_Every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box; and, for the space of two entire scenes, did she thus watch Henry Tilney, without being once able to catch his eye._<br/>And yet, when I knew that the fact was attested by three eye-witnesses, who were Lord Dunraven, Lord Lindsay, and Captain Wynne, all men of honour and repute, who were willing afterwards to take their oath upon it, I could not but admit that the evidence for this was more direct than for any of those far-off events which the whole world has agreed to accept as true.

_No longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play; his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes._<br/>Surely there is no situation which the mind of man could invent which has not taken shape and been played out upon the world stage.

_At length, however, he did look towards her, and he bowed-- but such a bow!_<br/>And then in an instant, as though she had said too much, she sprang to her feet and drew her mantle round her.

_No smile, no continued observance attended it; his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction._<br/>No one could entertain more charmingly than she, for she moved about among the people with her amiable smile, setting everybody at their ease by her kindly natural manner, and by the conviction which she gave them that she was thoroughly at her ease herself.

_Catherine was restlessly miserable; she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation._<br/>He hurried in, fearing that she might have taken some turn for the worse, but he was reassured to find her sitting up in her bed, with Clara and Ida Walker in attendance upon her.

_Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her; instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation-- instead of proudly resolving, in conscious innocence, to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it, to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation, and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight, or flirting with somebody else-- she took to herself all the shame of misconduct, or at least of its appearance, and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_The play concluded-- the curtain fell-- Henry Tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat, but his father remained, and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box._<br/> This was just before the end of the session; and soon after the holidays commenced, the professors who still remained in Birchespool were shocked to hear that their brother of the chair of physiology had sunk so low that no hopes could be entertained of his recovery.

_She was right; in a few minutes he appeared, and, making his way through the then thinning rows, spoke with like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her friend._<br/>He would talk, too, to his two daughters of her strength of character, her decisive mind, and of the necessity of their cultivating her acquaintance and following her example, until at last it had become his most common topic of conversation.

_Not with such calmness was he answered by the latter:`` Oh!_<br/>Oh, I trust he is not offended with me!

_Mr. Tilney, I have been quite wild to speak to you, and make my apologies._<br/>I have, according to our arrangement, addressed it to you, my dear Mr. McArdle, and I leave it to your discretion to delete, alter, or do what you like with it.

_You must have thought me so rude; but indeed it was not my own fault, was it, Mrs. Allen?_<br/>` You may think me ill-bred to say it, sir,' she remarked,` but I can not but marvel where you have been, or what you have done all your life.

_Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together?_<br/>I had determined to give you notice when we reached Brighton; but as we drove from the village that day, I caught a glimpse of a lady passing in a phaeton between whom and Lord Avon I was well aware there was a close intimacy, although I was not certain that she was actually his wife.

_And then what could I do?_<br/>what could I say, what could I do?

_But I had ten thousand times rather have been with you; now had not I, Mrs. Allen?''_<br/>I swear that they have not in mine, Though I am a year Short of sixty, my dear, And you are well, say thirty-nine.

_`` My dear, you tumble my gown,'' was Mrs. Allen's reply._<br/>`` My dear Clara,'' he cried,`` you have torn your skirt!''

_Her assurance, however, standing sole as it did, was not thrown away; it brought a more cordial, more natural smile into his countenance, and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve:`` We were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in Argyle Street: you were so kind as to look back on purpose.''_<br/> How far Mansoor may have gone with his assurances may never be known, but the Mussulman preacher came walking towards them at this moment with a paternal and contented smile upon his face, as one who has a pleasant and easy task before him.

_`` But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk; I never thought of such a thing; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop; I called out to him as soon as ever I saw you; now, Mrs. Allen, did not-- Oh!_<br/>` Well,' said she,` there are some who call him a usurper, and wish him all evil; but for my own part I have never heard of anything that he has said and done which was not great and noble.

_You were not there; but indeed I did; and, if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped, I would have jumped out and run after you.''_<br/>However, I could not turn and I could not stop, so there was nothing for it but to gallop on and to take my chance.

_Is there a Henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration?_<br/>`` How can you so far forget yourself, Mr. Stulpnagel,'' said he,`` as to jest in the presence of death?''

_Henry Tilney at least was not._<br/>Oh, Charles, you have not the heart!

_With a yet sweeter smile, he said everything that need be said of his sister's concern, regret, and dependence on Catherine's honour._<br/>`` That is one of the few professions which can not be improved,'' said Mrs. Westmacott, with her sweetest smile.

_`` Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_Do not say Miss Tilney was not angry,'' cried Catherine,`` because I know she was; for she would not see me this morning when I called; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it; I was hurt, but I was not affronted._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Perhaps you did not know I had been there.''_<br/>That I did not know.

_`` I was not within at the time; but I heard of it from Eleanor, and she has been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of such incivility; but perhaps I can do it as well._<br/>` Well,' said she,` there are some who call him a usurper, and wish him all evil; but for my own part I have never heard of anything that he has said and done which was not great and noble.

_It was nothing more than that my father-- they were just preparing to walk out, and he being hurried for time, and not caring to have it put off-- made a point of her being denied._<br/>There was nothing to encourage my ambition, for the only thing which I inherited from my father was a weak stomach.

_That was all, I do assure you._<br/>That is all that I can say.''

_She was very much vexed, and meant to make her apology as soon as possible.''_<br/>In her own eyes she was herself very plain, and she knew that her manner was often ungracious when she would most wish to be gracious.

_Catherine's mind was greatly eased by this information, yet a something of solicitude remained, from which sprang the following question, thoroughly artless in itself, though rather distressing to the gentleman:`` But, Mr. Tilney, why were you less generous than your sister?_<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_If she felt such confidence in my good intentions, and could suppose it to be only a mistake, why should you be so ready to take offence?''_<br/>`` If your friend,'' she said,`` would be good enough to stop, he might be of inestimable service to me.''

_`` Me!_<br/>`` Oh!

_I take offence!''_<br/>I have it!''

_`` Nay, I am sure by your look, when you came into the box, you were angry.''_<br/>`` That was to make you angry,'' said I. `` Well, I am angry,'' said he.

_`` I angry!_<br/> I felt more and more angry.

_I could have no right.''_<br/>but I could say no more.

_`` Well, nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face.''_<br/>`` I had no idea that you noticed that,'' he said.

_He replied by asking her to make room for him, and talking of the play._<br/>He is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter.

_He remained with them some time, and was only too agreeable for Catherine to be contented when he went away._<br/> I contented myself by answering that I was not, by which reticence I could see that I only excited his curiosity the more.

_Before they parted, however, it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible; and, setting aside the misery of his quitting their box, she was, upon the whole, left one of the happiest creatures in the world._<br/>And yet I felt happier than I had done since this crushing blow had fallen upon me, for it was good to think that the world should know what we had done, so that at the worst our names should not perish with our bodies, but should go down to posterity associated with the result of our labors.

_While talking to each other, she had observed with some surprise that John Thorpe, who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together, was engaged in conversation with General Tilney; and she felt something more than surprise when she thought she could perceive herself the object of their attention and discourse._<br/> I may have commented upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but never have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in Cornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and shards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his solution.

_What could they have to say of her?_<br/>What had you to do with her or with us?

_She feared General Tilney did not like her appearance: she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter, rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` How came Mr. Thorpe to know your father?''_<br/>What would your father say?

_was her anxious inquiry, as she pointed them out to her companion._<br/>she asked, with something appealing in her voice and expression.

_He knew nothing about it; but his father, like every military man, had a very large acquaintance._<br/>I have no doubt that something which he had said had put the thought into my father's head, and that the fiery nature of the man had done the rest.

_When the entertainment was over, Thorpe came to assist them in getting out._<br/>'`` Having got so far, let us inquire to what end the universe was made, and we put upon it.

_Catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry; and, while they waited in the lobby for a chair, he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue, by asking, in a consequential manner, whether she had seen him talking with General Tilney:`` He is a fine old fellow, upon my soul!_<br/>If, for example, our only knowledge of unknown forces depended upon the researches of Dr. Crawford of Belfast, who places his amateur medium in a weighing chair with her feet from the ground, and has been able to register a difference of weight of many pounds, corresponding with the physical phenomena produced, a result which he has tested and recorded in a true scientific spirit of caution, I do not see how it could be shaken.

_Stout, active-- looks as young as his son._<br/>There's Belcher's young brother, Tom.

_I have a great regard for him, I assure you: a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived.''_<br/>For my own part, if I were only assured that I was as clever and brave as the average man about me, I should be well satisfied.

_`` But how came you to know him?''_<br/> But how was I to do it?

_`` Know him!_<br/>`` That's him!''

_There are few people much about town that I do not know._<br/>` There are some trades that had best not even be spoken about.'

_I have met him forever at the Bedford; and I knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard-room._<br/>I left him here last night, and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs.''

_One of the best players we have, by the by; and we had a little touch together, though I was almost afraid of him at first: the odds were five to four against me; and, if I had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world-- I took his ball exactly-- but I could not make you understand it without a table; however, I did beat him._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_A very fine fellow; as rich as a Jew._<br/>A fine leader truly for a godly cause!

_I should like to dine with him; I dare say he gives famous dinners._<br/>Him I took to be the landlord, and I asked him what I should have for my dinner.

_But what do you think we have been talking of?_<br/>`` What were we talking about?''

_You._<br/>You!''

_Yes, by heavens!_<br/>`` Good heavens!''

_And the general thinks you the finest girl in Bath.''_<br/>Then she walked back into the house, the happiest girl in all Utah.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Nonsense!_<br/>Nonsense!

_How can you say so?''_<br/>How could you possibly know?

_`` And what do you think I said?''_<br/>`` Well, what do you think of that?''

_-- lowering his voice--`` well done, general, said I; I am quite of your mind.''_<br/>`` Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence.

_Here Catherine, who was much less gratified by his admiration than by General Tilney's, was not sorry to be called away by Mr. Allen._<br/>''` Nay, take it not to heart, bold Allen,' exclaimed their leader, who was none other than the great Jack Cade himself.

_Thorpe, however, would see her to her chair, and, till she entered it, continued the same kind of delicate flattery, in spite of her entreating him to have done._<br/>Then at last I would speak, and she would start in her chair and stare at me with the most admirable pretence of being surprised to find me in the room.

_That General Tilney, instead of disliking, should admire her, was very delightful; and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom she need now fear to meet._<br/> Reuben had said not a word since she had uncovered her face, and bore the face of a man who finds himself in some pleasant dream and is vexed only by the fear lest he wake up from it.

_The evening had done more, much more, for her than could have been expected._<br/>We were all taking the matter much more seriously than we had ever done before.

_CHAPTER 13  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have now passed in review before the reader; the events of each day, its hopes and fears, mortifications and pleasures, have been separately stated, and the pangs of Sunday only now remain to be described, and close the week._<br/> Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace.

_The Clifton scheme had been deferred, not relinquished, and on the afternoon's crescent of this day, it was brought forward again._<br/>It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our cottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds back to the matter in hand.

_In a private consultation between Isabella and James, the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going, and the latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her, it was agreed that, provided the weather were fair, the party should take place on the following morning; and they were to set off very early, in order to be at home in good time._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The affair thus determined, and Thorpe's approbation secured, Catherine only remained to be apprised of it._<br/>I instantly communicated with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share.

_She had left them for a few minutes to speak to Miss Tilney._<br/>said she; and was gone ere I could say a word in answer to her extraordinary request.

_In that interval the plan was completed, and as soon as she came again, her agreement was demanded; but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by Isabella, Catherine looked grave, was very sorry, but could not go._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The engagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for her to accompany them now._<br/>What did it matter to me if she hated the sound of his voice, or if he put every indignity upon her in the hope of breaking her spirit, and spoke to her as he would never have dared to speak to one of his servants?

_She had that moment settled with Miss Tilney to take their proposed walk tomorrow; it was quite determined, and she would not, upon any account, retract._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_But that she must and should retract was instantly the eager cry of both the Thorpes; they must go to Clifton tomorrow, they would not go without her, it would be nothing to put off a mere walk for one day longer, and they would not hear of a refusal._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Catherine was distressed, but not subdued._<br/>It was ingenious, but not convincing.

_`` Do not urge me, Isabella._<br/>Do not hesitate to summon me.''

_I am engaged to Miss Tilney._<br/>`` I like you, my dear, and I am going to call you Clara.

_I can not go.''_<br/>`` I can not understand you.

_This availed nothing._<br/>It is nothing.

_The same arguments assailed her again; she must go, she should go, and they would not hear of a refusal._<br/>The most that she would concede was that she would not openly interfere with anything which her companions might say or do.

_`` It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement, and must only beg to put off the walk till Tuesday.''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` No, it would not be easy._<br/>`` No, it certainly is not.''

_I could not do it._<br/>I could not believe it.

_There has been no prior engagement.''_<br/>There has been no better case within my recollection.

_But Isabella became only more and more urgent, calling on her in the most affectionate manner, addressing her by the most endearing names._<br/>Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand.

_She was sure her dearest, sweetest Catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly._<br/>For my own part I was not so very anxious that she should save this craven lover of hers, whose handsome face belied the poor spirit within him.

_She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart, so sweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those she loved._<br/>To her child's heart it seemed incomprehensible,-- and yet she understood that it was sweet and beautiful also.

_But all in vain; Catherine felt herself to be in the right, and though pained by such tender, such flattering supplication, could not allow it to influence her._<br/>And yet she did not like this secrecy, this disinclination upon the part of one so frank and honest as Ida to tell her what was passing.

_Isabella then tried another method._<br/>I know because I have tried.''

_She reproached her with having more affection for Miss Tilney, though she had known her so little a while, than for her best and oldest friends, with being grown cold and indifferent, in short, towards herself._<br/>And she, the polluted one, had risen to the dignity, had cut herself sternly away from all that related to her past life, and had shown signs already of being a great Queen, stronger and wiser than her husband, but fierce, vindictive, and unbending, a firm support to her friends, but a terror to her foes.

_`` I can not help being jealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who love you so excessively!_<br/>You are not as aggressive as I should wish, Clara, but still I like you very much.

_When once my affections are placed, it is not in the power of anything to change them._<br/>It was not the first time, my friends, as you are well aware, and you know the reasons that I had to trust that neither nerve nor judgment would ever fail me.

_But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody's; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick, I own._<br/>And yet I felt happier than I had done since this crushing blow had fallen upon me, for it was good to think that the world should know what we had done, so that at the worst our names should not perish with our bodies, but should go down to posterity associated with the result of our labors.

_These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else.''_<br/>I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else.

_Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind._<br/>`` It was foolish of me to faint.

_Was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others?_<br/>Maybe it's the want of a friend that has driven her to this.''

_Isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish, regardless of everything but her own gratification._<br/>In her own eyes she was herself very plain, and she knew that her manner was often ungracious when she would most wish to be gracious.

_These painful ideas crossed her mind, though she said nothing._<br/>` It's quite irregular, and he must go,' said I.` It's that or nothing,' said she.'

_Isabella, in the meanwhile, had applied her handkerchief to her eyes; and Morland, miserable at such a sight, could not help saying,`` Nay, Catherine._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_I think you can not stand out any longer now._<br/>Surely you will not withhold it any longer.''

_The sacrifice is not much; and to oblige such a friend-- I shall think you quite unkind, if you still refuse.''_<br/>It was not the first time, my friends, as you are well aware, and you know the reasons that I had to trust that neither nerve nor judgment would ever fail me.

_This was the first time of her brother's openly siding against her, and anxious to avoid his displeasure, she proposed a compromise._<br/> My uncle was exceedingly anxious to know what I was about to do, but my fears of raising false hopes prevented me from telling him.

_If they would only put off their scheme till Tuesday, which they might easily do, as it depended only on themselves, she could go with them, and everybody might then be satisfied._<br/>Suppose that I got clear away, she would be in their hands until I could come back with help, for single-handed I could not hope to clear a way for her.

_But`` No, no, no!''_<br/>No, no.

_was the immediate answer;`` that could not be, for Thorpe did not know that he might not go to town on Tuesday.''_<br/>From that time I have never heard him allude to the matter, nor did he ever give us any reason why he should so confidently have expected the second coming upon that particular night.

_Catherine was sorry, but could do no more; and a short silence ensued, which was broken by Isabella, who in a voice of cold resentment said,`` Very well, then there is an end of the party._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_If Catherine does not go, I can not._<br/>If he does not start at once I must go without him.

_I can not be the only woman._<br/>But she must not think of herself.

_I would not, upon any account in the world, do so improper a thing.''_<br/>I would not believe them, I _ could _ not believe them-- for I did not know that there was upon this earth a thing so contemptible.

_`` Catherine, you must go,'' said James._<br/>`` I shall go with you, James,'' she said.

_`` But why can not Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters?_<br/>`` Why should he not take your mother with him?''

_I dare say either of them would like to go.''_<br/>`` I did not dare to think it.''

_`` Thank ye,'' cried Thorpe,`` but I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about, and look like a fool._<br/> I need not tell you how my dear mother wept over me and fondled me, for you who have mothers will know for yourselves, and you who have not will never understand how warm and snug the home nest can be.

_No, if you do not go, d-- me if I do._<br/>No; why should I?''

_I only go for the sake of driving you.''_<br/>I could only think of one way of doing it.

_`` That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure.''_<br/>`` There is no time like the present.

_But her words were lost on Thorpe, who had turned abruptly away._<br/>` But I fear that your pains have been thrown away.

_The three others still continued together, walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor Catherine; sometimes not a word was said, sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches, and her arm was still linked within Isabella's, though their hearts were at war._<br/> It was not easy for us to observe anything at the time, however, for we were ourselves in the midst of the frantic crowd, swaying about and carried occasionally quite off our feet, but endeavouring to keep our places behind Jackson and Berkeley Craven, who, with sticks and whips meeting over their heads, were still calling the rounds and superintending the fight.

_At one moment she was softened, at another irritated; always distressed, but always steady._<br/>At the same time I was conscious of a strained feeling of expectancy which was almost painful.

_`` I did not think you had been so obstinate, Catherine,'' said James;`` you were not used to be so hard to persuade; you once were the kindest, best-tempered of my sisters.''_<br/>` Well,' said she,` there are some who call him a usurper, and wish him all evil; but for my own part I have never heard of anything that he has said and done which was not great and noble.

_`` I hope I am not less so now,'' she replied, very feelingly;`` but indeed I can not go._<br/>`` Here I am,'' I answered, but they did not seem to hear me.

_If I am wrong, I am doing what I believe to be right.''_<br/>But I know I am right.

_`` I suspect,'' said Isabella, in a low voice,`` there is no great struggle.''_<br/>`` I dare say there is no such very great difficulty over that,'' said Monsieur Fardet, with a wink at the American.

_Catherine's heart swelled; she drew away her arm, and Isabella made no opposition._<br/> My whole soul rose against the injustice of it, and yet I had no appeal and no redress.

_Thus passed a long ten minutes, till they were again joined by Thorpe, who, coming to them with a gayer look, said,`` Well, I have settled the matter, and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe conscience._<br/>Why, it is but twenty minutes since I had the letter, Clara, and it seems to me to be some old, old thing which happened far away in my past life, some horrid black cloud which shut out all the freshness and the peace from it.''

_I have been to Miss Tilney, and made your excuses.''_<br/>`` You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,'' he remarked, airily.

_`` You have not!''_<br/>`` Can it not!''

_cried Catherine._<br/>Mary cried.

_`` I have, upon my soul._<br/>`` But you must-- you, with your beauty, with your soul!

_Left her this moment._<br/>The she.

_Told her you had sent me to say that, having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us tomorrow, you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday._<br/>I could imagine few more unlikely things than that the war should roll back to the Piave, and I could not think how any military event of consequence could arise there, but none the less I was so impressed that I drew up a statement that some such event would occur there, and I had it signed by my secretary and witnessed by my wife with the date, April 4th, attached.

_She said very well, Tuesday was just as convenient to her; so there is an end of all our difficulties._<br/>She began to praise you, I said what I felt, and then in an instant it was all out.''

_A pretty good thought of mine-- hey?''_<br/>`` That's a good guess,'' said he.

_Isabella's countenance was once more all smiles and good humour, and James too looked happy again._<br/>`` Yes, he looks happy, mother,'' he repeated, with a chuckle.

_`` A most heavenly thought indeed!_<br/>`` Remarkable-- most remarkable!''

_Now, my sweet Catherine, all our distresses are over; you are honourably acquitted, and we shall have a most delightful party.''_<br/>All of this is surely tidings of great joy, and I repeat that it is not a vague faith or hope, but that it is supported by all the laws of evidence which agree that where many independent witnesses give a similar account, that account has a claim to be considered a true one.

_`` This will not do,'' said Catherine;`` I can not submit to this._<br/>`` Yes, yes; I admit I can not explain them.''

_I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set her right.''_<br/>I should have turned and run away if I had had the strength, but I could only just stand and stare at her.

_Isabella, however, caught hold of one hand, Thorpe of the other, and remonstrances poured in from all three._<br/> There can be grace and courtesy as well as defiance in a bow; I put all three into this one, with a touch of ridicule in the shrug which accompanied it.

_Even James was quite angry._<br/>Challenger was very much annoyed.

_When everything was settled, when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday would suit her as well, it was quite ridiculous, quite absurd, to make any further objection._<br/>It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that at least she might never feel destitute.''

_`` I do not care._<br/>`` I do not care how I look.

_Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message._<br/>` There is no need for you to meddle in the business.

_If I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to Miss Tilney myself._<br/>Miss Hinton has told me of it, until I feel as if I could find my way through it from end to end.

_This is only doing it in a ruder way; and how do I know that Mr. Thorpe has-- He may be mistaken again perhaps; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday._<br/>To this day I do not know whether we were deceived, or whether there was some mistake in the name of the place; but there are the facts, and I was so disgusted that for some time my interest in the whole subject waned.

_Let me go, Mr. Thorpe; Isabella, do not hold me.''_<br/>But I must go, Clara, I must not seem to shirk.

_Thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys; they were turning the corner into Brock Street, when he had overtaken them, and were at home by this time._<br/>`` Later, when I descended to order the car and found Austin bending over it absorbed in repairs, I controlled my open hand even after I had lifted it and refrained from giving him an experience which would possibly have caused him to follow in the steps of the housekeeper.

_`` Then I will go after them,'' said Catherine;`` wherever they are I will go after them._<br/>`` If you'll let one out it's just what I have come for,'' said I. `` Go on!''

_It does not signify talking._<br/>`` It does not really matter.

_If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it.''_<br/>I never said anything, and I tried not to make myself ridiculous.

_And with these words she broke away and hurried off._<br/>Then we fell upon him and dragged him away.

_Thorpe would have darted after her, but Morland withheld him._<br/>Smith saw it, and he could have knocked him down for it.

_`` Let her go, let her go, if she will go._<br/>Let me go, I say!''

_She is as obstinate as--''  Thorpe never finished the simile, for it could hardly have been a proper one._<br/>` Well,' said she,` there are some who call him a usurper, and wish him all evil; but for my own part I have never heard of anything that he has said and done which was not great and noble.

_Away walked Catherine in great agitation, as fast as the crowd would permit her, fearful of being pursued, yet determined to persevere._<br/> Von Hartmann's indignation at this fresh attack upon him was so great that he became speechless for a minute from rage, and could only glare and shake his fists, while he struggled in her embrace.

_As she walked, she reflected on what had passed._<br/>She spoke just now as if she had mentioned the plan which I had conceived to you.

_It was painful to her to disappoint and displease them, particularly to displease her brother; but she could not repent her resistance._<br/>This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate it.''

_Setting her own inclination apart, to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney, to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before, and on a false pretence too, must have been wrong._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_She had not been withstanding them on selfish principles alone, she had not consulted merely her own gratification; that might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, she had attended to what was due to others, and to her own character in their opinion._<br/>She went on to say that the sphere she inhabited was all round the earth; that she knew about the planets; that Mars was inhabited by a race more advanced than us, and that the canals were artificial; there was no bodily pain in her sphere, but there could be mental anxiety; they were governed; they took nourishment; she had been a Catholic and was still a Catholic, but had not fared better than the Protestants; there were Buddhists and Mohammedans in her sphere, but all fared alike; she had never seen Christ and knew no more about Him than on earth, but believed in His influence; spirits prayed and they died in their new sphere before entering another; they had pleasures-- music was among them.

_Her conviction of being right, however, was not enough to restore her composure; till she had spoken to Miss Tilney she could not be at ease; and quickening her pace when she got clear of the Crescent, she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of Milsom Street._<br/>She went on to say that the sphere she inhabited was all round the earth; that she knew about the planets; that Mars was inhabited by a race more advanced than us, and that the canals were artificial; there was no bodily pain in her sphere, but there could be mental anxiety; they were governed; they took nourishment; she had been a Catholic and was still a Catholic, but had not fared better than the Protestants; there were Buddhists and Mohammedans in her sphere, but all fared alike; she had never seen Christ and knew no more about Him than on earth, but believed in His influence; spirits prayed and they died in their new sphere before entering another; they had pleasures-- music was among them.

_So rapid had been her movements that in spite of the Tilneys' advantage in the outset, they were but just turning into their lodgings as she came within view of them; and the servant still remaining at the open door, she used only the ceremony of saying that she must speak with Miss Tilney that moment, and hurrying by him proceeded upstairs._<br/>There was something in the gentleness of his rebuke, and in his appeal to her mother, which brought the tears to her eyes, and in another instant she would have been kneeling beside him with everything confessed, when the door flew open and her sister Ida came bounding into the room.

_Then, opening the first door before her, which happened to be the right, she immediately found herself in the drawing-room with General Tilney, his son, and daughter._<br/>He was married to the second daughter of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir Lothian's descendants have their eye upon the property, they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them.

_Her explanation, defective only in being-- from her irritation of nerves and shortness of breath-- no explanation at all, was instantly given._<br/>It is my belief that she is merely stunned, and that she is in no danger at all.''

_`` I am come in a great hurry-- It was all a mistake-- I never promised to go-- I told them from the first I could not go._<br/>`` I am as glad to see you as ever I was to see a man in my life, but I confess that I did not expect you.''

_-- I ran away in a great hurry to explain it._<br/>He ran towards me in his eagerness when he saw me come out from the door.

_-- I did not care what you thought of me._<br/>I do not know what to make of it.''

_-- I would not stay for the servant.''_<br/>He would not make a fit partner for me.''

_The business, however, though not perfectly elucidated by this speech, soon ceased to be a puzzle._<br/>`` I need not say that any publicity given to such an idea-- any levity in your narrative of what occurred-- would be exceedingly offensive to me.''

_Catherine found that John Thorpe had given the message; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it._<br/>I had expected to find my Cousin Sibylle there, but to my surprise there was no sign of her, nor had she left any word to tell us whither she had gone.

_But whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment, Catherine, though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication, had no means of knowing._<br/>` Now, sir,' she continued,' I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative.

_Whatever might have been felt before her arrival, her eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire._<br/>What I wanted to say is that if you would like to have a second opinion I shall be very glad to meet any one whom you might suggest.''

_The affair thus happily settled, she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father, and received by him with such ready, such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe's information to her mind, and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on._<br/>`` Come, come, my dear lady,'' said he,`` you speak vastly beyond my merits;'' upon which encouragement she started again in a theatrical apostrophe to Britain's darling and Neptune's eldest son, which he endured with the same signs of gratitude and pleasure.

_To such anxious attention was the general's civility carried, that not aware of her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the apartment herself._<br/>Extricating himself with some difficulty from his unpleasant position, Von Hartmann gave an inarticulate yell of fury, and dashing out of the room, in spite of the entreaties of Elise, he seized his hat and rushed off into the town, all dripping and dishevelled, with the intention of seeking in some inn the food and comfort which he could not find at home.

_`` What did William mean by it?_<br/>What did he do?

_He should make a point of inquiring into the matter.''_<br/>`` You can consider the matter settled.

_And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence, it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of his master forever, if not his place, by her rapidity._<br/>`` If my gracious master-- the ever-glorious Emperor Justinian-- does not disdain to take me into his most intimate confidence in all things, it would be strange if there were any subject within your knowledge which I might not hear.

_After sitting with them a quarter of an hour, she rose to take leave, and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney's asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her._<br/> That night, wearied as I was after the wonderful happenings of the day, I sat late with McArdle, the news editor, explaining to him the whole situation, which he thought important enough to bring next morning before the notice of Sir George Beaumont, the chief.

_Miss Tilney added her own wishes._<br/>Miss Thurston was her name.

_Catherine was greatly obliged; but it was quite out of her power._<br/>She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.''

_Mr. and Mrs. Allen would expect her back every moment._<br/>Through all her life she would think of him-- she would know.

_The general declared he could say no more; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded; but on some other day he trusted, when longer notice could be given, they would not refuse to spare her to her friend._<br/>This I concealed where no one has ever discovered it; but my fears would not allow me to go back for the other, as I might perhaps have done, had I foreseen how terribly its presence might tell against my master.

_`` Oh, no; Catherine was sure they would not have the least objection, and she should have great pleasure in coming.''_<br/>`` And no one who has not lived with her and known her intimately can tell how charming and good she is.

_The general attended her himself to the street-door, saying everything gallant as they went downstairs, admiring the elasticity of her walk, which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing, and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld, when they parted._<br/>She was modern to the soles of her dainty little high-heeled shoes, frankly fond of dress and of pleasure, devoted to tennis and to comic opera, delighted with a dance, which came her way only too seldom, longing ever for some new excitement, and yet behind all this lighter side of her character a thoroughly good, healthy-minded English girl, the life and soul of the house, and the idol of her sister and her father.

_Catherine, delighted by all that had passed, proceeded gaily to Pulteney Street, walking, as she concluded, with great elasticity, though she had never thought of it before._<br/> How far Mansoor may have gone with his assurances may never be known, but the Mussulman preacher came walking towards them at this moment with a paternal and contented smile upon his face, as one who has a pleasant and easy task before him.

_She reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party; and now that she had been triumphant throughout, had carried her point, and was secure of her walk, she began-LRB- as the flutter of her spirits subsided-RRB- to doubt whether she had been perfectly right._<br/>She went on to say that the sphere she inhabited was all round the earth; that she knew about the planets; that Mars was inhabited by a race more advanced than us, and that the canals were artificial; there was no bodily pain in her sphere, but there could be mental anxiety; they were governed; they took nourishment; she had been a Catholic and was still a Catholic, but had not fared better than the Protestants; there were Buddhists and Mohammedans in her sphere, but all fared alike; she had never seen Christ and knew no more about Him than on earth, but believed in His influence; spirits prayed and they died in their new sphere before entering another; they had pleasures-- music was among them.

_A sacrifice was always noble; and if she had given way to their entreaties, she should have been spared the distressing idea of a friend displeased, a brother angry, and a scheme of great happiness to both destroyed, perhaps through her means._<br/>And she, the polluted one, had risen to the dignity, had cut herself sternly away from all that related to her past life, and had shown signs already of being a great Queen, stronger and wiser than her husband, but fierce, vindictive, and unbending, a firm support to her friends, but a terror to her foes.

_To ease her mind, and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct had really been, she took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the half-settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the following day._<br/>His experience had been the same as my own, and he was eager to see Captain Barrington; and to ascertain why he had directed his brother to return the money to us.

_Mr. Allen caught at it directly._<br/>Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with him.

_`` Well,'' said he,`` and do you think of going too?''_<br/>Oh, why would he do it?

_`` No; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it; and therefore you know I could not go with them, could I?''_<br/>`` No doubt we had, but I beg you wo n't try to drag me into the matter, Mr. Holmes.

_`` No, certainly not; and I am glad you do not think of it._<br/>`` No, I hardly think so.

_These schemes are not at all the thing._<br/>That is not so at all.

_Young men and women driving about the country in open carriages!_<br/>From every side men, women, and children were rushing wildly for shelter, swarming up the staircases and into the caves in a mad stampede.

_Now and then it is very well; but going to inns and public places together!_<br/>If we are going to work this thing, we may as well work it well.

_It is not right; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it._<br/>It is not much, but I can do it well.'

_I am glad you do not think of going; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased._<br/>I am surprised that you did not see me.

_Mrs. Allen, are not you of my way of thinking?_<br/>You are my Gladys, are you not-- little Gladys Hungerton?''

_Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable?''_<br/>Do you not think it possible that it might have an entirely different result?

_`` Yes, very much so indeed._<br/>`` Yes, that is so.''

_Open carriages are nasty things._<br/>The atmosphere was poisonous and horrible.

_A clean gown is not five minutes' wear in them._<br/>The creature has not passed ten minutes.

_You are splashed getting in and getting out; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction._<br/>Astonished at the sight, I leaned forward to pick it off, when, to my horror, it burst between my finger and thumb, squirting blood in every direction.

_I hate an open carriage myself.''_<br/>How you must hate and loathe me!

_`` I know you do; but that is not the question._<br/>`` I do not know.''

_Do not you think it has an odd appearance, if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men, to whom they are not even related?''_<br/>Why, I suppose of all the men you meet upon` Change, there is not one who has not some such story to tell.

_`` Yes, my dear, a very odd appearance indeed._<br/>`` Yes, my dear.''

_I can not bear to see it.''_<br/>I can not ask you to share it.''

_`` Dear madam,'' cried Catherine,`` then why did not you tell me so before?_<br/>`` My dear Mrs. Westmacott,'' cried Clara,`` I assure you that I have not the least idea what it is that you are talking of.''

_I am sure if I had known it to be improper, I would not have gone with Mr. Thorpe at all; but I always hoped you would tell me, if you thought I was doing wrong.''_<br/>I would have taken you into my confidence, Charles, had it not been that your suspicions had wounded me deeply-- for I did not at that time understand how strong the reasons were which had prejudiced you against me.

_`` And so I should, my dear, you may depend on it; for as I told Mrs. Morland at parting, I would always do the best for you in my power._<br/>`` Well,'' said Mr. Lumsden, with some hesitation,`` I hope that your temper is really as good as you say, for I rather fancy that you may need it.''

_But one must not be over particular._<br/>You should not be here.

_Young people will be young people, as your good mother says herself._<br/>What would our blessed mother have said could she have seen it?

_You know I wanted you, when we first came, not to buy that sprigged muslin, but you would._<br/>`` Would that I could have been the first to pay him homage, but it would not be wise for me to go.

_Young people do not like to be always thwarted.''_<br/>` They do not think it hopeless, nor do we.'

_`` But this was something of real consequence; and I do not think you would have found me hard to persuade.''_<br/> I knew that it was not so, but how could I bring myself to tell her?

_`` As far as it has gone hitherto, there is no harm done,'' said Mr. Allen;`` and I would only advise you, my dear, not to go out with Mr. Thorpe any more.''_<br/> So much Smith could not avoid hearing, but he hurried on, for he had no wish to be involved in their dispute.

_`` That is just what I was going to say,'' added his wife._<br/> It was heavenly for Johnson to have something to do and to feel that he was of some use to his wife.

_Catherine, relieved for herself, felt uneasy for Isabella, and after a moment's thought, asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe, and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself; for she considered that Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day, in spite of what had passed._<br/>` Madam,-- I would not take the boldness of writing to your Majesty till I had shown the King how I do abhor the thing that I have done, and how much I desire to live to serve him.

_Mr. Allen, however, discouraged her from doing any such thing._<br/>Indeed, nothing but my mother's good name for orthodoxy prevented him from insisting upon my dismissal.

_`` You had better leave her alone, my dear; she is old enough to know what she is about, and if not, has a mother to advise her._<br/>`` But women were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.''

_Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt; but, however, you had better not interfere._<br/>It is true that we had made a strict resolution against firing, but if it seemed to them that I might be in danger they would not hesitate.

_She and your brother choose to go, and you will be only getting ill will.''_<br/>`` I should wish Ida to be my sister, and you my wife.''

_Catherine submitted, and though sorry to think that Isabella should be doing wrong, felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen's approbation of her own conduct, and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error herself._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_Her escape from being one of the party to Clifton was now an escape indeed; for what would the Tilneys have thought of her, if she had broken her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself, if she had been guilty of one breach of propriety, only to enable her to be guilty of another?_<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_CHAPTER 14  The next morning was fair, and Catherine almost expected another attack from the assembled party._<br/>  Chapter V  The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge  It was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our night's adventures.

_With Mr. Allen to support her, she felt no dread of the event: but she would gladly be spared a contest, where victory itself was painful, and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them._<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_The Tilneys called for her at the appointed time; and no new difficulty arising, no sudden recollection, no unexpected summons, no impertinent intrusion to disconcert their measures, my heroine was most unnaturally able to fulfil her engagement, though it was made with the hero himself._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_They determined on walking round Beechen Cliff, that noble hill whose beautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object from almost every opening in Bath._<br/>Again, he might walk in the physic gardens of St. James's, or go down the river with the ebb tide to the cherry orchards at Rotherhithe, or drive to Islington to drink the cream, or, above all, walk in the Park, which is most modish for a gentleman who dresses in the fashion.

_`` I never look at it,'' said Catherine, as they walked along the side of the river,`` without thinking of the south of France.''_<br/>' I thank the Lord that I have never been so far tempted from the straight path as to set foot within one,' the Puritan answered,` nor have I ever been in that great sewer which is called London.

_`` You have been abroad then?''_<br/>` You have been over there?'

_said Henry, a little surprised._<br/>cried he, much excited.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_No, I only mean what I have read about._<br/>No, only two, I think.

_It always puts me in mind of the country that Emily and her father travelled through, in The Mysteries of Udolpho._<br/>She carried herself in the most stately fashion, so that as I looked at her majestic entrance, and at the pose which she struck as she glanced at my father, I was reminded of the Queen of the Peruvians as, in the person of Miss Polly Hinton, she incited Boy Jim and myself to insurrection.

_But you never read novels, I dare say?''_<br/>And perhaps you never heard the name before?''

_`` Why not?''_<br/>`` Why not?''

_`` Because they are not clever enough for you-- gentlemen read better books.''_<br/>`` I'm not clever enough or slow enough for their Z-Z fashions,'' said he.

_`` The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid._<br/>`` You have a kind face, Etienne,'' said she;`` you would not condemn this poor man to certain death.

_I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe's works, and most of them with great pleasure._<br/>I studied you all, therefore, and I have come to the conclusion that you are the one who is most suited for my purpose.''

_The Mysteries of Udolpho, when I had once begun it, I could not lay down again; I remember finishing it in two days-- my hair standing on end the whole time.''_<br/>When I thought of all my efforts in Abyssinia, of the length of my journey and of the dangers and fatigues which I had endured, I could not bear to think of this total disaster coming upon me at the last instant and robbing me not only of my profits, but also of my original outlay.

_`` Yes,'' added Miss Tilney,`` and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me, and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note, instead of waiting for me, you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk, and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it.''_<br/> Having got so far, Defoe remarked that he thought he had given them a fair start, and handed over the story to Dean Swift, who, after premising that he feared he would find himself as much at sea as Master Cyprian Overbeck Wells, continued in this way:-- `` For two days I drifted about in great distress, fearing that there should be a return of the gale, and keeping an eager look-out for my late companions.

_`` Thank you, Eleanor-- a most honourable testimony._<br/>`` Dear me, Mr. Malone, this is very-- very exalted.

_You see, Miss Morland, the injustice of your suspicions._<br/>I could see from Miss Morstan's manner that she was suffering from the same feeling.

_Here was I, in my eagerness to get on, refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister, breaking the promise I had made of reading it aloud, and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part, by running away with the volume, which, you are to observe, was her own, particularly her own._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_I am proud when I reflect on it, and I think it must establish me in your good opinion.''_<br/>` And I'm proud of the ridgment,' say I.' A damned good answer too!'

_`` I am very glad to hear it indeed, and now I shall never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself._<br/>`` I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself.

_But I really thought before, young men despised novels amazingly.''_<br/>Yes, in very truth he is a young man, and hath much life in him and much strength.

_`` It is amazingly; it may well suggest amazement if they do-- for they read nearly as many as women._<br/>`` Oh, I have done a little sailoring myself-- as much as a woman can aspire to, you know.

_I myself have read hundreds and hundreds._<br/>I took him in thousands, and here I am.''

_Do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias and Louisas._<br/>Do not wait longer, kind friend, or you may find yourself in trouble.'

_If we proceed to particulars, and engage in the never-ceasing inquiry of` Have you read this?'_<br/>Thus, in the cross-correspondence experiments we continually have them asking,`` Did you get that?''

_and` Have you read that?'_<br/>Have you read up the case?''

_I shall soon leave you as far behind me as-- what shall I say?_<br/>And now I must leave ye, for I have much to do.

_-- I want an appropriate simile._<br/>`` I wanted to have a word.

_-- as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when she went with her aunt into Italy._<br/>Then came the day when your mother's kindness-- her mistaken kindness-- gave you the means of escaping to London.''

_Consider how many years I have had the start of you._<br/>I should think that you have a full two years before you.''

_I had entered on my studies at Oxford, while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home!''_<br/>To this end he had given up his house in Weymouth Street, and had taken this opportunity of moving himself, his scientific instruments, and his two charming daughters-LRB- he had been a widower for some years-RRB- into the more peaceful atmosphere of Norwood.

_`` Not very good, I am afraid._<br/>`` My nerves are not very strong, I am afraid.''

_But now really, do not you think Udolpho the nicest book in the world?''_<br/>I could not put one before the other, but I do none an injustice when I say that Lucia was the equal of the best.

_`` The nicest-- by which I suppose you mean the neatest._<br/>`` And which do you think the prettiest of them?''

_That must depend upon the binding.''_<br/>The spirit then depended upon matter.

_`` Henry,'' said Miss Tilney,`` you are very impertinent._<br/>` Nay, John, you are too absurd!'

_Miss Morland, he is treating you exactly as he does his sister._<br/>That is what he always says, and my aunt the same.

_He is forever finding fault with me, for some incorrectness of language, and now he is taking the same liberty with you._<br/>Or perhaps you will see that there is the ring of truth in what I say, and you will follow it up, and so make your name for ever as a man who does not grudge personal trouble where justice is to be done.

_The word` nicest,' as you used it, did not suit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way.''_<br/>The same power which saved us may save them, and let us pray together that it may be so, always remembering that if, in spite of our prayers, it should _ not _ be so, then that also must be accepted as the best and wisest thing.''

_`` I am sure,'' cried Catherine,`` I did not mean to say anything wrong; but it is a nice book, and why should not I call it so?''_<br/>`` My dear Mrs. Westmacott,'' cried Clara,`` I assure you that I have not the least idea what it is that you are talking of.''

_`` Very true,'' said Henry,`` and this is a very nice day, and we are taking a very nice walk, and you are two very nice young ladies._<br/>`` You are too young for strong waters,'' she said,`` but this talking gives one a dryness, and--''  Then it was that Boy Jim did a wonderful thing.

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_It is a very nice word indeed!_<br/>`` It was extremely good of you.''

_It does for everything._<br/>That is all.''

_Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness, propriety, delicacy, or refinement-- people were nice in their dress, in their sentiments, or their choice._<br/>The cases are manifold, and I mention only a few of them, but my point is that the whole of this system, from the lowest physical phenomenon of a table-rap up to the most inspired utterance of a prophet, is one complete whole, each attached to the next one, and that when the humbler end of that chain was placed in the hand of humanity, it was in order that they might, by diligence and reason, feel their way up it until they reached the revelation which waited in the end.

_But now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word.''_<br/>However, on this occasion we found everything in order.

_`` While, in fact,'' cried his sister,`` it ought only to be applied to you, without any commendation at all._<br/>`` Oh, no,'' cried Ida,`` Mrs. Westmacott says that there should be one law for all.

_You are more nice than wise._<br/>`` You got rather more than you gave.''

_Come, Miss Morland, let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction, while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms we like best._<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_It is a most interesting work._<br/>That is a very important point.

_You are fond of that kind of reading?''_<br/>What were you reading?''

_`` To say the truth, I do not much like any other.''_<br/>`` I do not see any other way.''

_`` Indeed!''_<br/>`` Indeed!''

_`` That is, I can read poetry and plays, and things of that sort, and do not dislike travels._<br/>` Here comes some one who is not afraid to gallop,' I remarked.

_But history, real solemn history, I can not be interested in._<br/>So I read it, but it is well not to be dogmatic on such matters.

_Can you?''_<br/>Do you?''

_`` Yes, I am fond of history.''_<br/>`` I am glad of that.''

_`` I wish I were too._<br/>`` Then I wish I was also.''

_I read it a little as a duty, but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me._<br/>I hardly know what I said to him, but the facts were so deadly that he did not attempt to deny his guilt.

_The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women at all-- it is very tiresome: and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great deal of it must be invention._<br/>And when I see these faithful men, and when I think that every broad piece in the strong boxes of my townsmen is ready to support them, and when I know that the persecuted remnant throughout the country is wrestling hard in prayer for us, then a voice speaks within me and tells me that we shall tear down the idols of Dagon, and build up in this England of ours such a temple of the true faith that not Popery, nor Prelacy, nor idolatry, nor any other device of the Evil One shall ever prevail against it.'

_The speeches that are put into the heroes' mouths, their thoughts and designs-- the chief of all this must be invention, and invention is what delights me in other books.''_<br/>When we read so many references to the phenomena with which we are familiar, the levitations, the tongues of fire, the rushing wind, the spiritual gifts, the working of wonders, we feel that the central fact of all, the continuity of life and the communication with the dead, was most certainly known.

_`` Historians, you think,'' said Miss Tilney,`` are not happy in their flights of fancy._<br/>`` I am not so sure of that, Miss Adams,'' said the Colonel.

_They display imagination without raising interest._<br/>No use to raise hopes and let them down again.

_I am fond of history-- and am very well contented to take the false with the true._<br/>I am fond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others.

_In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records, which may be as much depended on, I conclude, as anything that does not actually pass under one's own observation; and as for the little embellishments you speak of, they are embellishments, and I like them as such._<br/>My point is, that the physical phenomena which have been proved up to the hilt for all who care to examine the evidence, are really of no account, and that their real value consists in the fact that they support and give objective reality to an immense body of knowledge which must deeply modify our previous religious views, and must, when properly understood and digested, make religion a very real thing, no longer a matter of faith, but a matter of actual experience and fact.

_If a speech be well drawn up, I read it with pleasure, by whomsoever it may be made-- and probably with much greater, if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson, than if the genuine words of Caractacus, Agricola, or Alfred the Great.''_<br/>And if what I tell you should ever chance to differ from what you have read in the book of Mr. Coke or of Mr. Oldmixon, or of any one else who has set these matters down in print, do ye bear in mind that I am telling of what I saw with these very eyes, and that I have helped to make history, which is a higher thing than to write it.

_`` You are fond of history!_<br/>`` You are sure of this?''

_And so are Mr. Allen and my father; and I have two brothers who do not dislike it._<br/>So this is the upbringing that you have had, Jim-- to think evil of that which you do not understand!

_So many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable!_<br/>And I-- ah, my friends, I was magnificent!

_At this rate, I shall not pity the writers of history any longer._<br/>If I did not make the course of events clear to you, you would hardly understand the influences which had such an effect upon my whole history.

_If people like to read their books, it is all very well, but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes, which, as I used to think, nobody would willingly ever look into, to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls, always struck me as a hard fate; and though I know it is all very right and necessary, I have often wondered at the person's courage that could sit down on purpose to do it.''_<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_`` That little boys and girls should be tormented,'' said Henry,`` is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians, I must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim, and that by their method and style, they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life._<br/>`` I have already explained to our young friend here,'' said Challenger-LRB- he has a way of alluding to me as if I were a school child ten years old-RRB-,`` that it is quite impossible that there should be an easy way up anywhere, for the simple reason that if there were the summit would not be isolated, and those conditions would not obtain which have effected so singular an interference with the general laws of survival.

_I use the verb` to torment,' as I observed to be your own method, instead of` to instruct,' supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous.''_<br/>But when I return I shall hope to find that you have reconsidered your conduct, and that you have shaken yourself clear of the pernicious influences which have recently made such an alteration in your conduct.''

_`` You think me foolish to call instruction a torment, but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell, if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together, and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it, as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home, you would allow that` to torment' and` to instruct' might sometimes be used as synonymous words.''_<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_`` Very probably._<br/>`` Very clearly.''

_But historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read; and even you yourself, who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe, very intense application, may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth-while to be tormented for two or three years of one's life, for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it._<br/>It is difficult to think that some fifteen or twenty messages from various sources of which I have personal notes, all agree, and yet are all wrong, nor is it easy to suppose that spirits can tell the truth about our world but untruth about their own.

_Consider-- if reading had not been taught, Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain-- or perhaps might not have written at all.''_<br/>If it had not been for that villain Mansoor, you need not have appeared at all.''

_Catherine assented-- and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady's merits closed the subject._<br/>`` You are a sea-officer of my own heart, Stone,'' said he, when her ladyship had exhausted her panegyric.

_The Tilneys were soon engaged in another on which she had nothing to say._<br/>She and I never took to each other very much; but now I hope all that may be ended, and when I marry she will come and stay with me.''

_They were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to drawing, and decided on its capability of being formed into pictures, with all the eagerness of real taste._<br/>It is everywhere apparent that their spirits, even the spirits of those who, like Myers and Hodgson, were in specially close touch with psychic subjects, and knew all that could be done, were in difficulties when they desired to get cognisance of a material thing, such as a written document.

_Here Catherine was quite lost._<br/>I was lost.

_She knew nothing of drawing-- nothing of taste: and she listened to them with an attention which brought her little profit, for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to her._<br/>There was nothing that I could see to distinguish him from any professional driver, save that he was chatting very freely with a dainty little woman who was perched on the box beside him.

_The little which she could understand, however, appeared to contradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter before._<br/>When he spoke of seeing her again so soon, he was referring to her own approaching death, which he had been assured could not be delayed more than a very few months.

_It seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the top of an high hill, and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof of a fine day._<br/>Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound.

_She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance._<br/>`` You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

_A misplaced shame._<br/>A shame and a disgrace.

_Where people wish to attach, they should always be ignorant._<br/>Why should you wish to injure us?

_To come with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others, which a sensible person would always wish to avoid._<br/>I would have you to understand that it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, and I refuse to entertain the most remote sense of personal obligation.

_A woman especially, if she have the misfortune of knowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can._<br/>If the ladies will come after me, they will be spared the sight of anything painful.''

_The advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already set forth by the capital pen of a sister author; and to her treatment of the subject I will only add, in justice to men, that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex, imbecility in females is a great enhancement of their personal charms, there is a portion of them too reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anything more in woman than ignorance._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_But Catherine did not know her own advantages-- did not know that a good-looking girl, with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant mind, can not fail of attracting a clever young man, unless circumstances are particularly untoward._<br/>The lady came, not altogether with the approval of her husband, and though she never gave indications of any very great psychic force, we were able, at least, to obtain those usual phenomena of message-tilting which are at the same time so puerile and so inexplicable.

_In the present instance, she confessed and lamented her want of knowledge, declared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw; and a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed, in which his instructions were so clear that she soon began to see beauty in everything admired by him, and her attention was so earnest that he became perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_He talked of foregrounds, distances, and second distances-- side-screens and perspectives-- lights and shades; and Catherine was so hopeful a scholar that when they gained the top of Beechen Cliff, she voluntarily rejected the whole city of Bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape._<br/>I look back at the chain of incidents, my interview with McArdle, Challenger's first note of alarm in the Times, the absurd journey in the train, the pleasant luncheon, the catastrophe, and now it has come to this-- that we linger alone upon an empty planet, and so sure is our fate that I can regard these lines, written from mechanical professional habit and never to be seen by human eyes, as the words of one who is already dead, so closely does he stand to the shadowed borderland over which all outside this one little circle of friends have already gone.

_Delighted with her progress, and fearful of wearying her with too much wisdom at once, Henry suffered the subject to decline, and by an easy transition from a piece of rocky fragment and the withered oak which he had placed near its summit, to oaks in general, to forests, the enclosure of them, waste lands, crown lands and government, he shortly found himself arrived at politics; and from politics, it was an easy step to silence._<br/>When I looked back upon my series of adventures, my wanderings in the salt-marsh, my entrance into the cottage, my discovery of the papers, my capture by the conspirators, the long period of suspense with Toussac's dreadful thumb upon my chin, and finally the moving scenes which I had witnessed-- the killing of the hound, the capture of Lesage, and the arrival of the soldiers-- I could not wonder that my nerves were overwrought, and that I surprised myself in little convulsive gestures, like those of a frightened child.

_The general pause which succeeded his short disquisition on the state of the nation was put an end to by Catherine, who, in rather a solemn tone of voice, uttered these words,`` I have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London.''_<br/>For you may remember, my children, that I stated when I first took it in hand to narrate to you these passages of my life, that the hopes of Monmouth's party rested very much upon the raid which Argyle and the Scottish exiles had made upon Ayrshire, where it was hoped that they would create such a disturbance as would divert a good share of King James's forces, and so make our march to London less difficult.

_Miss Tilney, to whom this was chiefly addressed, was startled, and hastily replied,`` Indeed!_<br/>` Nay, sir, it is too much honour,' cried Dame Hobson, with a simper.'

_And of what nature?''_<br/>And what of yourself?

_`` That I do not know, nor who is the author._<br/>`` I do not know.''

_I have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet.''_<br/>If anything, they were more impossible than at the first point where we had met them.

_`` Good heaven!_<br/>`` Good heaven!''

_Where could you hear of such a thing?''_<br/>How could you possibly know?

_`` A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from London yesterday._<br/>`` What was the last news when you left London?''

_It is to be uncommonly dreadful._<br/>It is inconceivable and horrible.

_I shall expect murder and everything of the kind.''_<br/>`` They'll have you for murder as sure as fate.''

_`` You speak with astonishing composure!_<br/>` You speak warmly, sir.

_But I hope your friend's accounts have been exaggerated; and if such a design is known beforehand, proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect.''_<br/>But when I return I shall hope to find that you have reconsidered your conduct, and that you have shaken yourself clear of the pernicious influences which have recently made such an alteration in your conduct.''

_`` Government,'' said Henry, endeavouring not to smile,`` neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters._<br/>` That need not hinder us,' said he, with a sour smile;' I will undertake that he never claims the promise.'

_There must be murder; and government cares not how much.''_<br/>There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder.

_The ladies stared._<br/> Clara stared.

_He laughed, and added,`` Come, shall I make you understand each other, or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can?_<br/>`` If you will let me know how your investigations go,'' he continued,`` I shall be happy to give you any help I can.

_No-- I will be noble._<br/>No; why should I?''

_I will prove myself a man, no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head._<br/>`` You will ask my pardon for that speech, sir, for it is from no less a person than Sir Charles Tregellis, my own brother.''

_I have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours._<br/>I had no pretence to greater physical courage than my neighbours, but familiarity with a subject robs it of those vague and undefined terrors which are the most appalling to the imaginative mind.

_Perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute-- neither vigorous nor keen._<br/>`` Women are never to be entirely trusted,-- not the best of them.''

_Perhaps they may want observation, discernment, judgment, fire, genius, and wit.''_<br/>` Yet perhaps it may be from want of habit as much as from want of courage.'

_`` Miss Morland, do not mind what he says; but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot.''_<br/>`` Colonel Gerard,'' said he,`` I can not promise you your life, for it is not our custom, but I can give you an easy death or I can give you a terrible one.

_`` Riot!_<br/>`` Capital!''

_What riot?''_<br/>What?

_`` My dear Eleanor, the riot is only in your own brain._<br/> And I, dear friends-- imagine the fever, the ferment, the madness of my mind!

_The confusion there is scandalous._<br/>`` It is indeed deplorable.

_Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out, in three duodecimo volumes, two hundred and seventy-six pages in each, with a frontispiece to the first, of two tombstones and a lantern-- do you understand?_<br/>How spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by Miss Julia Ames, who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication, but admitted, after fifteen years, that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over.

_And you, Miss Morland-- my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions._<br/>All came right in the end, but I never heard the true story of the unfortunate beauty and her three crippled sisters.''

_You talked of expected horrors in London-- and instead of instantly conceiving, as any rational creature would have done, that such words could relate only to a circulating library, she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George's Fields, the Bank attacked, the Tower threatened, the streets of London flowing with blood, a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons-LRB- the hopes of the nation-RRB- called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents, and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney, in the moment of charging at the head of his troop, knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window._<br/>_-RSB-  THE END    THE GREAT KEINPLATZ EXPERIMENT  And Other Tales of Twilight and the Unseen  by  A.

_Forgive her stupidity._<br/>Beware of her!

_The fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman; but she is by no means a simpleton in general.''_<br/>` Now, sir,' she continued,' I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative.

_Catherine looked grave._<br/> Holmes looked grave.

_`` And now, Henry,'' said Miss Tilney,`` that you have made us understand each other, you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself-- unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister, and a great brute in your opinion of women in general._<br/>Indeed, this might be said of many women in the England of those days, for the men were rude and rough and coarse, with boorish habits and few accomplishments, while the women were the most lovely and tender that I have ever known.

_Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways.''_<br/>Lady Jane did not want him.

_`` I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them.''_<br/>`` Yes-- if you could take her off with you I should be still more grateful.''

_`` No doubt; but that is no explanation of the present.''_<br/>`` No, no; it is out of the question.''

_`` What am I to do?''_<br/>`` What am I to do?

_`` You know what you ought to do._<br/>`` But what do you mean to do?''

_Clear your character handsomely before her._<br/>`` All that you say is perfectly true.

_Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women.''_<br/>Whatever would the women think of him!

_`` Miss Morland, I think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world-- especially of those-- whoever they may be-- with whom I happen to be in company.''_<br/>`` Well, Miss Sadie, I hope with all my heart that you will be able to say the same when you are the same age as your Aunt.

_`` That is not enough._<br/>`` It is not yet time.''

_Be more serious.''_<br/>What more?

_`` Miss Morland, no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than I do._<br/>`` Miss Eva Cameron be her name, sir,'' she said:`` but who she be, or where she came fra, I know little more than yoursel'.

_In my opinion, nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half.''_<br/>Personally, I can truly say that I never felt stronger in body or better balanced in mind in my life.''

_`` We shall get nothing more serious from him now, Miss Morland._<br/>`` We can do nothing more,'' said Mrs. Challenger.

_He is not in a sober mood._<br/>I am not in a mood to argue such a point.''

_But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood, if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all, or an unkind one of me.''_<br/>If from all this you learn anything which shows you her real character, or which seems to you to corroborate the story which I have told you, then I am sure that I can rely upon your goodness of heart to come to the rescue of an innocent man.

_It was no effort to Catherine to believe that Henry Tilney could never be wrong._<br/>`` And as far as I can help,'' said Harvey Deacon,`` it will certainly never be done again.''

_His manner might sometimes surprise, but his meaning must always be just: and what she did not understand, she was almost as ready to admire, as what she did._<br/>`` I am as glad to see you as ever I was to see a man in my life, but I confess that I did not expect you.''

_The whole walk was delightful, and though it ended too soon, its conclusion was delightful too; her friends attended her into the house, and Miss Tilney, before they parted, addressing herself with respectful form, as much to Mrs. Allen as to Catherine, petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day after the next._<br/> It was just three days after the Doctor and the Admiral had congratulated each other upon the closer tie which was to unite their two families, and to turn their friendship into something even dearer and more intimate, that Miss Ida Walker received a letter which caused her some surprise and considerable amusement.

_No difficulty was made on Mrs. Allen's side, and the only difficulty on Catherine's was in concealing the excess of her pleasure._<br/>No one could entertain more charmingly than she, for she moved about among the people with her amiable smile, setting everybody at their ease by her kindly natural manner, and by the conviction which she gave them that she was thoroughly at her ease herself.

_The morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all her friendship and natural affection, for no thought of Isabella or James had crossed her during their walk._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_When the Tilneys were gone, she became amiable again, but she was amiable for some time to little effect; Mrs. Allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her anxiety; she had heard nothing of any of them._<br/>I had expected to find my Cousin Sibylle there, but to my surprise there was no sign of her, nor had she left any word to tell us whither she had gone.

_Towards the end of the morning, however, Catherine, having occasion for some indispensable yard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment's delay, walked out into the town, and in Bond Street overtook the second Miss Thorpe as she was loitering towards Edgar's Buildings between two of the sweetest girls in the world, who had been her dear friends all the morning._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_From her, she soon learned that the party to Clifton had taken place._<br/>She spoke just now as if she had mentioned the plan which I had conceived to you.

_`` They set off at eight this morning,'' said Miss Anne,`` and I am sure I do not envy them their drive._<br/>How spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by Miss Julia Ames, who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication, but admitted, after fifteen years, that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over.

_I think you and I are very well off to be out of the scrape._<br/>So I sized you down, and I'm bound to say that you came well out of it.

_It must be the dullest thing in the world, for there is not a soul at Clifton at this time of year._<br/>Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side,-- which is not to be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it.

_Belle went with your brother, and John drove Maria.''_<br/>I was speaking of your brother, Jem.''

_Catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing this part of the arrangement._<br/> She looked so beautiful in her enthusiasm that I nearly brought down the whole level of the interview.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_yes,'' rejoined the other,`` Maria is gone._<br/>She was gone.

_She was quite wild to go._<br/>He was quite sharp enough to see that.

_She thought it would be something very fine._<br/>I think it would be very nice.''

_I can not say I admire her taste; and for my part, I was determined from the first not to go, if they pressed me ever so much.''_<br/>It was not the first time, my friends, as you are well aware, and you know the reasons that I had to trust that neither nerve nor judgment would ever fail me.

_Catherine, a little doubtful of this, could not help answering,`` I wish you could have gone too._<br/>`` I think, after your kind attention to me, I can not do less than relieve any curiosity that you may feel.

_It is a pity you could not all go.''_<br/>Do you not think that it is a great pity?'

_`` Thank you; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me._<br/>` Nay, it is surely plain enough to you now.

_Indeed, I would not have gone on any account._<br/>`` I would not have missed the investigation for anything.

_I was saying so to Emily and Sophia when you overtook us.''_<br/>`` I am so sorry to trouble you, dear Ida,'' she said.

_Catherine was still unconvinced; but glad that Anne should have the friendship of an Emily and a Sophia to console her, she bade her adieu without much uneasiness, and returned home, pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it, and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either James or Isabella to resent her resistance any longer._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_CHAPTER 15  Early the next day, a note from Isabella, speaking peace and tenderness in every line, and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance, hastened Catherine, in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity, to Edgar's Buildings._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_The two youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour; and, on Anne's quitting it to call her sister, Catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday's party._<br/>The growing friendship of the three families, the engagement of Harold Denver with Clara Walker, the engagement of Charles Westmacott with her sister, the dangerous fascination which the widow exercised over the Doctor, the preposterous behavior of the Walker girls and the unhappiness which they had caused their father, not one of these incidents escaped the notice of the two maiden ladies.

_Maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it; and Catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world, that nobody could imagine how charming it had been, and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive._<br/>No one could entertain more charmingly than she, for she moved about among the people with her amiable smile, setting everybody at their ease by her kindly natural manner, and by the conviction which she gave them that she was thoroughly at her ease herself.

_Such was the information of the first five minutes; the second unfolded thus much in detail-- that they had driven directly to the York Hotel, ate some soup, and bespoke an early dinner, walked down to the pump-room, tasted the water, and laid out some shillings in purses and spars; thence adjoined to eat ice at a pastry-cook's, and hurrying back to the hotel, swallowed their dinner in haste, to prevent being in the dark; and then had a delightful drive back, only the moon was not up, and it rained a little, and Mr. Morland's horse was so tired he could hardly get it along._<br/>For the wealthy dignitaries of the Church, rolling in their carriages to their cathedrals, in order to preach the doctrines of their Master, who wore His sandals out in tramping over the countryside, he professed the most bitter contempt; nor was he more lenient to those poorer members of the clergy who winked at the vices of their patrons that they might secure a seat at their table, and who would sit through a long evening of profanity rather than bid good-bye to the cheesecakes and the wine flask.

_Catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction._<br/> The Professor purred with satisfaction.

_It appeared that Blaize Castle had never been thought of; and, as for all the rest, there was nothing to regret for half an instant._<br/>From that time I have never heard him allude to the matter, nor did he ever give us any reason why he should so confidently have expected the second coming upon that particular night.

_Maria's intelligence concluded with a tender effusion of pity for her sister Anne, whom she represented as insupportably cross, from being excluded the party._<br/>The growing friendship of the three families, the engagement of Harold Denver with Clara Walker, the engagement of Charles Westmacott with her sister, the dangerous fascination which the widow exercised over the Doctor, the preposterous behavior of the Walker girls and the unhappiness which they had caused their father, not one of these incidents escaped the notice of the two maiden ladies.

_`` She will never forgive me, I am sure; but, you know, how could I help it?_<br/> I knew that it was not so, but how could I bring myself to tell her?

_John would have me go, for he vowed he would not drive her, because she had such thick ankles._<br/>I would have taken you into my confidence, Charles, had it not been that your suspicions had wounded me deeply-- for I did not at that time understand how strong the reasons were which had prejudiced you against me.

_I dare say she will not be in good humour again this month; but I am determined I will not be cross; it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper.''_<br/>I can not expect the story to be believed, but it is so singular that I should feel that it was a breach of duty if I did not put it upon record-- so here it is, and your belief or incredulity is your own affair.

_Isabella now entered the room with so eager a step, and a look of such happy importance, as engaged all her friend's notice._<br/>' I shall have your robes ready, and also the rooms of our guests,' she answered, and so, with a bright smile to us, tripped away upon her duty.

_Maria was without ceremony sent away, and Isabella, embracing Catherine, thus began:`` Yes, my dear Catherine, it is so indeed; your penetration has not deceived you._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_That arch eye of yours!_<br/>` What an eye!

_It sees through everything.''_<br/>It is all right.''

_Catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance._<br/>' I swear that you are mistaken,' I replied.'

_`` Nay, my beloved, sweetest friend,'' continued the other,`` compose yourself._<br/>`` Nay, dear, you must go, for it may be the one great chance of your life.

_I am amazingly agitated, as you perceive._<br/>I am most anxious to be of use to you.

_Let us sit down and talk in comfort._<br/>Do sit down and talk it over.

_Well, and so you guessed it the moment you had my note?_<br/>But what's this you've brought, Tregellis, eh?''

_Sly creature!_<br/>you villain!

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_My dear Catherine, you alone, who know my heart, can judge of my present happiness._<br/>Oh, Clara, I do hope your heart wo n't fail you.''

_Your brother is the most charming of men._<br/>` The best of fathers!

_I only wish I were more worthy of him._<br/>I do wish you would n't; for things are so much nicer as they are.''

_But what will your excellent father and mother say?_<br/>What would your father say?

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_Heavens!_<br/>Heavens!

_When I think of them I am so agitated!''_<br/>But it is for you that I am frightened, dear.

_Catherine's understanding began to awake: an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind; and, with the natural blush of so new an emotion, she cried out,`` Good heaven!_<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_My dear Isabella, what do you mean?_<br/>Oh, dear, dear, what is this I hear?''

_Can you-- can you really be in love with James?''_<br/>`` Well, I love that you should think me so.

_This bold surmise, however, she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact._<br/> But suddenly I had understood it all.

_The anxious affection, which she was accused of having continually watched in Isabella's every look and action, had, in the course of their yesterday's party, received the delightful confession of an equal love._<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James._<br/>Now her spirit seemed very near him, and his own was tempered by its presence.

_Never had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest, wonder, and joy._<br/>Never was as pleased at anything in my life!

_Her brother and her friend engaged!_<br/>`` See, my friends!

_New to such circumstances, the importance of it appeared unspeakably great, and she contemplated it as one of those grand events, of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return._<br/>All of this is surely tidings of great joy, and I repeat that it is not a vague faith or hope, but that it is supported by all the laws of evidence which agree that where many independent witnesses give a similar account, that account has a claim to be considered a true one.

_The strength of her feelings she could not express; the nature of them, however, contented her friend._<br/>The girl, not a little transported at her good success, came and assured her friends that she would now be well.

_The happiness of having such a sister was their first effusion, and the fair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Delighting, however, as Catherine sincerely did in the prospect of the connection, it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations._<br/>`` Charles would be flattered if he could see the gracious way in which we receive his kindness,'' said she.

_`` You will be so infinitely dearer to me, my Catherine, than either Anne or Maria: I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland's family than to my own.''_<br/>As to his brightness, it really does not matter, for his aunt, Mrs. Westmacott, is very rich, much richer than you would think from her style of living, and she has made him a handsome provision.''

_This was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine._<br/>`` Certainly,'' said I; and that was the foundation of my friendship with Thomas Crabbe.

_`` You are so like your dear brother,'' continued Isabella,`` that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you._<br/>`` My brother and I,'' said he,`` were, as you may imagine, much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of.

_But so it always is with me; the first moment settles everything._<br/>But you will know all about it soon enough.

_The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas-- the very first moment I beheld him-- my heart was irrecoverably gone._<br/>And yet my chance was a terribly long time coming, for many months had passed before the visit to Cliffe Royal gave me the opportunity which I longed for by day and dreamed of by night.

_I remember I wore my yellow gown, with my hair done up in braids; and when I came into the drawing-room, and John introduced him, I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before.''_<br/>I had seen his flaring yellow barouche flying through Friar's Oak many a time, and had halloaed and waved my hat with the others as it passed, but never in my wildest dreams had it entered my head that I should ever be called upon to look him in the face and answer his questions.

_Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love; for, though exceedingly fond of her brother, and partial to all his endowments, she had never in her life thought him handsome._<br/>` Well,' said she,` there are some who call him a usurper, and wish him all evil; but for my own part I have never heard of anything that he has said and done which was not great and noble.

_`` I remember too, Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening, and wore her puce-coloured sarsenet; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her; I could not sleep a wink all right for thinking of it._<br/> But in spite of gleams of sunshine, there was thunder in the air, and Champion Harrison had just whispered in my ear that he was quite sure that we should never get through the night without trouble, and was advising me, if it got very bad, to take refuge under the table, when the landlord entered the room hurriedly and handed a note to my uncle.

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_Catherine, the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother's account!_<br/>I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends.''

_I would not have you suffer half what I have done!_<br/>I could not bear to avow that which I had done.

_I am grown wretchedly thin, I know; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety; you have seen enough of it._<br/>I think,' I went on, as he followed me into the passage,` that you will not say that your captivity hath been made very harsh for you.

_I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually-- so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church!_<br/>For my own part I fear that I betrayed myself, for the eye becomes more eloquent when the tongue is silent.

_But my secret I was always sure would be safe with you.''_<br/>I think it is safe to say that things can never be quite the same again.

_Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer; but ashamed of an ignorance little expected, she dared no longer contest the point, nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her._<br/> The Emperors set face and firm manner showed it was hopeless, and yet my cousin persevered as no one but a woman who pleads for her lover would have dared to do.

_Her brother, she found, was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton, to make known his situation and ask consent; and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of Isabella._<br/>For my own part I was relieved at the explanation, for my father had left London in the full conviction that a vacancy would speedily be found for us both, and the one thing which had weighed upon my mind was that I might have found it hard to leave my uncle without interfering with the plans which he had formed.

_Catherine endeavoured to persuade her, as she was herself persuaded, that her father and mother would never oppose their son's wishes._<br/>I had feared that the boy might receive evil from her, and had never dreamed in my blindness that she might get good from him.

_`` It is impossible,'' said she,`` for parents to be more kind, or more desirous of their children's happiness; I have no doubt of their consenting immediately.''_<br/>` Now, sir,' she continued,' I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative.

_`` Morland says exactly the same,'' replied Isabella;`` and yet I dare not expect it; my fortune will be so small; they never can consent to it._<br/>`` We ca n't all be Stanleys and Burtons,'' said I;`` besides, we do n't get the chance,-- at least, I never had the chance.

_Your brother, who might marry anybody!''_<br/>`` I dare say your father would act for me, nephew?

_Here Catherine again discerned the force of love._<br/>`` You believe in love, then?''

_`` Indeed, Isabella, you are too humble._<br/>`` Yes, dear, you are right.

_The difference of fortune can be nothing to signify.''_<br/>Nothing can be said to be certain upon this point.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_My sweet Catherine, in your generous heart I know it would signify nothing; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many._<br/>All of this is surely tidings of great joy, and I repeat that it is not a vague faith or hope, but that it is supported by all the laws of evidence which agree that where many independent witnesses give a similar account, that account has a claim to be considered a true one.

_As for myself, I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed._<br/>Now I wish to _ prove _ it to you, and to show you that which is only a thought.

_Had I the command of millions, were I mistress of the whole world, your brother would be my only choice.''_<br/>I saw that I was suspected, and I saw, also, that even if I were to clear myself, it could only be done by a public confession of the infamy of my brother.

_This charming sentiment, recommended as much by sense as novelty, gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_`` I am sure they will consent,'' was her frequent declaration;`` I am sure they will be delighted with you.''_<br/>`` I am sure,'' said she,`` that dear mother would like papa to do whatever would make him most happy.

_`` For my own part,'' said Isabella,`` my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me._<br/>`` Your common sense will, I am sure, sustain my objection and realize that it was better that I should direct my own movements and appear only at the exact moment when my presence was needed.

_Where people are really attached, poverty itself is wealth; grandeur I detest: I would not settle in London for the universe._<br/>Between ourselves, I have very good reason to wish him to stay with me, and I am sure that, with his high spirit and his ideas, he would never settle down again after once he had a taste o' London.

_A cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy._<br/>It was a two-roomed cottage, which had once belonged to some shepherd, but had long been deserted, and was crumbling rapidly to ruin.

_There are some charming little villas about Richmond.''_<br/>There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn well.

_`` Richmond!''_<br/>`` Harrison!''

_cried Catherine._<br/>Mary cried.

_`` You must settle near Fullerton._<br/>`` You can wait, Austin.

_You must be near us.''_<br/>You must come and see us.

_`` I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not._<br/>`` I am sure that he would not.''

_If I can but be near you, I shall be satisfied._<br/>If you can but suggest how I can compensate you, you will find me ready and willing.''

_But this is idle talking!_<br/>But it was no time now for talk.

_I will not allow myself to think of such things, till we have your father's answer._<br/>I can understand that your father might not like to lose you.

_Morland says that by sending it tonight to Salisbury, we may have it tomorrow._<br/>I must be in London by morning, for we hope that Danvers and Wildman may be able to raise the city.

_Tomorrow?_<br/>Well?''

_I know I shall never have courage to open the letter._<br/>I doubt we shall never make a soldier of you,' he remarked.

_I know it will be the death of me.''_<br/>`` It's life and death, you know.

_A reverie succeeded this conviction-- and when Isabella spoke again, it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding-gown._<br/> When the good Professor finally fulfilled his promise, and published an account of what occurred, the narrative was so extraordinary that it was received with general incredulity.

_Their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself, who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for Wiltshire._<br/>  CHAPTER XIII-- LORD NELSON   My father's appointment with Lord Nelson was an early one, and he was the more anxious to be punctual as he knew how much the Admiral's movements must be affected by the news which we had heard the night before.

_Catherine wished to congratulate him, but knew not what to say, and her eloquence was only in her eyes._<br/>And yet she did not like this secrecy, this disinclination upon the part of one so frank and honest as Ida to tell her what was passing.

_From them, however, the eight parts of speech shone out most expressively, and James could combine them with ease._<br/>The event itself will always be marvellous, but the circumstances that we four were together at the time of this extraordinary episode came about in a most natural and, indeed, inevitable fashion.

_Impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home, his adieus were not long; and they would have been yet shorter, had he not been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that he would go._<br/>They were never at their ease, always upon the brink of a catastrophe, encouraged one day only to be rudely rebuffed the next, bullied in public and slighted in private, and yet, in spite of it all, the singular fact remains that they loved him and served him as no monarch has been loved and served.

_Twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone._<br/>He ran towards me in his eagerness when he saw me come out from the door.

_`` Indeed, Morland, I must drive you away._<br/>I myself will drive you all to London.''

_Consider how far you have to ride._<br/>Could you help me so far?''

_I can not bear to see you linger so._<br/>I can not ask you to share it.''

_For heaven's sake, waste no more time._<br/>But we must waste no time.

_There, go, go-- I insist on it.''_<br/>But one thing I now insist upon.

_The two friends, with hearts now more united than ever, were inseparable for the day; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along._<br/> It was just three days after the Doctor and the Admiral had congratulated each other upon the closer tie which was to unite their two families, and to turn their friendship into something even dearer and more intimate, that Miss Ida Walker received a letter which caused her some surprise and considerable amusement.

_Mrs. Thorpe and her son, who were acquainted with everything, and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland's consent, to consider Isabella's engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family, were allowed to join their counsels, and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters._<br/>The growing friendship of the three families, the engagement of Harold Denver with Clara Walker, the engagement of Charles Westmacott with her sister, the dangerous fascination which the widow exercised over the Doctor, the preposterous behavior of the Walker girls and the unhappiness which they had caused their father, not one of these incidents escaped the notice of the two maiden ladies.

_To Catherine's simple feelings, this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant, nor consistently supported; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out, had its inconsistency been less their friend; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their`` I know what''; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit, a display of family ingenuity, on one side in the mystery of an affected secret, on the other of undefined discovery, all equally acute._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Catherine was with her friend again the next day, endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters; a needful exertion, for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near, Isabella became more and more desponding, and before the letter arrived, had worked herself into a state of real distress._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_But when it did come, where could distress be found?_<br/>But if it were not, then what could it be?

_`` I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents, and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness,'' were the first three lines, and in one moment all was joyful security._<br/>I have no doubt that you feel the same way yourself, and that you would not care to stake the whole credit of the Gazette upon this adventure until we can meet the chorus of criticism and scepticism which such articles must of necessity elicit.

_The brightest glow was instantly spread over Isabella's features, all care and anxiety seemed removed, her spirits became almost too high for control, and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals._<br/>That colour alone showed that she could be none other than the Empress; but the dignity of her carriage, the fierce authority of her magnificent dark eyes, and the perfect beauty of her haughty face, all proclaimed that it could only be that of Theodora who, in spite of her lowly origin, was the most majestic as well as the most maturely lovely of all the women in her kingdom.

_Mrs. Thorpe, with tears of joy, embraced her daughter, her son, her visitor, and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with satisfaction._<br/>`` Come, come, my dear lady,'' said he,`` you speak vastly beyond my merits;'' upon which encouragement she started again in a theatrical apostrophe to Britain's darling and Neptune's eldest son, which he endured with the same signs of gratitude and pleasure.

_Her heart was overflowing with tenderness._<br/>Her heart was terribly diseased.

_It was`` dear John'' and`` dear Catherine'' at every word;`` dear Anne and dear Maria'' must immediately be made sharers in their felicity; and two`` dears'' at once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned._<br/>And yet, when I knew that the fact was attested by three eye-witnesses, who were Lord Dunraven, Lord Lindsay, and Captain Wynne, all men of honour and repute, who were willing afterwards to take their oath upon it, I could not but admit that the evidence for this was more direct than for any of those far-off events which the whole world has agreed to accept as true.

_John himself was no skulker in joy._<br/>There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face.

_He not only bestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the finest fellows in the world, but swore off many sentences in his praise._<br/>But I had not got half through my story, and Jim, like the good fellow that he was, had just begun to forget his own troubles in his delight at my good fortune, when my uncle called to me from without.

_The letter, whence sprang all this felicity, was short, containing little more than this assurance of success; and every particular was deferred till James could write again._<br/> I can not end this little book better than by using words more eloquent than any which I could write, a splendid sample of English style as well as of English thought.

_But for particulars Isabella could well afford to wait._<br/>But perhaps you would care to wait.

_The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland's promise; his honour was pledged to make everything easy; and by what means their income was to be formed, whether landed property were to be resigned, or funded money made over, was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern._<br/>Sextus might have done well, for he became clerk to Johnny Tranter the attorney; but he was of an enterprising turn, and he shifted the whole business, papers, cash, and all to the Lowlands, to the no small inconvenience of his employer, who hath never been able to lay hands either on one or the other from that day to this.

_She knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment, and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities._<br/>Did she love the heroic and the spectacular for its own noble sake, or was it for the glory which might, without effort or sacrifice, be reflected upon herself?

_She saw herself at the end of a few weeks, the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at Fullerton, the envy of every valued old friend in Putney, with a carriage at her command, a new name on her tickets, and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger._<br/>Often as I rode behind my caravan, and gazed at the grotesque figures which bore my wares in front of me, I found it hard to believe that it was indeed reality, and that it was I, I, Manuel Ducas, who lived near the Theodosian Gate of Constantinople, and shouted for the Green at the hippodrome every Sunday afternoon, who was there in so strange a land and with such singular comrades.

_When the contents of the letter were ascertained, John Thorpe, who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to London, prepared to set off._<br/>`` I would suggest to your Excellency,'' said I,`` that I have only finished the work that was planned and carried out by Monsieur Hubert, who gave his life for the cause.''

_`` Well, Miss Morland,'' said he, on finding her alone in the parlour,`` I am come to bid you good-bye.''_<br/>That was the style of the letter, and it ended by imploring me to leave the window-latch open, and to be in the front room at three in the morning, when he would come to receive my last kiss and to bid me farewell.

_Catherine wished him a good journey._<br/>I wish it to be a great success.

_Without appearing to hear her, he walked to the window, fidgeted about, hummed a tune, and seemed wholly self-occupied._<br/>My fellow-lodger had kept her room; and, steeled as my mind was against her influence, I was yet conscious of a little throb of disappointment that she should allow me to depart without a word of farewell.

_`` Shall not you be late at Devizes?''_<br/>` Shall we not make for it at once?'

_said Catherine._<br/>said Mary.

_He made no answer; but after a minute's silence burst out with,`` A famous good thing this marrying scheme, upon my soul!_<br/>It is no pleasant matter for me to dwell upon, yet, convinced as I am that there is no such thing as chance either in the great or the little things of this world, I am very sure that the sacrifices of these brave men were not thrown away, and that their strivings were not as profitless as might at first sight appear.

_A clever fancy of Morland's and Belle's._<br/>She is a clever woman, this Madame Grand.

_What do you think of it, Miss Morland?_<br/>`` What do you think of it, Watson?''

_I say it is no bad notion.''_<br/>It is no good whatever.''

_`` I am sure I think it a very good one.''_<br/>`` I am sure of it.

_`` Do you?_<br/>`` Do you mind?

_That's honest, by heavens!_<br/>`` Good heavens!''

_I am glad you are no enemy to matrimony, however._<br/>I am quite sure that no one will interfere with you there.''

_Did you ever hear the old song` Going to One Wedding Brings on Another?'_<br/>Did I ever tell you that case where Nature divorced a most loving couple?

_I say, you will come to Belle's wedding, I hope.''_<br/>`` Yes, indeed; and I hope you will come to my wedding, all of you.

_`` Yes; I have promised your sister to be with her, if possible.''_<br/>`` I am sure I wish we had,'' answered her sister.

_`` And then you know''-- twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh--`` I say, then you know, we may try the truth of this same old song.''_<br/> Was Mr. Stuart in his right mind again, or was it some coincidence of his delirium, that he should have chosen this for his song?

_`` May we?_<br/>`` May I come in?''

_But I never sing._<br/>I never heard.

_Well, I wish you a good journey._<br/>I wish it to be a great success.

_I dine with Miss Tilney today, and must now be going home.''_<br/>Go home and say that I am coming, and I will be round immediately afterwards.''

_`` Nay, but there is no such confounded hurry._<br/>`` Oh, there is no great hurry.

_Who knows when we may be together again?_<br/>Who knows what new turn matters may take?''

_Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight, and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me.''_<br/>Do not be satisfied with any evidence short of the best, but having got that, you can, it seems to me, wait for that short period when we shall all be re-united.

_`` Then why do you stay away so long?''_<br/>`` So how long do you think it took you?''

_replied Catherine-- finding that he waited for an answer._<br/>He paused and listened for an answer.

_`` That is kind of you, however-- kind and good-natured._<br/>`` It is very kind of you, ma'am.

_I shall not forget it in a hurry._<br/>I am not likely to forget it.''

_But you have more good nature and all that, than anybody living, I believe._<br/>I believe that you could do it better than any one.

_A monstrous deal of good nature, and it is not only good nature, but you have so much, so much of everything; and then you have such-- upon my soul, I do not know anybody like you.''_<br/>I did not, of course, believe in an anthropomorphic God, but I believed then, as I believe now, in an intelligent Force behind all the operations of Nature-- a force so infinitely complex and great that my finite brain could get no further than its existence.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_dear, there are a great many people like me, I dare say, only a great deal better._<br/>You have had a great deal more than ever I had, but I dare say I can make shift to test it.

_Good morning to you.''_<br/>Good day to you, and thank you.''

_`` But I say, Miss Morland, I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton before it is long, if not disagreeable.''_<br/>` At least he did not refuse you,' said I.` It is as good as a promise that; should the cause be successful, you shall be so too.'

_`` Pray do._<br/>`` Pray do.''

_My father and mother will be very glad to see you.''_<br/>I should be very glad to do it through your son.''

_`` And I hope-- I hope, Miss Morland, you will not be sorry to see me.''_<br/>`` I do hope that we shall not have to keep it up long.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_dear, not at all._<br/>That is not so at all.

_There are very few people I am sorry to see._<br/>I'm awfully sorry if I seemed to doubt you.

_Company is always cheerful.''_<br/>Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful.

_`` That is just my way of thinking._<br/>`` It's just what I want.

_Give me but a little cheerful company, let me only have the company of the people I love, let me only be where I like and with whom I like, and the devil take the rest, say I. And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same._<br/>Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me.

_But I have a notion, Miss Morland, you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters.''_<br/>I am so sorry to cause you any disappointment, and I appreciate most highly the honour which you do me, but what you ask is quite impossible.''

_`` Perhaps we may; but it is more than I ever thought of._<br/>`` More than I can ever get.

_And as to most matters, to say the truth, there are not many that I know my own mind about.''_<br/>But I've something to do now which is more in my own line, and I need not trouble you any more.''

_`` By Jove, no more do I._<br/>`` I need say no more, sir.

_It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me._<br/>It did not seem to be any personal concern of mine.

_My notion of things is simple enough._<br/>All that is essential is both very simple and very sure.

_Let me only have the girl I like, say I, with a comfortable house over my head, and what care I for all the rest?_<br/>`` If we and those whom we loved all passed over simultaneously, we should think no more of it than of changing our house.''

_Fortune is nothing._<br/>It is nothing.

_I am sure of a good income of my own; and if she had not a penny, why, so much the better.''_<br/>` Well, I think I am pretty sure of you, Berthier, for although I am fond of you for reasons of my own I do not think that you would be of much value to anyone else.

_`` Very true._<br/>`` Very clearly.''

_I think like you there._<br/>I like it.

_If there is a good fortune on one side, there can be no occasion for any on the other._<br/>There seemed a great multitude on every side of me, but I could see no one.

_No matter which has it, so that there is enough._<br/>`` But no, perhaps it is as well.

_I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another._<br/>You would just hate yourself for ever after.

_And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence._<br/>If I marry, I do want to marry a famous man!''

_Good day._<br/>Good night!

_We shall be very glad to see you at Fullerton, whenever it is convenient.''_<br/>I shall be very glad to see the last of him.'

_And away she went._<br/>She was gone.

_It was not in the power of all his gallantry to detain her longer._<br/>It is not a matter on which I can well speak to her direct.

_With such news to communicate, and such a visit to prepare for, her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge; and she hurried away, leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address, and her explicit encouragement._<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_The agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother's engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion in Mr. and Mrs. Allen, by the communication of the wonderful event._<br/> She raised no objection, and for my part I was overjoyed at the proposal, as it gave me an opportunity of learning more of this singular cousin of mine, who had told me so much and yet seemed to know so much more.

_How great was her disappointment!_<br/>This is a great pity.

_The important affair, which many words of preparation ushered in, had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother's arrival; and all that they felt on the occasion was comprehended in a wish for the young people's happiness, with a remark, on the gentleman's side, in favour of Isabella's beauty, and on the lady's, of her great good luck._<br/>Young Wells, being a likely lad enough, well-spoken and high-spirited, was at once entered on the books as officer's servant, in which capacity he both gained great popularity on account of the freedom of his manners, and found an opportunity for indulging in those practical pleasantries for which he had all his life been famous.

_It was to Catherine the most surprising insensibility._<br/>And yet it was at that very instant that the most terrible danger befell me.

_The disclosure, however, of the great secret of James's going to Fullerton the day before, did raise some emotion in Mrs. Allen._<br/>When I thought of the way in which he had spoken of his unhappy friend, Lord Avon, upon the evening before, and of the emotion which he showed as he told the horrible story, I was glad to think that there was the heart of a man there, however much it might please him to conceal it.

_She could not listen to that with perfect calmness, but repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment, wished she could have known his intention, wished she could have seen him before he went, as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother, and her kind compliments to all the Skinners._<br/>Now that they had not only ceased to protect him, but had themselves become a source of trouble to him, he began to understand how great the blessing was which he had enjoyed, and to sigh for the happy days before his girls had come under the influence of his neighbor.

_CHAPTER 16  Catherine's expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable; and accordingly, though she was most politely received by General Tilney, and kindly welcomed by his daughter, though Henry was at home, and no one else of the party, she found, on her return, without spending many hours in the examination of her feelings, that she had gone to her appointment preparing for happiness which it had not afforded._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_Instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney, from the intercourse of the day, she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever, in the ease of a family party, he had never said so little, nor been so little agreeable; and, in spite of their father's great civilities to her-- in spite of his thanks, invitations, and compliments-- it had been a release to get away from him._<br/>She went on to say that the sphere she inhabited was all round the earth; that she knew about the planets; that Mars was inhabited by a race more advanced than us, and that the canals were artificial; there was no bodily pain in her sphere, but there could be mental anxiety; they were governed; they took nourishment; she had been a Catholic and was still a Catholic, but had not fared better than the Protestants; there were Buddhists and Mohammedans in her sphere, but all fared alike; she had never seen Christ and knew no more about Him than on earth, but believed in His influence; spirits prayed and they died in their new sphere before entering another; they had pleasures-- music was among them.

_It puzzled her to account for all this._<br/>How was I to account for that?

_It could not be General Tilney's fault._<br/>It would not be right nor honorable.''

_That he was perfectly agreeable and good-natured, and altogether a very charming man, did not admit of a doubt, for he was tall and handsome, and Henry's father._<br/>They were not unlike each other, either in face or figure, though the Bristol man was a few years the older, and a murmur of critical admiration was heard as the two tall, lithe figures, and keen, clean-cut faces were contrasted.

_He could not be accountable for his children's want of spirits, or for her want of enjoyment in his company._<br/>`` I was sure that you were not a man who, to clear yourself from a little money difficulty, would sacrifice the happiness of your mother and the health of your father.''

_The former she hoped at last might have been accidental, and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity._<br/>I can only regret that your peace has been disturbed by our misfortunes, and I offer you in my sister's name and my own our apologies.

_Isabella, on hearing the particulars of the visit, gave a different explanation:`` It was all pride, pride, insufferable haughtiness and pride!_<br/>Napoleon's self-confidence and his contempt of the world had the effect of making him careless as to what was thought or said of him, while Josephine, when she was carried away by jealousy, lost all the dignity and restraint which usually marked her conduct; so between them they gave some embarrassing moments to those who were about them.

_She had long suspected the family to be very high, and this made it certain._<br/>I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it.

_Such insolence of behaviour as Miss Tilney's she had never heard of in her life!_<br/>`` I never heard of such insolence in my life!''

_Not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding!_<br/>It was not for me, the guest, the captive, to make love to the sister of my host.

_To behave to her guest with such superciliousness!_<br/>How can I put such a public affront upon her?

_Hardly even to speak to her!''_<br/>Not merely like you, you understand.

_`` But it was not so bad as that, Isabella; there was no superciliousness; she was very civil.''_<br/>`` It's not so bad as we thought,'' said he,`` and yet it is bad enough.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Do n't defend her!_<br/>`` Do n't struggle!''

_And then the brother, he, who had appeared so attached to you!_<br/>Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins.

_Good heavens!_<br/>`` Good heavens!''

_Well, some people's feelings are incomprehensible._<br/>Your remarks are irrelevant and unintelligible.

_And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day?''_<br/>He never got a fair sight of it the whole time.

_`` I do not say so; but he did not seem in good spirits.''_<br/>`` It's not so bad as we thought,'' said he,`` and yet it is bad enough.

_`` How contemptible!_<br/>` Shameful!'

_Of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion._<br/>In fact, his dislike was rapidly deepening into absolute detestation.

_Let me entreat you never to think of him again, my dear Catherine; indeed he is unworthy of you.''_<br/>By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us!''

_`` Unworthy!_<br/>`` Cruel!

_I do not suppose he ever thinks of me.''_<br/>`` I did not dare to think it.''

_`` That is exactly what I say; he never thinks of you._<br/>` It is true; and yet I never expected that I should be on such terms with you.

_Such fickleness!_<br/>` Such a misfortune!

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_How different to your brother and to mine!_<br/>What do you think of my nephew Charles?''

_I really believe John has the most constant heart.''_<br/>It was your own good which I had chiefly at heart.

_`` But as for General Tilney, I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention; it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy.''_<br/>' I am glad to hear you say so,' I answered,` for it makes it easier for me to say that I wish to go my own way, and to have nothing more to do with you.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_I know no harm of him; I do not suspect him of pride._<br/>I wish you no harm, ma'am.''

_I believe he is a very gentleman-like man._<br/>`` I am a practical man.

_John thinks very well of him, and John's judgment--'' `` Well, I shall see how they behave to me this evening; we shall meet them at the rooms.''_<br/>` When the report was presented last night, and he heard of your presence in that den of thieves, he was very anxious that you should be brought to him.

_`` And must I go?''_<br/>`` Yes, I must go.

_`` Do not you intend it?_<br/>`` Why should you not?''

_I thought it was all settled.''_<br/>I thought it was they.

_`` Nay, since you make such a point of it, I can refuse you nothing._<br/>`` To you, mademoiselle, I can refuse nothing.

_But do not insist upon my being very agreeable, for my heart, you know, will be some forty miles off._<br/>That would give about forty miles, but still it is, I fear, rather far for a rescue.

_And as for dancing, do not mention it, I beg; that is quite out of the question._<br/>I do not know if it is still standing, but I should think it likely, for it was not a place much given to change.

_Charles Hodges will plague me to death, I dare say; but I shall cut him very short._<br/>Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead.''

_Ten to one but he guesses the reason, and that is exactly what I want to avoid, so I shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself.''_<br/>I think that I'll just take my chance, and stay where I am, and as I see that it's nearly five o'clock, I must ask you to excuse me.''

_Isabella's opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend; she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts._<br/> I could have explained that it was because he had betrayed his comrades, because his daughter hated him, because he had ill-used his wife, because my father regarded him as the source of all his troubles-- but the salon of the Empress was no place for a family quarrel, so I merely shrugged my shoulders, and was silent.

_The evening rewarded her confidence; she was met by one with the same kindness, and by the other with the same attention, as heretofore: Miss Tilney took pains to be near her, and Henry asked her to dance._<br/>That same night the secretary of my Lord Clarendon came to me, and announced with much form and show that, in consideration of my long devotion and the losses which I had sustained, the King was graciously pleased to make me a lottery cavalier.'

_Having heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother, Captain Tilney, was expected almost every hour, she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable-looking, handsome young man, whom she had never seen before, and who now evidently belonged to their party._<br/> Thinking, as I did, that he was speaking of our own old Queen Charlotte, I could make no meaning out of this; but my father told me afterwards that both Nelson and Lady Hamilton had conceived an extraordinary affection for the Queen of Naples, and that it was the interests of her little kingdom which he had so strenuously at heart.

_She looked at him with great admiration, and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother, though, in her eyes, his air was more assuming, and his countenance less prepossessing._<br/>Her face was pale, striking rather than pretty, but with two great dark eyes, so earnestly questioning, so quick in their transitions from joy to pathos, so swift in their comment upon every word and deed around her, that those eyes alone were to many more attractive than all the beauty of her younger sister.

_His taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior; for, within her hearing, he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself, but even laughed openly at Henry for finding it possible._<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_From the latter circumstance it may be presumed that, whatever might be our heroine's opinion of him, his admiration of her was not of a very dangerous kind; not likely to produce animosities between the brothers, nor persecutions to the lady._<br/>The lady came, not altogether with the approval of her husband, and though she never gave indications of any very great psychic force, we were able, at least, to obtain those usual phenomena of message-tilting which are at the same time so puerile and so inexplicable.

_He can not be the instigator of the three villains in horsemen's greatcoats, by whom she will hereafter be forced into a traveling-chaise and four, which will drive off with incredible speed._<br/>I will not disguise from you that the matter is serious in the last degree, and that Marshal Lannes has chosen a cavalry officer because he can be better spared than an officer of infantry or of engineers.

_Catherine, meanwhile, undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil, or of any evil at all, except that of having but a short set to dance down, enjoyed her usual happiness with Henry Tilney, listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said; and, in finding him irresistible, becoming so herself._<br/>He had certainly a strange audience to harangue: his wife perfectly acquiescent and absolutely ignorant of his meaning, Summerlee seated in the shadow, querulous and critical but interested, Lord John lounging in a corner somewhat bored by the whole proceeding, and myself beside the window watching the scene with a kind of detached attention, as if it were all a dream or something in which I had no personal interest whatever.

_At the end of the first dance, Captain Tilney came towards them again, and, much to Catherine's dissatisfaction, pulled his brother away._<br/>`` I dare say that it has happened with you, sir,'' said my uncle at last,`` that you have lost some dear messmate, in battle or wreck, and that you have put him out of your mind in the routine of your daily life, until suddenly some word or some scene brings him back to your memory, and you find your sorrow as raw as upon the first day of your loss.''

_They retired whispering together; and, though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm, and lay it down as fact, that Captain Tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her, which he now hastened to communicate to his brother, in the hope of separating them forever, she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_Her suspense was of full five minutes' duration; and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour, when they both returned, and an explanation was given, by Henry's requesting to know if she thought her friend, Miss Thorpe, would have any objection to dancing, as his brother would be most happy to be introduced to her._<br/>How spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by Miss Julia Ames, who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication, but admitted, after fifteen years, that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over.

_Catherine, without hesitation, replied that she was very sure Miss Thorpe did not mean to dance at all._<br/>'T is true that if La Jeune were dancing, or if Mrs. Bracegirdle or Mrs. Oldfield came upon the boards, we would hum and clap, but it was the fine woman that we applauded rather than the actress.'

_The cruel reply was passed on to the other, and he immediately walked away._<br/>After you was gone he walked and he walked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of his footstep.

_`` Your brother will not mind it, I know,'' said she,`` because I heard him say before that he hated dancing; but it was very good-natured in him to think of it._<br/>`` There is a good reason for that,'' said I,`` for Lord Avon was, as I have heard, your uncle's best friend; and it is but natural that he would not wish to speak of his disgrace.''

_I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down, and fancied she might wish for a partner; but he is quite mistaken, for she would not dance upon any account in the world.''_<br/>Finally, the conversation turned to music-- I am not sure that my uncle did not artfully bring it there, and the Prince, hearing from him of my tastes, would have it that I should then and there sit down at the wonderful little piano, all inlaid with mother-of-pearl, which stood in the corner, and play him the accompaniment to his song.

_Henry smiled, and said,`` How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people's actions.''_<br/>`` I promise you that you will understand this and a good deal more before we part, Sir Lothian,'' said Jim, with a curious smile playing over his face.

_`` Why?_<br/>`` Why?''

_What do you mean?''_<br/>What do you mean?''

_`` With you, it is not, How is such a one likely to be influenced, What is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person's feelings, age, situation, and probable habits of life considered-- but, How should I be influenced, What would be my inducement in acting so and so?''_<br/> He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner.

_`` I do not understand you.''_<br/>`` I do not know.''

_`` Then we are on very unequal terms, for I understand you perfectly well.''_<br/>`` Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away.

_`` Me?_<br/>`` Now?''

_Yes; I can not speak well enough to be unintelligible.''_<br/>`` Well, I can not wonder at it.

_`` Bravo!_<br/>_'' '' _ Egyptien!

_An excellent satire on modern language.''_<br/>Some little tour-de-force of the sort is in excellent taste.

_`` But pray tell me what you mean.''_<br/>` And pray what are they?'

_`` Shall I indeed?_<br/> And I?

_Do you really desire it?_<br/>`` How much did you desire?''

_But you are not aware of the consequences; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment, and certainly bring on a disagreement between us._<br/>` You are not yourself at present, but when you return to your right mind you will be ashamed of having made this public exposure of your weakness.

_`` No, no; it shall not do either; I am not afraid.''_<br/>`` I'm not much afraid of anything.''

_`` Well, then, I only meant that your attributing my brother's wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world.''_<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_Catherine blushed and disclaimed, and the gentleman's predictions were verified._<br/> Jane, on being cross-questioned, refused to commit herself beyond the statement that it depended upon the gentleman, and also upon the oysters.

_There was a something, however, in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion; and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time, forgetting to speak or to listen, and almost forgetting where she was; till, roused by the voice of Isabella, she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_Isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled, the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given; but as it was not quite enough for Catherine's comprehension, she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_`` I can not think how it could happen!_<br/>`` I can not help it.

_Isabella was so determined not to dance.''_<br/>I do not intend to marry yet.''

_`` And did Isabella never change her mind before?''_<br/>`` Tut, never think about her!

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_But, because-- And your brother!_<br/>But where is your uncle?''

_After what you told him from me, how could he think of going to ask her?''_<br/>Where could I send her, and what could I do with her?

_`` I can not take surprise to myself on that head._<br/>`` I can not help it.

_You bid me be surprised on your friend's account, and therefore I am; but as for my brother, his conduct in the business, I must own, has been no more than I believed him perfectly equal to._<br/>`` I should be loath to exercise any undue pressure upon my sister Ada; but I have given her to understand that there is no one whom I should prefer for a brother-in-law to my most brilliant scholar, the author of` Some Remarks upon the Bile-Pigments, with special reference to Urobilin.'''

_The fairness of your friend was an open attraction; her firmness, you know, could only be understood by yourself.''_<br/>With your permission, I would ask the favor of an interview, as I feel strongly upon the subject, and have certain suggestions which I could only elaborate in a personal conversation.

_`` You are laughing; but, I assure you, Isabella is very firm in general.''_<br/>' I can be a very hard master when I like,' said he smiling.

_`` It is as much as should be said of anyone._<br/>`` Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.''

_To be always firm must be to be often obstinate._<br/>`` That would be more absurd still.''

_When properly to relax is the trial of judgment; and, without reference to my brother, I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour.''_<br/>I saw, too, that eccentricity was, as my uncle had told me, the fashion; and if the folk upon the Continent look upon us even to this day as being a nation of lunatics, it is no doubt a tradition handed down from the time when the only travellers whom they were likely to see were drawn from the class which I was now meeting.

_The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over; but then, as they walked about the room arm in arm, Isabella thus explained herself:`` I do not wonder at your surprise; and I am really fatigued to death._<br/>`` It is singular that I, who had never feared him in life, should be frightened at him now, and yet when I looked at him, and saw that all was motionless save the creeping stain upon the carpet, I was seized with a sudden foolish spasm of terror, and, catching up my knife, I fled swiftly and silently back to my own room, closing the panels behind me.

_He is such a rattle!_<br/>`` The death rattle!''

_Amusing enough, if my mind had been disengaged; but I would have given the world to sit still.''_<br/>` And now, who may you be to whom I owe this interference which shortened the affair, though mayhap the result would have been the same had you left us to settle it amongst ourselves?'

_`` Then why did not you?''_<br/>`` And why not?''

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_My dear!_<br/>dear!

_It would have looked so particular; and you know how I abhor doing that._<br/>You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter.

_I refused him as long as I possibly could, but he would take no denial._<br/>But as long as I can not there is no use pretending that I can.

_You have no idea how he pressed me._<br/>I had no idea of it.

_I begged him to excuse me, and get some other partner-- but no, not he; after aspiring to my hand, there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance, he wanted to be with me._<br/>How he took it I can not say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it was then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he managed to abstract some of the devil's- foot root.

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_Such nonsense!_<br/>Nonsense!

_I told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me; for, of all things in the world, I hated fine speeches and compliments; and so-- and so then I found there would be no peace if I did not stand up._<br/>It is no pleasant matter for me to dwell upon, yet, convinced as I am that there is no such thing as chance either in the great or the little things of this world, I am very sure that the sacrifices of these brave men were not thrown away, and that their strivings were not as profitless as might at first sight appear.

_Besides, I thought Mrs. Hughes, who introduced him, might take it ill if I did not: and your dear brother, I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening._<br/>When I thought of the way in which he had spoken of his unhappy friend, Lord Avon, upon the evening before, and of the emotion which he showed as he told the horrible story, I was glad to think that there was the heart of a man there, however much it might please him to conceal it.

_I am so glad it is over!_<br/>Oh, I am so glad.''

_My spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense: and then, being such a smart young fellow, I saw every eye was upon us.''_<br/>Two or three warriors spoke, and finally our young friend made a spirited harangue with such eloquent features and gestures that we could understand it all as clearly as if we had known his language.

_`` He is very handsome indeed.''_<br/>`` You are very good, sir.''

_`` Handsome!_<br/>`` James!''

_Yes, I suppose he may._<br/>Yes, I thought so.

_I dare say people would admire him in general; but he is not at all in my style of beauty._<br/>`` I know very well that I am not clever or anything of that sort, but still I would do all I can to make you very happy.

_I hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man._<br/>I can see him now with his foolish, angry eyes and his long, thin, puzzled face.

_However, he is very well._<br/>And he is most amazingly strong.

_Amazingly conceited, I am sure._<br/>You meant well, I am sure.''

_I took him down several times, you know, in my way.''_<br/>I took him in thousands, and here I am.''

_When the young ladies next met, they had a far more interesting subject to discuss._<br/> The lady, who had heard of his coming, was much surprised on learning of his departure.

_James Morland's second letter was then received, and the kind intentions of his father fully explained._<br/>When fully equipped, both Saxon and my father agreed that I had all that was requisite for a well-appointed soldier.

_A living, of which Mr. Morland was himself patron and incumbent, of about four hundred pounds yearly value, was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it; no trifling deduction from the family income, no niggardly assignment to one of ten children._<br/>`` I have already explained to our young friend here,'' said Challenger-LRB- he has a way of alluding to me as if I were a school child ten years old-RRB-,`` that it is quite impossible that there should be an easy way up anywhere, for the simple reason that if there were the summit would not be isolated, and those conditions would not obtain which have effected so singular an interference with the general laws of survival.

_An estate of at least equal value, moreover, was assured as his future inheritance._<br/>Here at least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost.

_James expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude; and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry, being, however unwelcome, no more than he had expected, was borne by him without discontent._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_Catherine, whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father's income, and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother, felt equally well satisfied, and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled._<br/> My mother seemed to speak with a hushed voice when she mentioned this wonderful brother of hers, and always had done as long as I can remember, so that I had learned also to have a subdued and reverent feeling when I heard his name.

_`` It is very charming indeed,'' said Isabella, with a grave face._<br/>`` That looks very nice and emancipated,'' said Ida, glancing round.

_`` Mr. Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed,'' said the gentle Mrs. Thorpe, looking anxiously at her daughter._<br/>Lady Holden was a small, alert woman with a kindly eye, and her expression as she glanced at him was a certificate of character to her husband.

_`` I only wish I could do as much._<br/>I could only think of one way of doing it.

_One could not expect more from him, you know._<br/>I do not know what to make of it.''

_If he finds he can do more by and by, I dare say he will, for I am sure he must be an excellent good-hearted man._<br/>For my own part, if I were only assured that I was as clever and brave as the average man about me, I should be well satisfied.

_Four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed, but your wishes, my dear Isabella, are so moderate, you do not consider how little you ever want, my dear.''_<br/>Twelve hundred pounds she's worth to me, Mary, my darling, and never again shall you soil your pretty fingers or pinch upon my beggarly pay.

_`` It is not on my own account I wish for more; but I can not bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland, making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life._<br/> It was a sight which I shall never forget until my dying day-- so weird, so impossible, that I do not know how I am to make you realize it, or how in a few years I shall bring myself to believe in it if I live to sit once more on a lounge in the Savage Club and look out on the drab solidity of the Embankment.

_For myself, it is nothing; I never think of myself.''_<br/>No, I have never heard of it.''

_`` I know you never do, my dear; and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you._<br/>' I am glad to hear you say so,' I answered,` for it makes it easier for me to say that I wish to go my own way, and to have nothing more to do with you.

_There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you, my dear child-- but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things._<br/>There was never a better or more hard-working wife, but she ai n't what you'd call a patron of sport, and that's a fact.''

_Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome, you know._<br/>Walker was very nice about it, and made the most handsome apologies.

_I always heard he was a most excellent man; and you know, my dear, we are not to suppose but what, if you had had a suitable fortune, he would have come down with something more, for I am sure he must be a most liberal-minded man.''_<br/>But I had not got half through my story, and Jim, like the good fellow that he was, had just begun to forget his own troubles in his delight at my good fortune, when my uncle called to me from without.

_`` Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do, I am sure._<br/>`` There's somebody knows something,'' said Belcher,`` and there's nobody has a better right to know what it is than we.

_But everybody has their failing, you know, and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money.''_<br/>But this other money will be enough to cover everything, and it is all my own.''

_Catherine was hurt by these insinuations._<br/>She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve.

_`` I am very sure,'' said she,`` that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford.''_<br/>`` I am sure,'' said she,`` that dear mother would like papa to do whatever would make him most happy.

_Isabella recollected herself._<br/> Clara stared.

_`` As to that, my sweet Catherine, there can not be a doubt, and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me._<br/>As to his brightness, it really does not matter, for his aunt, Mrs. Westmacott, is very rich, much richer than you would think from her style of living, and she has made him a handsome provision.''

_It is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits; I hate money; and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year, I should not have a wish unsatisfied._<br/>It is difficult to think that some fifteen or twenty messages from various sources of which I have personal notes, all agree, and yet are all wrong, nor is it easy to suppose that spirits can tell the truth about our world but untruth about their own.

_Ah!_<br/>Ah!

_my Catherine, you have found me out._<br/>Oh, Clara, I have it; I have it!

_There's the sting._<br/>That's the pinch.

_The long, long, endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living.''_<br/>But, after all, it seems to me that we are as far as ever from learning how your unfortunate brother met his death.''

_`` Yes, yes, my darling Isabella,'' said Mrs. Thorpe,`` we perfectly see into your heart._<br/>`` My dear Professor, let me congratulate you with all my heart.

_You have no disguise._<br/>You have no cause to doubt it.''

_We perfectly understand the present vexation; and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection.''_<br/>But he feared above all things lest he should offend her, and so put an end to their present pleasant intimacy.

_Catherine's uncomfortable feelings began to lessen._<br/> I began to feel uneasy.

_She endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella's regret; and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever, endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise._<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_James soon followed his letter, and was received with the most gratifying kindness._<br/> The minister explained in a few words that I had been received into the Emperor's personal service, and Josephine congratulated me upon it with the most kindly sympathy.

_CHAPTER 17  The Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath; and whether it should be the last was for some time a question, to which Catherine listened with a beating heart._<br/> Having got so far, Defoe remarked that he thought he had given them a fair start, and handed over the story to Dean Swift, who, after premising that he feared he would find himself as much at sea as Master Cyprian Overbeck Wells, continued in this way:-- `` For two days I drifted about in great distress, fearing that there should be a return of the gale, and keeping an eager look-out for my late companions.

_To have her acquaintance with the Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance._<br/>What did it matter to me if she hated the sound of his voice, or if he put every indignity upon her in the hope of breaking her spirit, and spoke to her as he would never have dared to speak to one of his servants?

_Her whole happiness seemed at stake, while the affair was in suspense, and everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings should be taken for another fortnight._<br/>But all of them had my honour and my fame at heart, and I felt that their grief would be tinged with pride when they learned how I had ridden and how I had fought upon this last day.

_What this additional fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made but a small part of Catherine's speculation._<br/> It was just three days after the Doctor and the Admiral had congratulated each other upon the closer tie which was to unite their two families, and to turn their friendship into something even dearer and more intimate, that Miss Ida Walker received a letter which caused her some surprise and considerable amusement.

_Once or twice indeed, since James's engagement had taught her what could be done, she had got so far as to indulge in a secret`` perhaps,'' but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views: the present was now comprised in another three weeks, and her happiness being certain for that period, the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite but little interest._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_In the course of the morning which saw this business arranged, she visited Miss Tilney, and poured forth her joyful feelings._<br/>This morning, however, for once, she found me in a listening mood, and with little prompting, proceeded to pour into my ears all that she knew of our beautiful visitor.

_It was doomed to be a day of trial._<br/>It is horrible to think of.

_No sooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen's lengthened stay than Miss Tilney told her of her father's having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Here was a blow!_<br/>It was a frightful blow.

_The past suspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment._<br/>In his whole life of struggle and success he had never felt such a glow of quiet contentment as suffused him at that instant when the grip of death was closing upon him.

_Catherine's countenance fell, and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed Miss Tilney's concluding words,`` By the end of another week!''_<br/>De Meneval has told me that for an hour at a time he has sometimes talked in this strain of the most intimate thoughts and aspirations of his heart, while his courtiers have stood round in silence waiting for the instant when he would return once more to his practical and incisive self.

_`` Yes, my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I think a fair trial._<br/> A look of relief passed over my father's honest face, for he was never very easy in his brother-in-law's company.

_He has been disappointed of some friends' arrival whom he expected to meet here, and as he is now pretty well, is in a hurry to get home.''_<br/>If his career in town has been a disappointment to me, the reason lies mainly in the fact that I am foolish enough to measure others by the standard which I have myself set.

_`` I am very sorry for it,'' said Catherine dejectedly;`` if I had known this before--'' `` Perhaps,'' said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner,`` you would be so good-- it would make me very happy if--''  The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility, which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_After addressing her with his usual politeness, he turned to his daughter and said,`` Well, Eleanor, may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend?''_<br/>Mrs. Harrison loved Jim as if he had been her own son, and her husband loved mine, so they came to my help, and may God bless them for their kindness to a distracted wife and mother!

_`` I was just beginning to make the request, sir, as you came in.''_<br/>`` Then I accept it, sir, and I am much obliged to you.''

_`` Well, proceed by all means._<br/>`` By all means.

_I know how much your heart is in it._<br/>But now I know how precious it is.

_My daughter, Miss Morland,'' he continued, without leaving his daughter time to speak,`` has been forming a very bold wish._<br/>` Now, sir,' she continued,' I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative.

_We leave Bath, as she has perhaps told you, on Saturday se` nnight._<br/>Now I've had another wire to say that she ca n't come to-morrow, but that she will pick up the ship at Falmouth on Wednesday.

_A letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home; and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here, some of my very old friends, there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath._<br/>The chance of my overhearing a story told by young Mr. Stone here, which showed me that some one was using the secret chambers of Cliffe Royal, convinced me that Lord Avon was in hiding there, and I lost no time in seeking him out and offering to do him all the justice in my power.''

_And could we carry our selfish point with you, we should leave it without a single regret._<br/>If I thought it would darken your life afterwards or be a sad recollection to you I would not say another word.''

_Can you, in short, be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire?_<br/>But, then, Champion Harrison told me how the fighting-men lived there, and my father how the heads of the Navy lived there, and my mother how her brother and his grand friends were there, until at last I was consumed with impatience to see this marvellous heart of England.

_I am almost ashamed to make the request, though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself._<br/>I am sorry to state that I have had to seriously complain of his conduct in the train, and I should be wanting in frankness if I did not say that it has left a most unpleasant impression in my mind.''

_Modesty such as yours-- but not for the world would I pain it by open praise._<br/>That is why their case is not more constantly before the public, for if their cry for redress was as great as their grievance it would fill the world to the exclusion of all others.

_If you can be induced to honour us with a visit, you will make us happy beyond expression._<br/>`` If you will let me know how your investigations go,'' he continued,`` I shall be happy to give you any help I can.

_'T is true, we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour, for our mode of living, as you see, is plain and unpretending; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable.''_<br/>As she could not speak a word of the language, however, and was unable to make any of the delinquents understand what it was that she wanted, her passage up the Nile left the immemorial East very much as she had found it, but afforded a good deal of sympathetic amusement to her fellow-travellers.

_Northanger Abbey!_<br/>`` Holyrood!''

_These were thrilling words, and wound up Catherine's feelings to the highest point of ecstasy._<br/>She was balanced upon a giddy pinnacle, the highest in the world, and yet the higher the deeper the fall.

_Her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness._<br/>The important, all-engrossing, delightful thing was that she could not look upon him as a casual acquaintance any more.

_To receive so flattering an invitation!_<br/>Well, well, to think o' that!

_To have her company so warmly solicited!_<br/>She will be glad to make your acquaintance.''

_Everything honourable and soothing, every present enjoyment, and every future hope was contained in it; and her acceptance, with only the saving clause of Papa and Mamma's approbation, was eagerly given._<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_`` I will write home directly,'' said she,`` and if they do not object, as I dare say they will not--''  General Tilney was not less sanguine, having already waited on her excellent friends in Pulteney Street, and obtained their sanction of his wishes._<br/>` It is your first entrance at Court, is it not, Monsieur de Laval,' said he, in his high-bred cordial manner;` you should not feel lonely, for there are certainly many friends of your father here who will be overjoyed to make the acquaintance of your father's son.

_`` Since they can consent to part with you,'' said he,`` we may expect philosophy from all the world.''_<br/>But I would fain have your name and style and what is it you purpose to do, so that we may perchance hear of each other in the years to come.

_Miss Tilney was earnest, though gentle, in her secondary civilities, and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to Fullerton would allow._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine's feelings through the varieties of suspense, security, and disappointment; but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss; and with spirits elated to rapture, with Henry at her heart, and Northanger Abbey on her lips, she hurried home to write her letter._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Mr. and Mrs. Morland, relying on the discretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted their daughter, felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under their eye, and sent therefore by return of post their ready consent to her visit in Gloucestershire._<br/>How close is the connection between kindred souls over there is shown by the way in which Myers, Gurney and Roden Noel, all friends and co-workers on earth, sent messages together through Mrs. Holland, who knew none of them, each message being characteristic to those who knew the men in life-- or the way in which Professor Verrall and Professor Butcher, both famous Greek scholars, collaborated to produce the Greek problem which has been analysed by Mr. Gerald Balfour in The Ear of Dionysius, with the result that that excellent authority testified that the effect COULD have been attained by no other entities, save only Verrall and Butcher.

_This indulgence, though not more than Catherine had hoped for, completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature, in friends and fortune, circumstance and chance._<br/>We do not recollect that there also everything is in proportion and in harmony so that the spirit scene or the spirit dwelling, which might seem a mere dream thing to us, is as actual to the spirit as are our own scenes or our own dwellings, and that the spirit body is as real and tangible to another spirit as ours to our friends.

_Everything seemed to cooperate for her advantage._<br/>On the contrary, all his attention seemed to be concentrated upon her answer.

_By the kindness of her first friends, the Allens, she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her._<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_Her feelings, her preferences, had each known the happiness of a return._<br/>Your visit hath been a joy to me, and your return will be the same to them.

_Wherever she felt attachment, she had been able to create it._<br/>We have been able to do it with ease.''

_The affection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister._<br/>She felt that it was settled, that he had come to ask her for her sister's hand.

_The Tilneys, they, by whom, above all, she desired to be favourably thought of, outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued._<br/>The widow might fascinate him by her knowledge of the world, her dash, her strength, her unconventionality-- all these qualities Clara was willing to allow her-- but she was convinced that she would be unendurable as a life companion.

_She was to be their chosen visitor, she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized-- and, in addition to all the rest, this roof was to be the roof of an abbey!_<br/>He was married to the second daughter of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir Lothian's descendants have their eye upon the property, they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them.

_Her passion for ancient edifices was next in degree to her passion for Henry Tilney-- and castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill._<br/>In his great goodness and self-abnegation he had, in his early declaration given forth at Lyme, declared that he should leave the choice of a monarch to the Commons of England, but having found that his enemies did most scandalously and basely make use of this his self-denial, and did assert that he had so little confidence in his own cause that he dared not take publicly the title which is due to him, he hath determined that this should have an end.

_To see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one, or the cloisters of the other, had been for many weeks a darling wish, though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_And yet, this was to happen._<br/>And yet what are we to do?''

_With all the chances against her of house, hall, place, park, court, and cottage, Northanger turned up an abbey, and she was to be its inhabitant._<br/>For Truth is a stern mistress, and when one hath once started off with her one must follow on after the jade, though she lead in flat defiance of all the rules and conditions which would fain turn that tangled wilderness the world into the trim Dutch garden of the story-tellers.

_Its long, damp passages, its narrow cells and ruined chapel, were to be within her daily reach, and she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends, some awful memorials of an injured and ill-fated nun._<br/>When I looked back upon my series of adventures, my wanderings in the salt-marsh, my entrance into the cottage, my discovery of the papers, my capture by the conspirators, the long period of suspense with Toussac's dreadful thumb upon my chin, and finally the moving scenes which I had witnessed-- the killing of the hound, the capture of Lesage, and the arrival of the soldiers-- I could not wonder that my nerves were overwrought, and that I surprised myself in little convulsive gestures, like those of a frightened child.

_It was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home, that the consciousness of it should be so meekly borne._<br/>`` To my surprise he demurred very much to the suggestion, and he explained that according to his religion it was an all-important matter that the body should be reunited after death, and so make a perfect dwelling for the spirit.

_The power of early habit only could account for it._<br/>-- and perhaps after all it is only a feeling peculiar to myself.

_A distinction to which they had been born gave no pride._<br/>But I had no pride of that sort.

_Their superiority of abode was no more to them than their superiority of person._<br/>I thought no more of its relation to my own nerves.

_Many were the inquiries she was eager to make of Miss Tilney; but so active were her thoughts, that when these inquiries were answered, she was hardly more assured than before, of Northanger Abbey having been a richly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation, of its having fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on its dissolution, of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the present dwelling although the rest was decayed, or of its standing low in a valley, sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak._<br/>For the wealthy dignitaries of the Church, rolling in their carriages to their cathedrals, in order to preach the doctrines of their Master, who wore His sandals out in tramping over the countryside, he professed the most bitter contempt; nor was he more lenient to those poorer members of the clergy who winked at the vices of their patrons that they might secure a seat at their table, and who would sit through a long evening of profanity rather than bid good-bye to the cheesecakes and the wine flask.

_CHAPTER 18  With a mind thus full of happiness, Catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away, without her seeing Isabella for more than a few minutes together._<br/>`` I waited as it seemed to me for at least an hour; but I had no watch, and my impatience was such that I dare say it really was little more than a quarter of that time.

_She began first to be sensible of this, and to sigh for her conversation, as she walked along the pump-room one morning, by Mrs. Allen's side, without anything to say or to hear; and scarcely had she felt a five minutes' longing of friendship, before the object of it appeared, and inviting her to a secret conference, led the way to a seat._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_`` This is my favourite place,'' said she as they sat down on a bench between the doors, which commanded a tolerable view of everybody entering at either;`` it is so out of the way.''_<br/>Encouraged by this concession, she gradually came to move the stool on which she sat nearer and nearer to my table, until after gaining a little every day during some weeks, she at last worked her way right up to me, and used to perch herself beside me whenever I worked.

_Catherine, observing that Isabella's eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other, as in eager expectation, and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch, thought the present a fine opportunity for being really so; and therefore gaily said,`` Do not be uneasy, Isabella, James will soon be here.''_<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_`` Psha!_<br/>_'' '' _ Egyptien!

_My dear creature,'' she replied,`` do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow._<br/>For my own part I was not so very anxious that she should save this craven lover of hers, whose handsome face belied the poor spirit within him.

_It would be hideous to be always together; we should be the jest of the place._<br/>To me it would seem a deplorable thing that we should in any way curtail by so much as a minute so wonderful an experience.''

_And so you are going to Northanger!_<br/>And so you go to the Duke of Beaufort!

_I am amazingly glad of it._<br/>I am so pleased.

_It is one of the finest old places in England, I understand._<br/>South America is a place I love, and I think, if you take it right through from Darien to Fuego, it's the grandest, richest, most wonderful bit of earth upon this planet.

_I shall depend upon a most particular description of it.''_<br/>Perhaps we shall come upon some other indications as we proceed.''

_`` You shall certainly have the best in my power to give._<br/>`` Oh, that's the best explanation you can give, is it?''

_But who are you looking for?_<br/>But who are the others?

_Are your sisters coming?''_<br/>`` Is your mother living?''

_`` I am not looking for anybody._<br/>`` I do not see any other way.''

_One's eyes must be somewhere, and you know what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine, when my thoughts are an hundred miles off._<br/>I suppose they were ten miles off from me, yet even at that distance one could observe how, from time to time, they twinkled or were obscured as someone passed before them.

_I am amazingly absent; I believe I am the most absent creature in the world._<br/>I am so sorry to cause you any disappointment, and I appreciate most highly the honour which you do me, but what you ask is quite impossible.''

_Tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp.''_<br/>It is true that your name is still proscribed, but my influence with the Emperor will set that matter right.

_`` But I thought, Isabella, you had something in particular to tell me?''_<br/> But now I had to think of myself.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Yes, and so I have._<br/>Yes, I thought so.

_But here is a proof of what I was saying._<br/>Now, what I thought is this.

_My poor head, I had quite forgot it._<br/>` But I had forgot.

_Well, the thing is this: I have just had a letter from John; you can guess the contents.''_<br/>Well, gentlemen, have I read you the riddle aright, or is there any point which you would query?''

_`` No, indeed, I can not.''_<br/>`` No, I can not.''

_`` My sweet love, do not be so abominably affected._<br/>`` I hope it's not very bad,'' he said.

_What can he write about, but yourself?_<br/>And then... And then... how can I tell you what happened then?

_You know he is over head and ears in love with you.''_<br/>He is very much in love with her, I assure you.

_`` With me, dear Isabella!''_<br/>`` My dear Clara!

_`` Nay, my sweetest Catherine, this is being quite absurd!_<br/>` Nay, John, you are too absurd!'

_Modesty, and all that, is very well in its way, but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming._<br/>Self-sacrifice is all very well, you know, but we have had rather too much of it on our side, and should like to see a little on the other.

_I have no idea of being so overstrained!_<br/>I had no idea of it.

_It is fishing for compliments._<br/>`` Od's fish!''

_His attentions were such as a child must have noticed._<br/>I had felt the fellow's grip upon my arms, and I knew that I would be a child in his hands.

_And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement._<br/>And yet my chance was a terribly long time coming, for many months had passed before the visit to Cliffe Royal gave me the opportunity which I longed for by day and dreamed of by night.

_He says so in this letter, says that he as good as made you an offer, and that you received his advances in the kindest way; and now he wants me to urge his suit, and say all manner of pretty things to you._<br/>He said that he wished to have your promise that they should all have very good reward if they helped you to escape.''

_So it is in vain to affect ignorance.''_<br/>If you do, all will be in vain.

_Catherine, with all the earnestness of truth, expressed her astonishment at such a charge, protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr. Thorpe's being in love with her, and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_`` As to any attentions on his side, I do declare, upon my honour, I never was sensible of them for a moment-- except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming._<br/>From that time I have never heard him allude to the matter, nor did he ever give us any reason why he should so confidently have expected the second coming upon that particular night.

_And as to making me an offer, or anything like it, there must be some unaccountable mistake._<br/>To prevent any painful thoughts, I may assure you once for all, dear, that it is nothing of which I need be ashamed.

_I could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind, you know!_<br/>I could not have believed it.

_And, as I ever wish to be believed, I solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us._<br/>From that time I have never heard him allude to the matter, nor did he ever give us any reason why he should so confidently have expected the second coming upon that particular night.

_The last half hour before he went away!_<br/>` It is a quarter of an hour since he got away.'

_It must be all and completely a mistake-- for I did not see him once that whole morning.''_<br/>`` My fellow-officers, whom I never saw until last night, will not be content unless they catch another glimpse of me the first thing this morning.''

_`` But that you certainly did, for you spent the whole morning in Edgar's Buildings-- it was the day your father's consent came-- and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house.''_<br/> But in spite of gleams of sunshine, there was thunder in the air, and Champion Harrison had just whispered in my ear that he was quite sure that we should never get through the night without trouble, and was advising me, if it got very bad, to take refuge under the table, when the landlord entered the room hurriedly and handed a note to my uncle.

_`` Are you?_<br/>`` Where are you?''

_Well, if you say it, it was so, I dare say-- but for the life of me, I can not recollect it._<br/>And yet it is so real with me, so entirely part of my very self, that I can not help acting upon it.

_I do remember now being with you, and seeing him as well as the rest-- but that we were ever alone for five minutes-- However, it is not worth arguing about, for whatever might pass on his side, you must be convinced, by my having no recollection of it, that I never thought, nor expected, nor wished for anything of the kind from him._<br/>It was not the first time, my friends, as you are well aware, and you know the reasons that I had to trust that neither nerve nor judgment would ever fail me.

_I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me-- but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side; I never had the smallest idea of it._<br/>I am so sorry to cause you any disappointment, and I appreciate most highly the honour which you do me, but what you ask is quite impossible.''

_Pray undeceive him as soon as you can, and tell him I beg his pardon-- that is-- I do not know what I ought to say-- but make him understand what I mean, in the properest way._<br/>If ye can indeed pray, and if your soul-cursing conventicles have not driven all grace out of ye, drop on your knees and offer up thanks when I tell ye that he hath ordained that ye shall all have a free pardon.'

_I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours, Isabella, I am sure; but you know very well that if I could think of one man more than another-- he is not the person.''_<br/>`` I will not say a word against our friend the Colonel, but it is not possible that a man should be fitted for everything.

_Isabella was silent._<br/>He was silent.

_`` My dear friend, you must not be angry with me._<br/>`` Do not be angry with us.

_I can not suppose your brother cares so very much about me._<br/>`` I can not see, however, how it affects your relation to my sister.''

_And, you know, we shall still be sisters.''_<br/>And then there were my mother and my sisters to be thought of.

_`` Yes, yes''-LRB- with a blush-RRB-,`` there are more ways than one of our being sisters._<br/> But her sister was of a more practical and less sentimental nature.

_But where am I wandering to?_<br/>But what do I see now?

_Well, my dear Catherine, the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John-- is not it so?''_<br/>For my own part I was not so very anxious that she should save this craven lover of hers, whose handsome face belied the poor spirit within him.

_`` I certainly can not return his affection, and as certainly never meant to encourage it.''_<br/>` It is true; and yet I never expected that I should be on such terms with you.

_`` Since that is the case, I am sure I shall not tease you any further._<br/>`` Well, of course, I am aware that there is not any what you might call DEFINITE evidence.

_John desired me to speak to you on the subject, and therefore I have._<br/>Oh, you must think him well over, for I want to speak to you about him.''

_But I confess, as soon as I read his letter, I thought it a very foolish, imprudent business, and not likely to promote the good of either; for what were you to live upon, supposing you came together?_<br/>I can not expect the story to be believed, but it is so singular that I should feel that it was a breach of duty if I did not put it upon record-- so here it is, and your belief or incredulity is your own affair.

_You have both of you something, to be sure, but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays; and after all that romancers may say, there is no doing without money._<br/>It seemed a poor return for all the courtesy which we encountered that we should deceive our hosts and benefactors, but under the circumstances we had really no alternative, and I hereby tell them that they will only waste their time and their money if they attempt to follow upon our traces.

_I only wonder John could think of it; he could not have received my last.''_<br/>It is not my first affair, and I dare bet that it will not be my last.

_`` You do acquit me, then, of anything wrong?_<br/>`` And have you anything to tell me?''

_-- You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother, never suspected him of liking me till this moment?''_<br/>I assure you, however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.''

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_As to that,'' answered Isabella laughingly,`` I do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been._<br/>I have, as I said, done Mortimer some turns which he might remember, though it did not become me to remind him of them.

_All that is best known to yourself._<br/>`` You know best what that is.

_A little harmless flirtation or so will occur, and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by._<br/>Should we clear ourselves, which is no very easy matter, the justice will at least want to know whence we come and whither we go, which may lead to inquiries that may bode us little good.

_But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely._<br/>It may be that I am mistaken, but I have every confidence in the correctness of my reasoning.''

_All those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits._<br/>` All things which love us and are necessary to our happiness in the world are with us here.'

_What one means one day, you know, one may not mean the next._<br/>You like one day what you can not abide the next.

_Circumstances change, opinions alter.''_<br/>`` You seem to be altering your opinions.

_`` But my opinion of your brother never did alter; it was always the same._<br/>`` I never knew you forget yourself before,'' said my uncle.

_You are describing what never happened.''_<br/>I thought that you were never coming.

_`` My dearest Catherine,'' continued the other without at all listening to her,`` I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about._<br/>` Madam,-- I would not take the boldness of writing to your Majesty till I had shown the King how I do abhor the thing that I have done, and how much I desire to live to serve him.

_I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother, because he is my brother, and who perhaps after all, you know, might be just as happy without you, for people seldom know what they would be at, young men especially, they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant._<br/>All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,-- for you have not done me a very good turn,-- but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.''

_What I say is, why should a brother's happiness be dearer to me than a friend's?_<br/>`` I was sure that you were not a man who, to clear yourself from a little money difficulty, would sacrifice the happiness of your mother and the health of your father.''

_You know I carry my notions of friendship pretty high._<br/>You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.

_But, above all things, my dear Catherine, do not be in a hurry._<br/>`` I'm not quite clear in my own mind how these things should be approached,-- if they are to be approached at all,-- but I am sure this is not the way.

_Take my word for it, that if you are in too great a hurry, you will certainly live to repent it._<br/>If I were sure that this would be done, it would be a great ease to my mind.'

_Tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections, and I believe he is very right._<br/>It is no pleasant matter for me to dwell upon, yet, convinced as I am that there is no such thing as chance either in the great or the little things of this world, I am very sure that the sacrifices of these brave men were not thrown away, and that their strivings were not as profitless as might at first sight appear.

_Ah!_<br/>Ah!

_Here he comes; never mind, he will not see us, I am sure.''_<br/>But here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself.''

_Catherine, looking up, perceived Captain Tilney; and Isabella, earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke, soon caught his notice._<br/>`` You will surely go in and see Mrs. Esdaile,'' she repeated, glancing up at him with eyes which had in them something between a challenge and a caress.

_He approached immediately, and took the seat to which her movements invited him._<br/>I began to ask him questions exactly as if he were seated before me, and he sent his answers back with great speed and decision.

_His first address made Catherine start._<br/>Thus I got at his address.''

_Though spoken low, she could distinguish,`` What!_<br/>`` Certainly,'' said she,`` I should be well if I could touch him.''

_Always to be watched, in person or by proxy!''_<br/>Whatever come, you always find me here.

_`` Psha, nonsense!''_<br/>`` Stuff and nonsense!''

_was Isabella's answer in the same half whisper._<br/>he said, and then again in a kind of whisper,`` Hale!''

_`` Why do you put such things into my head?_<br/>Why do you turn your eyes away from me?''

_If I could believe it-- my spirit, you know, is pretty independent.''_<br/>You did it very well, I must say that, and really I think that I like you better as you are.

_`` I wish your heart were independent._<br/>`` I wish you would.

_That would be enough for me.''_<br/>That was enough to decide me.

_`` My heart, indeed!_<br/> A heart!

_What can you have to do with hearts?_<br/>How could you have the heart to do it?

_You men have none of you any hearts.''_<br/>` Have we nothing to give the men?'

_`` If we have not hearts, we have eyes; and they give us torment enough.''_<br/>`` You wish to kill me,'' said I;`` it can not matter to you how I die.

_`` Do they?_<br/>`` And they?''

_I am sorry for it; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me._<br/>I am so sorry to have disturbed you with my foolishness.''

_I will look another way._<br/>I will do it.

_I hope this pleases you''-LRB- turning her back on him-RRB-;`` I hope your eyes are not tormented now.''_<br/>For my own part I was not so very anxious that she should save this craven lover of hers, whose handsome face belied the poor spirit within him.

_`` Never more so; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view-- at once too much and too little.''_<br/> Never in the world was a command obeyed so promptly as that one.

_Catherine heard all this, and quite out of countenance, could listen no longer._<br/> Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience, could contain himself no longer.

_Amazed that Isabella could endure it, and jealous for her brother, she rose up, and saying she should join Mrs. Allen, proposed their walking._<br/>Mrs. Harrison loved Jim as if he had been her own son, and her husband loved mine, so they came to my help, and may God bless them for their kindness to a distracted wife and mother!

_But for this Isabella showed no inclination._<br/>I had no time for it.

_She was so amazingly tired, and it was so odious to parade about the pump-room; and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters; she was expecting her sisters every moment; so that her dearest Catherine must excuse her, and must sit quietly down again._<br/>There was something in the gentleness of his rebuke, and in his appeal to her mother, which brought the tears to her eyes, and in another instant she would have been kneeling beside him with everything confessed, when the door flew open and her sister Ida came bounding into the room.

_But Catherine could be stubborn too; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home, she joined her and walked out of the pump-room, leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney._<br/>He hurried in, fearing that she might have taken some turn for the worse, but he was reassured to find her sitting up in her bed, with Clara and Ida Walker in attendance upon her.

_With much uneasiness did she thus leave them._<br/>And yet how powerless she was to prevent it!

_It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella, and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him; unconsciously it must be, for Isabella's attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement._<br/>It was agony to him to hear that she was about to straighten little Alec Turner's club-foot, and right at the fringe of the rumour came a note from his mother, the rector's wife, asking him if he would be so good as to act as chloroformist.

_To doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible; and yet, during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd._<br/>And yet she did not like this secrecy, this disinclination upon the part of one so frank and honest as Ida to tell her what was passing.

_She wished Isabella had talked more like her usual self, and not so much about money, and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney._<br/>She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.

_How strange that she should not perceive his admiration!_<br/>Do you not think that she may come to forget this man and to love me?''

_Catherine longed to give her a hint of it, to put her on her guard, and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother._<br/>The widow might fascinate him by her knowledge of the world, her dash, her strength, her unconventionality-- all these qualities Clara was willing to allow her-- but she was convinced that she would be unendurable as a life companion.

_The compliment of John Thorpe's affection did not make amends for this thoughtlessness in his sister._<br/>`` He shall not fall, Walker, and you shall not have occasion to be ashamed of the family into which your daughter is about to marry.

_She was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere; for she had not forgotten that he could mistake, and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious._<br/>The lady came, not altogether with the approval of her husband, and though she never gave indications of any very great psychic force, we were able, at least, to obtain those usual phenomena of message-tilting which are at the same time so puerile and so inexplicable.

_In vanity, therefore, she gained but little; her chief profit was in wonder._<br/>By degrees, however, as she came to realise my utter indifference, she became reconciled to the situation, and, as I have said before, profited by it, as our visitor performed much of the domestic work.

_That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment._<br/>But he feared above all things lest he should offend her, and so put an end to their present pleasant intimacy.

_Isabella talked of his attentions; she had never been sensible of any; but Isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste, and would never be said again; and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for present ease and comfort._<br/>They were never at their ease, always upon the brink of a catastrophe, encouraged one day only to be rudely rebuffed the next, bullied in public and slighted in private, and yet, in spite of it all, the singular fact remains that they loved him and served him as no monarch has been loved and served.

_CHAPTER 19  A few days passed away, and Catherine, though not allowing herself to suspect her friend, could not help watching her closely._<br/> My cousin had not said one word or taken any notice of my presence, but at this joining of our names she glanced at me with the same hostile expression which I had already remarked.

_The result of her observations was not agreeable._<br/>But the work was never congenial.

_Isabella seemed an altered creature._<br/>She was altered in some subtle way.

_When she saw her, indeed, surrounded only by their immediate friends in Edgar's Buildings or Pulteney Street, her change of manners was so trifling that, had it gone no farther, it might have passed unnoticed._<br/>She could wish nothing better than that Ida should be the wife of Harold Denver, and from the words which she had overheard as they left the lawn that evening, she could not doubt that there was some understanding between them.

_A something of languid indifference, or of that boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before, would occasionally come across her; but had nothing worse appeared, that might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_But when Catherine saw her in public, admitting Captain Tilney's attentions as readily as they were offered, and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles, the alteration became too positive to be passed over._<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_What could be meant by such unsteady conduct, what her friend could be at, was beyond her comprehension._<br/>`` If your friend,'' she said,`` would be good enough to stop, he might be of inestimable service to me.''

_Isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent._<br/>I could not but observe, however, that her fall was very carefully executed, and that she was fortunate enough, in spite of her insensibility, to arrange her drapery and attitude into a graceful and classical design.

_James was the sufferer._<br/>It was John!

_She saw him grave and uneasy; and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart, to her it was always an object._<br/>And yet this lonely beautiful woman, with the strong will and the loyal heart, had touched my feelings, and I felt that I would help her to anything-- even against my own better judgment, if she should desire it.

_For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned._<br/>`` I am so sorry to trouble you, dear Ida,'' she said.

_Though his looks did not please her, his name was a passport to her goodwill, and she thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment; for, in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump-room, his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella's engagement that she could not, upon reflection, imagine him aware of it._<br/>As she could not speak a word of the language, however, and was unable to make any of the delinquents understand what it was that she wanted, her passage up the Nile left the immemorial East very much as she had found it, but afforded a good deal of sympathetic amusement to her fellow-travellers.

_He might be jealous of her brother as a rival, but if more had seemed implied, the fault must have been in her misapprehension._<br/>She could but refuse me, and better be a repulsed lover than an accepted brother.

_She wished, by a gentle remonstrance, to remind Isabella of her situation, and make her aware of this double unkindness; but for remonstrance, either opportunity or comprehension was always against her._<br/>Sometimes his fierce taunts would bring some reply from the Empress, some gentle reproof to him for his gallantries, but each remonstrance only excited him to a fresh rush of vituperation.

_If able to suggest a hint, Isabella could never understand it._<br/>But if you refuse to speak, it is certain that you will never see her.

_In this distress, the intended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation; their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days, and Captain Tilney's removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing; he was not to be of the party to Northanger; he was to continue at Bath._<br/>` No doubt for state reasons the Emperor had to tamper a little with Mahomedanism, and I daresay he would attend this Church of St. Paul's as readily as he did the Mosque at Cairo; but it would not do for a ruler to be a bigot.

_When Catherine knew this, her resolution was directly made._<br/>I knew it,' said she.

_She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject, regretting his brother's evident partiality for Miss Thorpe, and entreating him to make known her prior engagement._<br/>But, then, Champion Harrison told me how the fighting-men lived there, and my father how the heads of the Navy lived there, and my mother how her brother and his grand friends were there, until at last I was consumed with impatience to see this marvellous heart of England.

_`` My brother does know it,'' was Henry's answer._<br/>` It was my father's before me,' I answered.

_`` Does he?_<br/>`` Is that he?''

_Then why does he stay here?''_<br/>What does he do then?

_He made no reply, and was beginning to talk of something else; but she eagerly continued,`` Why do not you persuade him to go away?_<br/> And they did talk about something else; but her left hand was still enclosed in his, and he knew, without asking again, that all was well.

_The longer he stays, the worse it will be for him at last._<br/>The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go.

_Pray advise him for his own sake, and for everybody's sake, to leave Bath directly._<br/>Ask him how he chanced to find How to leave the French behind, And he answers quick and smart,`` English climate's best for Art.''

_Absence will in time make him comfortable again; but he can have no hope here, and it is only staying to be miserable.''_<br/>He had made up his mind, and he would do it in any case, he said; but it rested with me whether his death should be happy and easy or whether it should be most miserable.

_Henry smiled and said,`` I am sure my brother would not wish to do that.''_<br/>`` Come in, Sir Charles, and I am convinced that you will acknowledge that I could not have done otherwise.

_`` Then you will persuade him to go away?''_<br/>`` You will let me try?''

_`` Persuasion is not at command; but pardon me, if I can not even endeavour to persuade him._<br/>`` Even that I can not do,'' he answered;`` but I doubt not that the landlord can inform us.''

_I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged._<br/>I think I hear them coming, Charles.

_He knows what he is about, and must be his own master.''_<br/>I answered that he must take the consequence of his own deed.

_`` No, he does not know what he is about,'' cried Catherine;`` he does not know the pain he is giving my brother._<br/>''` It was not I who killed her father,' he cried.

_Not that James has ever told me so, but I am sure he is very uncomfortable.''_<br/>He said that he could not very well understand you, nor you him, and so he came to me.''

_`` And are you sure it is my brother's doing?''_<br/>''` Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?'

_`` Yes, very sure.''_<br/>`` Yes, certainly.''

_`` Is it my brother's attentions to Miss Thorpe, or Miss Thorpe's admission of them, that gives the pain?''_<br/>`` Why,'' said I, with some pride,`` I ought to know it, seeing that my mother's brother, Sir Charles Tregellis, was the nearest friend of Lord Avon, and was at this card-party when the thing happened.

_`` Is not it the same thing?''_<br/>` Like not what?'

_`` I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference._<br/>`` Mr. Malone, I understand,'' said he.

_No man is offended by another man's admiration of the woman he loves; it is the woman only who can make it a torment.''_<br/>Doubtless a true man would have rendered this help to any damsel in distress, and yet it may add to your satisfaction to know that she whom you have served is no stranger to you.'

_Catherine blushed for her friend, and said,`` Isabella is wrong._<br/>`` And Clara is as bad, Clara who used to be so good and sweet, the very image of her poor mother.

_But I am sure she can not mean to torment, for she is very much attached to my brother._<br/>`` I can not see, however, how it affects your relation to my sister.''

_She has been in love with him ever since they first met, and while my father's consent was uncertain, she fretted herself almost into a fever._<br/>Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away and died within a month.

_You know she must be attached to him.''_<br/>You know him and understand him.

_`` I understand: she is in love with James, and flirts with Frederick.''_<br/>`` I tell you, Jinny, it's you and only you that I love,'' said he.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_no, not flirts._<br/>No, no.

_A woman in love with one man can not flirt with another.''_<br/>I have never looked with the eyes of love upon another woman.

_`` It is probable that she will neither love so well, nor flirt so well, as she might do either singly._<br/>` It is true; and yet I never expected that I should be on such terms with you.

_The gentlemen must each give up a little.''_<br/>You must give up all thought of it.''

_After a short pause, Catherine resumed with,`` Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother?''_<br/>`` It is a strange story,'' said Jim, thoughtfully;`` but when I asked my aunt about it, she would give me no answer; and as to my uncle, he cut me short at the very mention of it.''

_`` I can have no opinion on that subject.''_<br/>`` I have no doubt whatever upon the point.

_`` But what can your brother mean?_<br/>`` And your brother?''

_If he knows her engagement, what can he mean by his behaviour?''_<br/>If a man lead a life of virtue, what matter what he believes?

_`` You are a very close questioner.''_<br/>`` You are very good.''

_`` Am I?_<br/> And I?

_I only ask what I want to be told.''_<br/>I can only tell you what I know.

_`` But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell?''_<br/>`` But how could I tell?''

_`` Yes, I think so; for you must know your brother's heart.''_<br/>''` Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?'

_`` My brother's heart, as you term it, on the present occasion, I assure you I can only guess at.''_<br/>` Come, Sibylle,' said her father,` you can assure your cousin Louis that, so far as you are concerned, any family misunderstanding is at an end.'

_`` Well?''_<br/>`` Well?''

_`` Well!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Nay, if it is to be guesswork, let us all guess for ourselves._<br/>Nay, there is but one chance for us.

_To be guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful._<br/>My mission might be dismissed as useless.

_The premises are before you._<br/>And here you are, after all.''

_My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man; he has had about a week's acquaintance with your friend, and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her.''_<br/>I am old enough to remember your father when he was a young gallant, and you are his very double-- though I may say, without flattery, that where there is a difference it is in your favour.

_`` Well,'' said Catherine, after some moments' consideration,`` you may be able to guess at your brother's intentions from all this; but I am sure I can not._<br/>`` I knew you fairly well, sir, in our youth; but you will allow me to observe that neither I nor any friend of yours ever heard of a wife or a son.

_But is not your father uncomfortable about it?_<br/>But it is not as bad as you think.''

_Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away?_<br/>` Why should not Micah and I go ourselves?'

_Sure, if your father were to speak to him, he would go.''_<br/>But where is your nephew Jim, and how did you come to know that you would be needed?''

_`` My dear Miss Morland,'' said Henry,`` in this amiable solicitude for your brother's comfort, may you not be a little mistaken?_<br/>` It is your first entrance at Court, is it not, Monsieur de Laval,' said he, in his high-bred cordial manner;` you should not feel lonely, for there are certainly many friends of your father here who will be overjoyed to make the acquaintance of your father's son.

_Are you not carried a little too far?_<br/>You're not looking quite yourself.

_Would he thank you, either on his own account or Miss Thorpe's, for supposing that her affection, or at least her good behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney?_<br/>It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that at least she might never feel destitute.''

_Is he safe only in solitude?_<br/>`` Did you think, then, that you were the only man in the world with a taste for solitude?

_Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else?_<br/>It is for him to decide what he shall do, and then to do it without interference from anyone.

_He can not think this-- and you may be sure that he would not have you think it._<br/>He would not resent it so much if he had not something to fear from it.

_I will not say,` Do not be uneasy,' because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as little uneasy as you can._<br/>I do not know now whether I can save you, but at least I will try.''

_You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, that real jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration._<br/>I have no doubt that you feel the same way yourself, and that you would not care to stake the whole credit of the Gazette upon this adventure until we can meet the chorus of criticism and scepticism which such articles must of necessity elicit.

_Their hearts are open to each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant.''_<br/>You will allow that my fears of you were not unnatural, since neither your dress nor your appearance were such as one would expect to meet with in such a place and at such a time.'

_Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave, he added,`` Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us, he will probably remain but a very short time, perhaps only a few days behind us._<br/> My story is one which you may well treasure up in your memories, and tell again to others, for it is not likely that in this whole county of Hampshire, or even perhaps in all England, there is another left alive who is so well able to speak from his own knowledge of these events, or who has played a more forward part in them.

_His leave of absence will soon expire, and he must return to his regiment._<br/>It must reach him to-day, or his army will be left behind and destroyed.''

_And what will then be their acquaintance?_<br/>But what use will you make of it?''

_The mess-room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight, and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney's passion for a month.''_<br/>But, then, Champion Harrison told me how the fighting-men lived there, and my father how the heads of the Navy lived there, and my mother how her brother and his grand friends were there, until at last I was consumed with impatience to see this marvellous heart of England.

_Catherine would contend no longer against comfort._<br/>`` They will know no better.

_She had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech, but it now carried her captive._<br/>I had heard much of the beauty of the daughter of this Governor, but one day as I walked out with Parmes we met her, borne upon the shoulders of her slaves.

_Henry Tilney must know best._<br/>Now I will do my very best for you, Admiral!

_She blamed herself for the extent of her fears, and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again._<br/>But as to handing her over to you, when it is clear she fears and hates you, I wo n't do it.

_Her resolution was supported by Isabella's behaviour in their parting interview._<br/> She looked so beautiful in her enthusiasm that I nearly brought down the whole level of the interview.

_The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine's stay in Pulteney Street, and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness, or make her quit them in apprehension._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_James was in excellent spirits, and Isabella most engagingly placid._<br/>Hilary Joyce found himself in the presence of a short, thick-set officer, with a gentle voice and a placid expression which covered a remarkably acute and energetic spirit.

_Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart; but that at such a moment was allowable; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction, and once she drew back her hand; but Catherine remembered Henry's instructions, and placed it all to judicious affection._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_The embraces, tears, and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied._<br/>When our sins come to be weighed, much may be forgiven us for the sake of those unselfish days.''

_CHAPTER 20  Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry to lose their young friend, whose good humour and cheerfulness had made her a valuable companion, and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_Her happiness in going with Miss Tilney, however, prevented their wishing it otherwise; and, as they were to remain only one more week in Bath themselves, her quitting them now would not long be felt._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Mr. Allen attended her to Milsom Street, where she was to breakfast, and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends; but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family, and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right, and of not being able to preserve their good opinion, that, in the embarrassment of the first five minutes, she could almost have wished to return with him to Pulteney Street._<br/>How spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by Miss Julia Ames, who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication, but admitted, after fifteen years, that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over.

_Miss Tilney's manners and Henry's smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings; but still she was far from being at ease; nor could the incessant attentions of the general himself entirely reassure her._<br/> Reuben had said not a word since she had uncovered her face, and bore the face of a man who finds himself in some pleasant dream and is vexed only by the fear lest he wake up from it.

_Nay, perverse as it seemed, she doubted whether she might not have felt less, had she been less attended to._<br/>If love had not come to her yet, there was at least pity and sympathy, which are nearly akin to it.

_His anxiety for her comfort-- his continual solicitations that she would eat, and his often-expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste-- though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast-table-- made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_She felt utterly unworthy of such respect, and knew not how to reply to it._<br/>I would not believe them, I _ could _ not believe them-- for I did not know that there was upon this earth a thing so contemptible.

_Her tranquillity was not improved by the general's impatience for the appearance of his eldest son, nor by the displeasure he expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down._<br/>Never for an hour had she given him cause to regret it; but this lawyer brother of hers had, as I understood, offended my father by his slavish obsequiousness in days of prosperity and his venomous enmity in the days of trouble.

_She was quite pained by the severity of his father's reproof, which seemed disproportionate to the offence; and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture, and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her._<br/>It was agony to him to hear that she was about to straighten little Alec Turner's club-foot, and right at the fringe of the rumour came a note from his mother, the rector's wife, asking him if he would be so good as to act as chloroformist.

_This was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation, and she felt great compassion for Captain Tilney, without being able to hope for his goodwill._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_He listened to his father in silence, and attempted not any defence, which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind, on Isabella's account, might, by keeping him long sleepless, have been the real cause of his rising late._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_It was the first time of her being decidedly in his company, and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room; and even afterwards, so much were his spirits affected, she could distinguish nothing but these words, in a whisper to Eleanor,`` How glad I shall be when you are all off.''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The bustle of going was not pleasant._<br/> But retreat was not so easy.

_The clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down, and the general had fixed to be out of Milsom Street by that hour._<br/>The clock was on the stroke of eleven as we returned to our own men, and at that very moment King Monmouth rode out from the inn where he was quartered, and trotted with his staff down the High Street.

_His greatcoat, instead of being brought for him to put on directly, was spread out in the curricle in which he was to accompany his son._<br/>The groom was away, and I had to send a lad in search of him, while with the help of the livery-man I dragged the curricle from the coach-house and brought the two mares out of their stalls.

_The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out, though there were three people to go in it, and his daughter's maid had so crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to sit; and, so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed her in, that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing-desk from being thrown out into the street._<br/>When I looked back upon my series of adventures, my wanderings in the salt-marsh, my entrance into the cottage, my discovery of the papers, my capture by the conspirators, the long period of suspense with Toussac's dreadful thumb upon my chin, and finally the moving scenes which I had witnessed-- the killing of the hound, the capture of Lesage, and the arrival of the soldiers-- I could not wonder that my nerves were overwrought, and that I surprised myself in little convulsive gestures, like those of a frightened child.

_At last, however, the door was closed upon the three females, and they set off at the sober pace in which the handsome, highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles: such was the distance of Northanger from Bath, to be now divided into two equal stages._<br/>There we left him then in the dim-lit London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman, while without, at the edge of the Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with it, his victory, which confined Napoleon's ambition for ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.

_Catherine's spirits revived as they drove from the door; for with Miss Tilney she felt no restraint; and, with the interest of a road entirely new to her, of an abbey before, and a curricle behind, she caught the last view of Bath without any regret, and met with every milestone before she expected it._<br/>She went on to say that the sphere she inhabited was all round the earth; that she knew about the planets; that Mars was inhabited by a race more advanced than us, and that the canals were artificial; there was no bodily pain in her sphere, but there could be mental anxiety; they were governed; they took nourishment; she had been a Catholic and was still a Catholic, but had not fared better than the Protestants; there were Buddhists and Mohammedans in her sphere, but all fared alike; she had never seen Christ and knew no more about Him than on earth, but believed in His influence; spirits prayed and they died in their new sphere before entering another; they had pleasures-- music was among them.

_The tediousness of a two hours' wait at Petty France, in which there was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry, and loiter about without anything to see, next followed-- and her admiration of the style in which they travelled, of the fashionable chaise and four-- postilions handsomely liveried, rising so regularly in their stirrups, and numerous outriders properly mounted, sunk a little under this consequent inconvenience._<br/>There we left him then in the dim-lit London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman, while without, at the edge of the Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with it, his victory, which confined Napoleon's ambition for ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.

_Had their party been perfectly agreeable, the delay would have been nothing; but General Tilney, though so charming a man, seemed always a check upon his children's spirits, and scarcely anything was said but by himself; the observation of which, with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded, and his angry impatience at the waiters, made Catherine grow every moment more in awe of him, and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_At last, however, the order of release was given; and much was Catherine then surprised by the general's proposal of her taking his place in his son's curricle for the rest of the journey:`` the day was fine, and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible.''_<br/>And yet, so strong is habit, that, even in this extremity of emotion he assumed the deferential air of the high-class valet, and his sentences formed themselves in the sonorous fashion which had struck my attention upon that first day when the curricle of my uncle had stopped outside my father's door.

_The remembrance of Mr. Allen's opinion, respecting young men's open carriages, made her blush at the mention of such a plan, and her first thought was to decline it; but her second was of greater deference for General Tilney's judgment; he could not propose anything improper for her; and, in the course of a few minutes, she found herself with Henry in the curricle, as happy a being as ever existed._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_A very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world; the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur, to be sure, but it was a heavy and troublesome business, and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at Petty France._<br/>There we left him then in the dim-lit London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman, while without, at the edge of the Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with it, his victory, which confined Napoleon's ambition for ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.

_Half the time would have been enough for the curricle, and so nimbly were the light horses disposed to move, that, had not the general chosen to have his own carriage lead the way, they could have passed it with ease in half a minute._<br/>Never have I travelled at such a pace, and never have I felt such a sense of exhilaration from the rush of keen upland air upon our faces, and from the sight of those two glorious creatures stretched to their utmost, with the roar of their hoofs and the rattle of our wheels as the light curricle bounded and swayed behind them.

_But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses; Henry drove so well-- so quietly-- without making any disturbance, without parading to her, or swearing at them: so different from the only gentleman-coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with!_<br/>I took the precaution of walking the horse very quietly until we were some distance from the house, for I had told Reuben nothing of my intended journey, and I was convinced that if he knew of it neither discipline, nor even his new ties of love, would prevent him from coming with me.

_And then his hat sat so well, and the innumerable capes of his greatcoat looked so becomingly important!_<br/>As he stood, with the high collar of his greatcoat raised to his ears, he might have seen from the reflection in the glass-case before him that his appearance was a singular one.

_To be driven by him, next to being dancing with him, was certainly the greatest happiness in the world._<br/>At this supreme moment all the great deeds of my life rose in a vision before me, and I felt that this, my last exploit, was indeed a worthy close to such a career.

_In addition to every other delight, she had now that of listening to her own praise; of being thanked at least, on his sister's account, for her kindness in thus becoming her visitor; of hearing it ranked as real friendship, and described as creating real gratitude._<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_His sister, he said, was uncomfortably circumstanced-- she had no female companion-- and, in the frequent absence of her father, was sometimes without any companion at all._<br/>`` I should be loath to exercise any undue pressure upon my sister Ada; but I have given her to understand that there is no one whom I should prefer for a brother-in-law to my most brilliant scholar, the author of` Some Remarks upon the Bile-Pigments, with special reference to Urobilin.'''

_`` But how can that be?''_<br/>`` Then what can it be?''

_said Catherine._<br/>said Mary.

_`` Are not you with her?''_<br/>Is not this so?''

_`` Northanger is not more than half my home; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston, which is nearly twenty miles from my father's, and some of my time is necessarily spent there.''_<br/> My uncle's fears as to our being blocked upon the road were only too well founded, for after we passed Reigate there was such a procession of every sort of vehicle, that I believe for the whole eight miles there was not a horse whose nose was further than a few feet from the back of the curricle or barouche in front.

_`` How sorry you must be for that!''_<br/>`` How dear of you to say that!

_`` I am always sorry to leave Eleanor.''_<br/>`` I am sorry to have kept you waiting.

_`` Yes; but besides your affection for her, you must be so fond of the abbey!_<br/>`` I thank you, sir, for the kind interest which you take in me,'' said I. `` But you must be a credit to me.

_After being used to such a home as the abbey, an ordinary parsonage-house must be very disagreeable.''_<br/>It is difficult to imagine, then, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon the company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and elaborate an attempt.

_He smiled, and said,`` You have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey.''_<br/>' I have thought better of it,' he answered, with a smile.

_`` To be sure, I have._<br/>`` And so have I.

_Is not it a fine old place, just like what one reads about?''_<br/>You can not expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch!

_`` And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as` what one reads about' may produce?_<br/>`` If you will read our philosophers, and above all the divine Plato, you will find that there are other guides who may take you to the same end.

_Have you a stout heart?_<br/>Have you a clue?''

_Nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry?''_<br/>Quick, behind the tapestry!''

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_yes-- I do not think I should be easily frightened, because there would be so many people in the house-- and besides, it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years, and then the family come back to it unawares, without giving any notice, as generally happens.''_<br/>After many adventures which I need not describe, and after traveling a distance which I will not mention, in a direction which I withhold, we came at last to a tract of country which has never been described, nor, indeed, visited save by my unfortunate predecessor.

_`` No, certainly._<br/>`` No, indeed.''

_We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire-- nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows, doors, or furniture._<br/>On arriving at the Castle we found that the King had not yet come out from his chamber, but we were shown into the great hall to await him, a fine room with lofty windows and a noble ceiling of carved woodwork.

_But you must be aware that when a young lady is-LRB- by whatever means-RRB- introduced into a dwelling of this kind, she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family._<br/>I am aware that all these accounts of life beyond the grave differ in detail-- I suppose any of our accounts of the present life would differ in detail-- but in the main there is a very great resemblance, which in this instance was very far from the conception either of myself or of either of the two ladies who made up the circle.

_While they snugly repair to their own end of the house, she is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient housekeeper, up a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages, into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Can you stand such a ceremony as this?_<br/>How dare you stand in my way?'

_Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber-- too lofty and extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size-- its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even a funereal appearance?_<br/>The height of the trees and the thickness of the boles exceeded anything which I in my town-bred life could have imagined, shooting upwards in magnificent columns until, at an enormous distance above our heads, we could dimly discern the spot where they threw out their side-branches into Gothic upward curves which coalesced to form one great matted roof of verdure, through which only an occasional golden ray of sunshine shot downwards to trace a thin dazzling line of light amidst the majestic obscurity.

_Will not your heart sink within you?''_<br/>Have you not all that heart could desire?

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_But this will not happen to me, I am sure.''_<br/>I am not likely to forget it.''

_`` How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment!_<br/>` Shall we take him to the strong room, your Grace?'

_And what will you discern?_<br/>But what use will you make of it?''

_Not tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers, but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute, on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open, and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior, whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it._<br/>Is it not a shocking thing-- a thing to drive a reasoning man into absolute Materialism-- to think that you may have a fine, noble fellow with every divine instinct and that some little vascular change, the dropping, we will say, of a minute spicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on to the surface of his brain may have the effect of changing him to a filthy and pitiable creature with every low and debasing tendency?

_Dorothy, meanwhile, no less struck by your appearance, gazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few unintelligible hints._<br/>Finding that in my weak and dazed state all efforts were of no avail, I lay sullen and watchful, taking no heed of the random blows which were still showered upon me.

_To raise your spirits, moreover, she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted, and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call._<br/>As she could not speak a word of the language, however, and was unable to make any of the delinquents understand what it was that she wanted, her passage up the Nile left the immemorial East very much as she had found it, but afforded a good deal of sympathetic amusement to her fellow-travellers.

_With this parting cordial she curtsies off-- you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you-- and when, with fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover, with increased alarm, that it has no lock.''_<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Mr. Tilney, how frightful!_<br/>Lucy, dear, it was dreadful!''

_This is just like a book!_<br/>It was just as you say.

_But it can not really happen to me._<br/>But it would not do!

_I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy._<br/>You are my Gladys, are you not-- little Gladys Hungerton?''

_Well, what then?''_<br/>How now, then?

_`` Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night._<br/>`` Of course after that there was nothing more to be done.

_After surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed, you will retire to rest, and get a few hours' unquiet slumber._<br/>It may have been the hypnotic lullaby of this gentle susurrus, or it may have been the result of my tiring day, but after many dozings and many efforts to regain my clearness of perception, I fell at last into a deep and dreamless sleep.

_But on the second, or at farthest the third night after your arrival, you will probably have a violent storm._<br/>At eleven it had increased to a gale, and by midnight the most furious storm was raging which I ever remember upon that weather-beaten coast.

_Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains-- and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it, you will probably think you discern-LRB- for your lamp is not extinguished-RRB- one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest._<br/> Now this poor reward of merit Rankled so in Peter's spirit, It was more than he could bear;-LSB- 17-RSB- So one night in mad despair He took his canvas for the year-LRB-`` Isle of Wight from Southsea Pier''-RRB-, And he hurled it from his sight, Hurled it blindly to the night, Saw it fall diminuendo From the open lattice window, Till it landed with a flop On the dust-bin's ashen top, Where,` mid damp and rain and grime, It remained till morning time.

_Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it, you will instantly arise, and throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to examine this mystery._<br/>While doing so, I shall make it my business, with infinite tact and delicacy, to throw out a few remarks which may arouse the interest of the audience and cause some of them to desire to go more deeply into the matter.

_After a very short search, you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection, and on opening it, a door will immediately appear-- which door, being only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you will, after a few efforts, succeed in opening-- and, with your lamp in your hand, will pass through it into a small vaulted room.''_<br/>It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones's well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found.

_`` No, indeed; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing.''_<br/>`` I'm not much afraid of anything.''

_`` What!_<br/>`` What!''

_Not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony, scarcely two miles off?_<br/>Of course, it must be the same chalk quarry into which the underground passage of Grosbois opened, and no doubt during his treasonable meetings with my uncle he had learned the secret.

_Could you shrink from so simple an adventure?_<br/>Could you help me so far?''

_No, no, you will proceed into this small vaulted room, and through this into several others, without perceiving anything very remarkable in either._<br/>No, Mr. Malone, I will place no restriction upon your correspondence, since the ventilation of the facts is the object of your journey; but I demand that you shall give no particulars as to your exact destination, and that nothing be actually published until your return.

_In one perhaps there may be a dagger, in another a few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way, and your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return towards your own apartment._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_In repassing through the small vaulted room, however, your eyes will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold, which, though narrowly examining the furniture before, you had passed unnoticed._<br/>`` Perhaps you will think that this is an imitation also,'' said Lytton bitterly, and leaning back in his chair with a morose countenance, he continued the narrative in this way:-- `` Our unfortunate hero had hardly stretched himself upon the straw with which his dungeon was littered, when a secret door opened in the wall and a venerable old man swept majestically into the apartment.

_Impelled by an irresistible presentiment, you will eagerly advance to it, unlock its folding doors, and search into every drawer-- but for some time without discovering anything of importance-- perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds._<br/>Yet when we think how narrow and how devious this path of Nature is, how dimly we can trace it, for all our lamps of science, and how from the darkness which girds it round great and terrible possibilities loom ever shadowly upwards, it is a bold and confident man who will put a limit to the strange by-paths into which the human spirit may wander.

_At last, however, by touching a secret spring, an inner compartment will open-- a roll of paper appears-- you seize it-- it contains many sheets of manuscript-- you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber, but scarcely have you been able to decipher` Oh!_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Thou-- whomsoever thou mayst be, into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may fall'-- when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket, and leaves you in total darkness.''_<br/>' I falter where I firmly trod, And falling with my weight of cares Upon the great world's altar stairs, Which slope through darkness up to God, ' I stretch lame hands of faith and grope And gather dust and chaff, and call To what I feel is Lord of all, And faintly trust the larger hope.'

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_No, no-- do not say so._<br/>No, no.

_Well, go on.''_<br/>Now go.''

_But Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther; he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice, and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of Matilda's woes._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_Catherine, recollecting herself, grew ashamed of her eagerness, and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what he related._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_`` Miss Tilney, she was sure, would never put her into such a chamber as he had described!_<br/>Again, if Miss Julia Ames can tell Mr. Stead things in her own earth life of which he could not have cognisance, and if those things are shown, when tested, to be true, then one is more inclined to think that those things which can not be tested are true also.

_She was not at all afraid.''_<br/>And she is not afraid of the Emperor.

_As they drew near the end of their journey, her impatience for a sight of the abbey-- for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects very different-- returned in full force, and every bend in the road was expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey stone, rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks, with the last beams of the sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high Gothic windows._<br/> All this I shall some day write at fuller length, and amidst these more stirring days I would tenderly sketch in these lovely summer evenings, when with the deep blue sky above us we lay in good comradeship among the long grasses by the wood and marveled at the strange fowl that swept over us and the quaint new creatures which crept from their burrows to watch us, while above us the boughs of the bushes were heavy with luscious fruit, and below us strange and lovely flowers peeped at us from among the herbage; or those long moonlit nights when we lay out upon the shimmering surface of the great lake and watched with wonder and awe the huge circles rippling out from the sudden splash of some fantastic monster; or the greenish gleam, far down in the deep water, of some strange creature upon the confines of darkness.

_But so low did the building stand, that she found herself passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger, without having discerned even an antique chimney._<br/>I have some dim remembrance of an ancient church upon an eminence, and of a quaint stone cross within the market-place, but assuredly, of all the recollections which I retain of Bruton there is none so pleasing as that of the buxom landlady's face, and of the steaming dishes which she lost no time in setting before us.

_She knew not that she had any right to be surprised, but there was a something in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected._<br/>`` No one who was not good could be so absolutely happy as she seems to be.

_To pass between lodges of a modern appearance, to find herself with such ease in the very precincts of the abbey, and driven so rapidly along a smooth, level road of fine gravel, without obstacle, alarm, or solemnity of any kind, struck her as odd and inconsistent._<br/>The height of the trees and the thickness of the boles exceeded anything which I in my town-bred life could have imagined, shooting upwards in magnificent columns until, at an enormous distance above our heads, we could dimly discern the spot where they threw out their side-branches into Gothic upward curves which coalesced to form one great matted roof of verdure, through which only an occasional golden ray of sunshine shot downwards to trace a thin dazzling line of light amidst the majestic obscurity.

_She was not long at leisure, however, for such considerations._<br/>It is not a matter on which I can well speak to her direct.

_A sudden scud of rain, driving full in her face, made it impossible for her to observe anything further, and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw bonnet; and she was actually under the abbey walls, was springing, with Henry's assistance, from the carriage, was beneath the shelter of the old porch, and had even passed on to the hall, where her friend and the general were waiting to welcome her, without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to herself, or one moment's suspicion of any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice._<br/> Now this poor reward of merit Rankled so in Peter's spirit, It was more than he could bear;-LSB- 17-RSB- So one night in mad despair He took his canvas for the year-LRB-`` Isle of Wight from Southsea Pier''-RRB-, And he hurled it from his sight, Hurled it blindly to the night, Saw it fall diminuendo From the open lattice window, Till it landed with a flop On the dust-bin's ashen top, Where,` mid damp and rain and grime, It remained till morning time.

_The breeze had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her; it had wafted nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain; and having given a good shake to her habit, she was ready to be shown into the common drawing-room, and capable of considering where she was._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_An abbey!_<br/>`` Holyrood!''

_Yes, it was delightful to be really in an abbey!_<br/>Oh, it was glorious!

_But she doubted, as she looked round the room, whether anything within her observation would have given her the consciousness._<br/>And yet it was inconceivable that an undergraduate could keep a woman in his rooms without being instantly detected.

_The furniture was in all the profusion and elegance of modern taste._<br/>Some little tour-de-force of the sort is in excellent taste.

_The fireplace, where she had expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times, was contracted to a Rumford, with slabs of plain though handsome marble, and ornaments over it of the prettiest English china._<br/>Marbles and gold, velvet and silver, glittering mosaics, wonderful carvings, ivory screens, curtains of Armenian tissue and of Indian silk, damask from Arabia, and amber from the Baltic-- all these things merged themselves in the minds of the two simple provincials, until their eyes ached and their senses reeled before the blaze and the glory of this, the most magnificent of the dwellings of man.

_The windows, to which she looked with peculiar dependence, from having heard the general talk of his preserving them in their Gothic form with reverential care, were yet less what her fancy had portrayed._<br/>As she could not speak a word of the language, however, and was unable to make any of the delinquents understand what it was that she wanted, her passage up the Nile left the immemorial East very much as she had found it, but afforded a good deal of sympathetic amusement to her fellow-travellers.

_To be sure, the pointed arch was preserved-- the form of them was Gothic-- they might be even casements-- but every pane was so large, so clear, so light!_<br/>The height of the trees and the thickness of the boles exceeded anything which I in my town-bred life could have imagined, shooting upwards in magnificent columns until, at an enormous distance above our heads, we could dimly discern the spot where they threw out their side-branches into Gothic upward curves which coalesced to form one great matted roof of verdure, through which only an occasional golden ray of sunshine shot downwards to trace a thin dazzling line of light amidst the majestic obscurity.

_To an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions, and the heaviest stone-work, for painted glass, dirt, and cobwebs, the difference was very distressing._<br/>The height of the trees and the thickness of the boles exceeded anything which I in my town-bred life could have imagined, shooting upwards in magnificent columns until, at an enormous distance above our heads, we could dimly discern the spot where they threw out their side-branches into Gothic upward curves which coalesced to form one great matted roof of verdure, through which only an occasional golden ray of sunshine shot downwards to trace a thin dazzling line of light amidst the majestic obscurity.

_The general, perceiving how her eye was employed, began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture, where everything, being for daily use, pretended only to comfort, etc.; flattering himself, however, that there were some apartments in the Abbey not unworthy her notice-- and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding of one in particular, when, taking out his watch, he stopped short to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five!_<br/> Professor Challenger answered that Mr. Summerlee appeared to be confusing the Amazon with the Thames; that it was in reality a somewhat larger river; that Mr. Summerlee might be interested to know that with the Orinoco, which communicated with it, some fifty thousand miles of country were opened up, and that in so vast a space it was not impossible for one person to find what another had missed.

_This seemed the word of separation, and Catherine found herself hurried away by Miss Tilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest punctuality to the family hours would be expected at Northanger._<br/>He was married to the second daughter of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir Lothian's descendants have their eye upon the property, they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them.

_Returning through the large and lofty hall, they ascended a broad staircase of shining oak, which, after many flights and many landing-places, brought them upon a long, wide gallery._<br/> Following our fair guide we passed into a very large and lofty room, the walls of which were wainscoted with carved oak, and hung at either end with tapestry.

_On one side it had a range of doors, and it was lighted on the other by windows which Catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle, before Miss Tilney led the way into a chamber, and scarcely staying to hope she would find it comfortable, left her with an anxious entreaty that she would make as little alteration as possible in her dress._<br/>It was but for an instant, and yet that momentary view struck a thrill of fear and astonishment through me, for in my very path, not twenty yards before me, there stood a woman, the livid light beating upon her face and showing up every detail of her dress and features.

_CHAPTER 21  A moment's glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_It was by no means unreasonably large, and contained neither tapestry nor velvet._<br/>There was no sign of the monster, however, nor could I hear any sound from above.

_The walls were papered, the floor was carpeted; the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those of the drawing-room below; the furniture, though not of the latest fashion, was handsome and comfortable, and the air of the room altogether far from uncheerful._<br/>On arriving at the Castle we found that the King had not yet come out from his chamber, but we were shown into the great hall to await him, a fine room with lofty windows and a noble ceiling of carved woodwork.

_Her heart instantaneously at ease on this point, she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything, as she greatly dreaded disobliging the general by any delay._<br/>At no time would he show him any mark of respect, and my temper often rose within me when I saw the quiet acquiescence of the old Doctor, and his patient tolerance of this monstrous treatment.

_Her habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste, and she was preparing to unpin the linen package, which the chaise-seat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation, when her eye suddenly fell on a large high chest, standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_The sight of it made her start; and, forgetting everything else, she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder, while these thoughts crossed her: `` This is strange indeed!_<br/> His words died away into a whisper, and we all stood in motionless amazement.

_I did not expect such a sight as this!_<br/>`` I did not dare to think it.''

_An immense heavy chest!_<br/>That monstrous breadth of shoulder!

_What can it hold?_<br/>What can it be?

_Why should it be placed here?_<br/>Why then should we exist?'

_Pushed back too, as if meant to be out of sight!_<br/>Look up and see if you can see aught of it.'

_I will look into it-- cost me what it may, I will look into it-- and directly too-- by daylight._<br/>Long before I could pass the lines it would be broad daylight.

_If I stay till evening my candle may go out.''_<br/>I remember also my wondering whether I could get home before midnight.

_She advanced and examined it closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some darker wood, and raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved stand of the same._<br/> She was still gazing at the brown medal and wondering what the`` Dulce et decorum est'' might mean, which was inscribed upon the edge, when there came a sudden tapping and shuffling upon the stair, and there at the door was standing the very man who had been so often in her thoughts.

_The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at each end were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken perhaps prematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the lid, was a mysterious cipher, in the same metal._<br/>Is it not a shocking thing-- a thing to drive a reasoning man into absolute Materialism-- to think that you may have a fine, noble fellow with every divine instinct and that some little vascular change, the dropping, we will say, of a minute spicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on to the surface of his brain may have the effect of changing him to a filthy and pitiable creature with every low and debasing tendency?

_Catherine bent over it intently, but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty._<br/>`` I admit your plateau, because I have seen it; but I have not as yet satisfied myself that it contains any form of life whatever.''

_She could not, in whatever direction she took it, believe the last letter to be a T; and yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment._<br/>I have no doubt that you feel the same way yourself, and that you would not care to stake the whole credit of the Gazette upon this adventure until we can meet the chorus of criticism and scepticism which such articles must of necessity elicit.

_If not originally theirs, by what strange events could it have fallen into the Tilney family?_<br/>`` If I am not mistaken, there is some possibility of another matrimonial event occurring in the family.

_Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater; and seizing, with trembling hands, the hasp of the lock, she resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at least as to its contents._<br/> We all looked from one to the other, but though many faces were doubtful or desponding, none had a word to say against the night attack, for it was clear that our action in any case must be hazardous, and this had at least the merit of promising a better chance of success than any other.

_With difficulty, for something seemed to resist her efforts, she raised the lid a few inches; but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her, starting, quit her hold, and the lid closed with alarming violence._<br/>`` It is singular that I, who had never feared him in life, should be frightened at him now, and yet when I looked at him, and saw that all was motionless save the creeping stain upon the carpet, I was seized with a sudden foolish spasm of terror, and, catching up my knife, I fled swiftly and silently back to my own room, closing the panels behind me.

_This ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney's maid, sent by her mistress to be of use to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her, it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing, and forced her, in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to proceed in her dressing without further delay._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_Her progress was not quick, for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm; and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt, she could not remain many paces from the chest._<br/>She not being herewith satisfied at the first attempt of touching his glove only, but her mind was she must touch some part of his bare skin, she, weighing his coming forth, intended a second attempt.

_At length, however, having slipped one arm into her gown, her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be indulged._<br/>At this she seemed somewhat hurt, and the tears sprang into her eyes, but she followed me into the sitting-room and watched me wistfully.

_One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperate should be the exertion of her strength, that, unless secured by supernatural means, the lid in one moment should be thrown back._<br/>So far all had been kindly, however far apart our desires might be; but we felt well assured that our actual plans of a descent must be kept secret, for we had reason to fear that at the last they might try to hold us by force.

_With this spirit she sprang forward, and her confidence did not deceive her._<br/>And yet she did not like this secrecy, this disinclination upon the part of one so frank and honest as Ida to tell her what was passing.

_Her resolute effort threw back the lid, and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane, properly folded, reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession!_<br/>Her queenly figure was moulded upon large and noble lines, while her face, though already tending to become somewhat heavy and coarse, was still remarkable for the brilliancy of the complexion, the beauty of the large, light blue eyes, and the tinge of the dark hair which curled over the low white forehead.

_She was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney, anxious for her friend's being ready, entered the room, and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation, was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search._<br/>*****  It was the eve of my departure from Kirkby-Malhouse that we sat upon the green bank in the garden, she with dark, dreamy eyes looking sadly out over the sombre fells; while I, with a book upon my knee, glanced covertly at her lovely profile and marvelled to myself how twenty years of life could have stamped so sad and wistful an expression upon it.

_`` That is a curious old chest, is not it?''_<br/>Ah, that is a curious sight, is it not?'

_said Miss Tilney, as Catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass._<br/>`` The night air is chill, Mr. Upperton,'' said she, and so swept swiftly away, leaving me to muse over the strange words which had fallen from her lips.

_`` It is impossible to say how many generations it has been here._<br/>It is impossible for him to be anything else.

_How it came to be first put in this room I know not, but I have not had it moved, because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets._<br/>How he took it I can not say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it was then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he managed to abstract some of the devil's- foot root.

_The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open._<br/>That's the worst of it.

_In that corner, however, it is at least out of the way.''_<br/>But if this is true, then the case is at an end.

_Catherine had no leisure for speech, being at once blushing, tying her gown, and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch._<br/> I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the case and to lay the narrative before my readers.

_Miss Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together, in an alarm not wholly unfounded, for General Tilney was pacing the drawing-room, his watch in his hand, and having, on the very instant of their entering, pulled the bell with violence, ordered`` Dinner to be on table directly!''_<br/>But he, the honest seaman, so incapable of deceit or affectation that he could not suspect it in others, ran madly to the bell, shouting for the maid, the doctor, and the smelling-salts, with incoherent words of grief, and such passionate terms of emotion that my father thought it more discreet to twitch me by the sleeve as a signal that we should steal from the room.

_Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke, and sat pale and breathless, in a most humble mood, concerned for his children, and detesting old chests; and the general, recovering his politeness as he looked at her, spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend, who was absolutely out of breath from haste, when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world: but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself, till they were happily seated at the dinner-table, when the general's complacent smiles, and a good appetite of her own, restored her to peace._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_The dining-parlour was a noble room, suitable in its dimensions to a much larger drawing-room than the one in common use, and fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of Catherine, who saw little more than its spaciousness and the number of their attendants._<br/> Whilst in that comfortable lethargic condition which accompanies both digestion and poisoning by nicotine, I suddenly became aware of the extraordinary fact that my little drawing-room had elongated into a great _ salon _, and that my humble table had increased in proportion.

_Of the former, she spoke aloud her admiration; and the general, with a very gracious countenance, acknowledged that it was by no means an ill-sized room, and further confessed that, though as careless on such subjects as most people, he did look upon a tolerably large eating-room as one of the necessaries of life; he supposed, however,`` that she must have been used to much better-sized apartments at Mr. Allen's?''_<br/>The majority, however, looked upon him as a young man of great promise, and many comparisons were made as they left the hall between his dignified conduct and the levity of his professor, who during the above remarks was laughing heartily in a corner, by no means abashed at the failure of the experiment.

_`` No, indeed,'' was Catherine's honest assurance;`` Mr. Allen's dining-parlour was not more than half as large,'' and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life._<br/> She never went more than a few yards from the house, and indeed never put her foot over the threshold without looking carefully out of each window in order to be sure that there was nobody about.

_The general's good humour increased._<br/>My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously.

_Why, as he had such rooms, he thought it would be simple not to make use of them; but, upon his honour, he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half their size._<br/>Among other things, he found that the height of the building was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space between, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet.

_Mr. Allen's house, he was sure, must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness._<br/>For my own part, if I were only assured that I was as clever and brave as the average man about me, I should be well satisfied.

_The evening passed without any further disturbance, and, in the occasional absence of General Tilney, with much positive cheerfulness._<br/>`` Then I'll think no more of it,'' said I with as much cheerfulness as I could assume at so short a notice.

_It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey; and even then, even in moments of languor or restraint, a sense of general happiness preponderated, and she could think of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The night was stormy; the wind had been rising at intervals the whole afternoon; and by the time the party broke up, it blew and rained violently._<br/> It was March and the evenings were chill, so Jane had lit the fire, but the wind drove the smoke downwards and the air was full of its acrid taint.

_Catherine, as she crossed the hall, listened to the tempest with sensations of awe; and, when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door, felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey._<br/> This last address, delivered with a perfect shriek of rage, had the effect of sending good Madame von Baumgarten flying along the passage and through the kitchen, where she locked herself up in the scullery and went into violent hysterics.

_Yes, these were characteristic sounds; they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes, which such buildings had witnessed, and such storms ushered in; and most heartily did she rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn!_<br/>It was but two nights before the date I had fixed upon for my change of dwelling, when I was conscious of a bustle in the house beneath, with the bearing of heavy burdens up the creaking stair, and the harsh voice of my landlady, loud in welcome and protestations of joy.

_She had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken gallants._<br/>I had never ceased to be an earnest theist, because it seemed to me that Napoleon's question to the atheistic professors on the starry night as he voyaged to Egypt:`` Who was it, gentlemen, who made these stars?''

_Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning._<br/>She had not spoken more than three or four times with her nephew, and knew nothing more of him than he had told her on the evening before.

_In a house so furnished, and so guarded, she could have nothing to explore or to suffer, and might go to her bedroom as securely as if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton._<br/>I would have left the room without another word, but he clung to me, and tore the ruffle from my wrist in his attempt to hold me back, and to prevail upon me to promise to say nothing to you or Sir Lothian Hume.

_Thus wisely fortifying her mind, as she proceeded upstairs, she was enabled, especially on perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her, to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart; and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire._<br/>It chanced, however, that the unhappy sheep, which was quietly engaged in sleeping off the effects of its unusual potations, was awakened by the noise of his approach, and finding herself in such an unusual position, sprang out of bed and rushed furiously for the door, bleating wildly, and rolling about like a brig in a tornado, partly from intoxication and partly from the night-dress which impeded her movements.

_`` How much better is this,'' said she, as she walked to the fender--`` how much better to find a fire ready lit, than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed, as so many poor girls have been obliged to do, and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot!_<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_How glad I am that Northanger is what it is!_<br/>Oh, I am so glad.''

_If it had been like some other places, I do not know that, in such a night as this, I could have answered for my courage: but now, to be sure, there is nothing to alarm one.''_<br/>From that time I have never heard him allude to the matter, nor did he ever give us any reason why he should so confidently have expected the second coming upon that particular night.

_She looked round the room._<br/>`` Then let us go and look at the room.''

_The window curtains seemed in motion._<br/>There is the window.

_It could be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the divisions of the shutters; and she stepped boldly forward, carelessly humming a tune, to assure herself of its being so, peeped courageously behind each curtain, saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her, and on placing a hand against the shutter, felt the strongest conviction of the wind's force._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_A glance at the old chest, as she turned away from this examination, was not without its use; she scorned the causeless fears of an idle fancy, and began with a most happy indifference to prepare herself for bed._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` She should take her time; she should not hurry herself; she did not care if she were the last person up in the house._<br/>If I had not penetrated her secret I should often have thought that she forgot even that I was in the house.

_But she would not make up her fire; that would seem cowardly, as if she wished for the protection of light after she were in bed.''_<br/>`` She shall not be buried in that,'' he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone.

_The fire therefore died away, and Catherine, having spent the best part of an hour in her arrangements, was beginning to think of stepping into bed, when, on giving a parting glance round the room, she was struck by the appearance of a high, old-fashioned black cabinet, which, though in a situation conspicuous enough, had never caught her notice before._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Henry's words, his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first, immediately rushed across her; and though there could be nothing really in it, there was something whimsical, it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence!_<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_She took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet._<br/>She had opened her eyes, and was blinking at them in the lamplight.

_It was not absolutely ebony and gold; but it was japan, black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind; and as she held her candle, the yellow had very much the effect of gold._<br/>It would not be difficult for me to ride across country, and I was well horsed at that time, for I had not only Violette and Rataplan, who were two of the finest mounts in the army, but I had the splendid black English hunter which I had taken from Sir Cotton.

_The key was in the door, and she had a strange fancy to look into it; not, however, with the smallest expectation of finding anything, but it was so very odd, after what Henry had said._<br/>As I stood with my back to the narrow window, I had around me every smallest detail upon which my young eyes had looked; nor was I conscious that my own heart and feelings had undergone much change.

_In short, she could not sleep till she had examined it._<br/>`` I could not sleep,'' she answered.

_So, placing the candle with great caution on a chair, she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn it; but it resisted her utmost strength._<br/>On this she sprang out of her chair with a cry of great joy, and holding the garment which she was mending over her head, and swaying it from side to side with the motion of her body, she danced as lightly as a feather all round the room, and then out through the open door into the sunshine.

_Alarmed, but not discouraged, she tried it another way; a bolt flew, and she believed herself successful; but how strangely mysterious!_<br/>And yet she did not like this secrecy, this disinclination upon the part of one so frank and honest as Ida to tell her what was passing.

_The door was still immovable._<br/>The door was open.

_She paused a moment in breathless wonder._<br/>she cried, with pretty wonder.

_The wind roared down the chimney, the rain beat in torrents against the windows, and everything seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation._<br/>From afar, when the breeze came from the north, the dull, low roar of the great city might be heard, like the breaking of the tide of life, while along the horizon might be seen the dim curtain of smoke, the grim spray which that tide threw up.

_To retire to bed, however, unsatisfied on such a point, would be vain, since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate vicinity._<br/>From the moment we rose until we closed our eyes in sleep the thought was always with us, and we felt dishonoured that he, our chief and master, should be so humiliated without our being able to move a hand to help him.

_Again, therefore, she applied herself to the key, and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined celerity of hope's last effort, the door suddenly yielded to her hand: her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory, and having thrown open each folding door, the second being secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock, though in that her eye could not discern anything unusual, a double range of small drawers appeared in view, with some larger drawers above and below them; and in the centre, a small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured in all probability a cavity of importance._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_Catherine's heart beat quick, but her courage did not fail her._<br/> My fears told me that it might be my own very great discomfiture, but I did not say so.

_With a cheek flushed by hope, and an eye straining with curiosity, her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth._<br/> And she-- ah, if you could have seen the look she gave me, the flushed cheek, the moist eye, the tremulous lip!

_It was entirely empty._<br/>It was absolutely and completely empty.

_With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second, a third, a fourth; each was equally empty._<br/>There could not be the least doubt that it was this which the fellow had striven so frantically to conceal upon the first alarm of the approach of a stranger.

_Not one was left unsearched, and in not one was anything found._<br/>All was not yet lost.

_Well read in the art of concealing a treasure, the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her, and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain._<br/>I could not but observe, however, that her fall was very carefully executed, and that she was fortunate enough, in spite of her insensibility, to arrange her drapery and attitude into a graceful and classical design.

_The place in the middle alone remained now unexplored; and though she had`` never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the cabinet, and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus far, it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it.''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_It was some time however before she could unfasten the door, the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of the outer; but at length it did open; and not vain, as hitherto, was her search; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity, apparently for concealment, and her feelings at that moment were indescribable._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Her heart fluttered, her knees trembled, and her cheeks grew pale._<br/>Then she pursed up her lips and shook her stern, brown face in disapproval.

_She seized, with an unsteady hand, the precious manuscript, for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold, resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest._<br/>The curious convulsive wriggle of one of his arms, which always showed when he was excited, gradually died away, and after looking for some time at the papers of de Meneval-- who had written away like an automaton during all this uproar-- he came across to the fire with a smile upon his lips, and a brow from which the shadow had departed.

_The dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction; it had yet some hours to burn; and that she might not have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion, she hastily snuffed it._<br/> I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the case and to lay the narrative before my readers.

_Alas!_<br/>Alas!

_It was snuffed and extinguished in one._<br/>And then the light went out, smothered in that which had grown round it.

_A lamp could not have expired with more awful effect._<br/>It is not altogether a favourable case, but still it might be much worse.

_Catherine, for a few moments, was motionless with horror._<br/>said she, after a few minutes of embarrassed silence.

_It was done completely; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath._<br/>Since the spirit is by its very nature invisible, we can not see these comings and goings, but we see their effect in the body of the subject, now rigid and inert, now struggling to narrate impressions which could never have come to it by natural means.

_Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room._<br/>Cosmos is impenetrable.

_A violent gust of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the moment._<br/>A frightful cry-- a long-drawn scream of terror and of pain-- rang through it as we entered.

_Catherine trembled from head to foot._<br/>cried Mycroft, springing to his feet.

_In the pause which succeeded, a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear._<br/>I forced the end of this into the chink of the planks, and I was about to twist them outward when the sound of rapid footsteps caused me to pause and to listen.

_Human nature could support no more._<br/>I can say no more.

_A cold sweat stood on her forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand, and groping her way to the bed, she jumped hastily in, and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes._<br/>It chanced, however, that the unhappy sheep, which was quietly engaged in sleeping off the effects of its unusual potations, was awakened by the noise of his approach, and finding herself in such an unusual position, sprang out of bed and rushed furiously for the door, bleating wildly, and rolling about like a brig in a tornado, partly from intoxication and partly from the night-dress which impeded her movements.

_To close her eyes in sleep that night, she felt must be entirely out of the question._<br/>But the long night had to be passed somehow, and for me at least, sleep seemed to be out of the question.

_With a curiosity so justly awakened, and feelings in every way so agitated, repose must be absolutely impossible._<br/>I am so sorry to cause you any disappointment, and I appreciate most highly the honour which you do me, but what you ask is quite impossible.''

_The storm too abroad so dreadful!_<br/>`` But, anyhow, universal death is dreadful.''

_She had not been used to feel alarm from wind, but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence._<br/>It was not a single cry, such as the hounds had uttered when they were on the scent, but a continuous deep-mouthed uproar, so fierce and so prolonged, that we could not doubt that they had come to the end of their run.

_The manuscript so wonderfully found, so wonderfully accomplishing the morning's prediction, how was it to be accounted for?_<br/>However, as I cast my mind back over the events of the morning, and as I reconsider the fatuous conduct of my companions, I find it easy to believe that some poison of an exciting kind was responsible for their symptoms.''

_What could it contain?_<br/>What can it mean?

_To whom could it relate?_<br/>How could you possibly know?

_By what means could it have been so long concealed?_<br/>But where can it have gone?

_And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it!_<br/>They have a strange effect upon me, and I begin to Ossianise.

_Till she had made herself mistress of its contents, however, she could have neither repose nor comfort; and with the sun's first rays she was determined to peruse it._<br/>The lady came, not altogether with the approval of her husband, and though she never gave indications of any very great psychic force, we were able, at least, to obtain those usual phenomena of message-tilting which are at the same time so puerile and so inexplicable.

_But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene._<br/>There was much to be done in very little time, so much that many would have thought it hopeless to attempt it.

_She shuddered, tossed about in her bed, and envied every quiet sleeper._<br/>She groaned aloud, and buried herself yet deeper amid the silken cushions, clutching them frantically with convulsed and twitching hands.

_The storm still raged, and various were the noises, more terrific even than the wind, which struck at intervals on her startled ear._<br/>My ears were so accustomed to the noises of nature, the sighing of the breeze and the sob of the waves, that any other sound made itself heard at a great distance.

_The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at another the lock of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to enter._<br/>Thus, when my wife came downstairs and I was impelled to slip behind the door and alarm her by some wild cry as she entered, I was able to stifle the impulse and to greet her with dignity and restraint.

_Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans._<br/>Then from out of the silence, imminent and threatening, there came once more that low, throaty croaking, far louder and closer than before.

_Hour after hour passed away, and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep._<br/>It chanced, however, that the unhappy sheep, which was quietly engaged in sleeping off the effects of its unusual potations, was awakened by the noise of his approach, and finding herself in such an unusual position, sprang out of bed and rushed furiously for the door, bleating wildly, and rolling about like a brig in a tornado, partly from intoxication and partly from the night-dress which impeded her movements.

_CHAPTER 22  The housemaid's folding back her window-shutters at eight o'clock the next day was the sound which first roused Catherine; and she opened her eyes, wondering that they could ever have been closed, on objects of cheerfulness; her fire was already burning, and a bright morning had succeeded the tempest of the night._<br/> Then when morning brought reflection, He was shamed at his dejection, And he thought with consternation Of his poor, ill-used creation; Down he rushed, and found it there Lying all exposed and bare,-LSB- 18-RSB- Mud-bespattered, spoiled, and botched, Water sodden, fungus-blotched, All the outlines blurred and wavy, All the colours turned to gravy, Fluids of a dappled hue, Blues on red and reds on blue, A pea-green mother with her daughter, Crazy boats on crazy water Steering out to who knows what, An island or a lobster-pot?

_Instantaneously, with the consciousness of existence, returned her recollection of the manuscript; and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid's going away, she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the roll on its falling to the ground, and flew back to enjoy the luxury of their perusal on her pillow._<br/>There was something in the gentleness of his rebuke, and in his appeal to her mother, which brought the tears to her eyes, and in another instant she would have been kneeling beside him with everything confessed, when the door flew open and her sister Ida came bounding into the room.

_She now plainly saw that she must not expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had shuddered over in books, for the roll, seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheets, was altogether but of trifling size, and much less than she had supposed it to be at first._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page._<br/> She gave him a swift, penetrating glance.

_She started at its import._<br/>I started as I looked at the picture.

_Could it be possible, or did not her senses play her false?_<br/>Would it not be a cruel thing to leave them in their distress?

_An inventory of linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that was before her!_<br/>It was modern in appearance, and yet it was far less so than its neighbours, all of which were crudely and painfully new.

_If the evidence of sight might be trusted, she held a washing-bill in her hand._<br/>`` If your friend,'' she said,`` would be good enough to stop, he might be of inestimable service to me.''

_She seized another sheet, and saw the same articles with little variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth presented nothing new._<br/>When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one.

_Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced her in each._<br/>He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs.

_Two others, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely more interesting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball._<br/>A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other.

_And the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest, seemed by its first cramp line,`` To poultice chestnut mare''-- a farrier's bill!_<br/>I remember that at Leipsic, when I was serving my first campaign, I got a candlestick, which I was forced to sell to a Jew broker for a fourth of its value; yet even at his price it sufficed to fill my haversack with broad pieces.'

_Such was the collection of papers-LRB- left perhaps, as she could then suppose, by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them-RRB- which had filled her with expectation and alarm, and robbed her of half her night's rest!_<br/>Mrs. Cooper was of opinion that if I were to call it might alarm him, so it was agreed between us that she should send him up in the evening on some pretext to my consulting-room, which would give me the opportunity of having a chat with him and, if I were convinced of his insanity, of signing his certificate.

_She felt humbled to the dust._<br/>She seemed surprised at my agitation.

_Could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom?_<br/>Why not add one good one to your account, by risking your life for the reformed faith?'

_A corner of it, catching her eye as she lay, seemed to rise up in judgment against her._<br/>Suddenly, with a sharp, quick gesture which had in it something of _ abandon _ and recklessness, she held out her hand to her companion.

_Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies._<br/>Nothing less than a miracle could preserve us from defeat, and most of us were of opinion that the days of the miracles were past.

_To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that, so modern, so habitable!_<br/>We can well believe that the most frivolous and foolish would be awed into decency by so tremendous an experience, but impressions soon become blunted, the old nature may soon reassert itself in new surroundings, and the frivolous still survive, as our seance rooms can testify.

_-- Or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet, the key of which was open to all!_<br/>My energies shall now be devoted to devising some means by which spirits may be able to recollect what occurs to them in their free state, and I trust that when I have worked this out, I may have the pleasure of meeting you all once again in this hall, and demonstrating to you the result.''

_How could she have so imposed on herself?_<br/>`` How could you leave me so, Jinny?

_Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know her folly!_<br/>By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us!''

_And it was in a great measure his own doing, for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures, she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it._<br/>Her mouth, too, was small and amiable, and her most frequent expression was a smile, which seldom broadened into a laugh, as she had her own reasons for preferring that her teeth should not be seen.

_This was the only comfort that occurred._<br/>It was his only fault.

_Impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly, those detestable papers then scattered over the bed, she rose directly, and folding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before, returned them to the same spot within the cabinet, with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again, to disgrace her even with herself._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_Why the locks should have been so difficult to open, however, was still something remarkable, for she could now manage them with perfect ease._<br/>'' Tis best so,' said I;` you could not have settled down to a life of toping and ease.

_In this there was surely something mysterious, and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute, till the possibility of the door's having been at first unlocked, and of being herself its fastener, darted into her head, and cost her another blush._<br/>The novelty of her presence had brought a few curious invalids into her consulting-rooms, and, once there, they had been so impressed by the firmness of her manner and by the singular, new-fashioned instruments with which she tapped, and peered, and sounded, that it formed the core of their conversation for weeks afterwards.

_She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections, and found her way with all speed to the breakfast-parlour, as it had been pointed out to her by Miss Tilney the evening before._<br/> In that instant there flashed before Theodora's mind a vision of all her enemies, of all those who envied her rise, of all whose hatred and contempt would rise into a clamour of delight could they see the daughter of the bearward hurled down again into that abyss from which she had been dragged.

_Henry was alone in it; and his immediate hope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest, with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited, was rather distressing._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_For the world would she not have her weakness suspected, and yet, unequal to an absolute falsehood, was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little._<br/>This could not be seen by me, even had I been fully awake, in the dusk; but catching me across the breast as Covenant trotted under it, it had swept me off and dashed me with great force to the ground.

_`` But we have a charming morning after it,'' she added, desiring to get rid of the subject;`` and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over._<br/>For the mariners, giving up all hope of saving the ship, and being in momentary expectation that she would founder, pushed off in the long-boat, whereby I fear that they met the fate which they hoped to avoid, since I have never from that day heard anything of them.

_What beautiful hyacinths!_<br/>beautiful!

_I have just learnt to love a hyacinth.''_<br/>I wish we could crown ourselves with flowers.

_`` And how might you learn?_<br/>`` But how could I tell?''

_By accident or argument?''_<br/>Had it been an accident?

_`` Your sister taught me; I can not tell how._<br/>`` You must not think of leaving your aunt,'' she said.

_Mrs. Allen used to take pains, year after year, to make me like them; but I never could, till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street; I am naturally indifferent about flowers.''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` But now you love a hyacinth._<br/>`` If you like, my darling.

_So much the better._<br/>`` You will feel so much better.''

_You have gained a new source of enjoyment, and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible._<br/>You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.

_Besides, a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex, as a means of getting you out of doors, and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take._<br/>While doing so, I shall make it my business, with infinite tact and delicacy, to throw out a few remarks which may arouse the interest of the audience and cause some of them to desire to go more deeply into the matter.

_And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic, who can tell, the sentiment once raised, but you may in time come to love a rose?''_<br/> Thus the account we give may be partial, but still such as it is it is very consistent and of extraordinary interest, since it refers to our own destiny and that of those we love.

_`` But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors._<br/>`` Surely you do not attribute any such base motive to me!''

_The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me, and in fine weather I am out more than half my time._<br/>It was a fine, clear spring night, the moon was shining out of an unclouded sky, and I, having already left many miles behind me, was inclined to walk slowly and look about me.

_Mamma says I am never within.''_<br/>`` I have never been so questioned,'' he cried.

_`` At any rate, however, I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth._<br/>`` I am glad to come if I can do any good by coming.''

_The mere habit of learning to love is the thing; and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing._<br/>The less experienced a doctor is, the higher are his notions of professional dignity, as I need not remind you, my young friend, so I was about to refuse the commission with indignation, when I bethought me that, quite apart from medicine, we were gentleman and lady, and that she had asked me to do something for her which was evidently of the greatest possible importance in her eyes.

_Has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction?''_<br/>My thanks once more, and may pleasant dreams await ye.'

_Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the general, whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind, but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine's notice when they were seated at table; and, lucidly, it had been the general's choice._<br/> I had seated myself, sick and dazed, upon the settee, for scenes of bloodshed were new to me then, and this one had been enough to shock the most hardened.

_He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste, confessed it to be neat and simple, thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country; and for his part, to his uncritical palate, the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire, as from that of Dresden or Save._<br/>For you may remember, my children, that I stated when I first took it in hand to narrate to you these passages of my life, that the hopes of Monmouth's party rested very much upon the raid which Argyle and the Scottish exiles had made upon Ayrshire, where it was hoped that they would create such a disturbance as would divert a good share of King James's forces, and so make our march to London less difficult.

_But this was quite an old set, purchased two years ago._<br/>That was six years ago.

_The manufacture was much improved since that time; he had seen some beautiful specimens when last in town, and had he not been perfectly without vanity of that kind, might have been tempted to order a new set._<br/>For some time I was sustained in my scepticism by the consideration that many famous men, such as Darwin himself, Huxley, Tyndall and Herbert Spencer, derided this new branch of knowledge; but when I learned that their derision had reached such a point that they would not even examine it, and that Spencer had declared in so many words that he had decided against it on a priori grounds, while Huxley had said that it did not interest him, I was bound to admit that, however great, they were in science, their action in this respect was most unscientific and dogmatic, while the action of those who studied the phenomena and tried to find out the laws that governed them, was following the true path which has given us all human advance and knowledge.

_He trusted, however, that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one-- though not for himself._<br/>I will promise, however, that your request be carried to him, though I warn you that it can not be granted.'

_Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him._<br/>It was not the first time, my friends, as you are well aware, and you know the reasons that I had to trust that neither nerve nor judgment would ever fail me.

_Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston, where business required and would keep him two or three days._<br/>`` Once a week Harrison used to bring me up provisions, passing them through the pantry window, which I left open for the purpose.

_They all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse, and immediately on re-entering the breakfast-room, Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure._<br/> The abbot, who had made several visits to Constantinople upon the business of his monastery, walked with the assured step of one who knows his ground; while the boy, alarmed and yet pleased by the rush of people, the roar and clatter of passing chariots, and the vista of magnificent buildings, held tightly to the loose gown of his guide, while staring eagerly about him in every direction.

_`` This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother's fortitude,'' observed the general to Eleanor._<br/>It is as well, for I have already made up my mind that my duty to you, my son, outweighs that which I owe, and have at such bitter cost fulfilled, to my brother and my family.''

_`` Woodston will make but a sombre appearance today.''_<br/>`` Tree-cutting and wood-carrying will seem but dull work after such a sight as this.''

_`` Is it a pretty place?''_<br/>`` How is it now?''

_asked Catherine._<br/>asked Ida.

_`` What say you, Eleanor?_<br/>`` What do you say, Norah?''

_Speak your opinion, for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men._<br/>It's for men to do them, and for women to reserve their love as a reward for such men.

_I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations._<br/>`` I think he will be the most useful at this task.

_The house stands among fine meadows facing the south-east, with an excellent kitchen-garden in the same aspect; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago, for the benefit of my son._<br/>The farm was a very fertile one, and contained some of the best grazing land in those parts, so that my father was enabled to lay by money to the extent of a thousand crowns, which he laid out in an adventure to the Indies with such surprising success that in less than three years it had increased fourfold.

_It is a family living, Miss Morland; and the property in the place being chiefly my own, you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one._<br/>Again, if Miss Julia Ames can tell Mr. Stead things in her own earth life of which he could not have cognisance, and if those things are shown, when tested, to be true, then one is more inclined to think that those things which can not be tested are true also.

_Did Henry's income depend solely on this living, he would not be ill-provided for._<br/>` Were I to be the judge, he would lose not only his merchandise, but his life also, if he did not accept the faith.'

_Perhaps it may seem odd, that with only two younger children, I should think any profession necessary for him; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business._<br/>But now when I am faced with the alternative of telling the facts about my brother, or of wronging my son, I can only act in one fashion, and the more so since I have reason to hope that a way may be found by which what I am now about to disclose to you need never come to the public ear.''

_But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies, I am sure your father, Miss Morland, would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment._<br/>All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,-- for you have not done me a very good turn,-- but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.''

_The money is nothing, it is not an object, but employment is the thing._<br/>There was nothing in it which was not literally true.

_Even Frederick, my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county, has his profession.''_<br/>But if you would come out with me into that forgotten world; if you would know Boy Jim and Champion Harrison; if you would meet my father, one of Nelson's own men; if you would catch a glimpse of that great seaman himself, and of George, afterwards the unworthy King of England; if, above all, you would see my famous uncle, Sir Charles Tregellis, the King of the Bucks, and the great fighting men whose names are still household words amongst you, then give me your hand and let us start.

_The imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes._<br/> If I had to die I was determined that my end should be worthy of my life.

_The silence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable._<br/>Then the mystery of his silence was explained.

_Something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the house, and he now offered himself as her conductor; and though Catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter, it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself, under any circumstances, not to be gladly accepted; for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey, and had seen only a few of its rooms._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_The netting-box, just leisurely drawn forth, was closed with joyful haste, and she was ready to attend him in a moment._<br/>At last, however, his long-drawn breathing assured me that he was asleep, and I was able to settle down to a few hours of welcome rest.

_`` And when they had gone over the house, he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden.''_<br/>`` I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.

_She curtsied her acquiescence._<br/>she murmured.

_`` But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object._<br/>I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed.

_The weather was at present favourable, and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so._<br/>The event itself will always be marvellous, but the circumstances that we four were together at the time of this extraordinary episode came about in a most natural and, indeed, inevitable fashion.

_Which would she prefer?_<br/>What could she do?

_He was equally at her service._<br/>Professionally, he was always at their service.

_Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend's wishes?_<br/>And I should be obliged to you if you would use your influence with my daughter to dissuade her.''

_But he thought he could discern._<br/>But he may ask.

_Yes, he certainly read in Miss Morland's eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather._<br/>How I wish I could reproduce the glamour of his discourses, the peculiar mixture of accurate knowledge and of racy imagination which gave them their fascination, until even the Professor's cynical and sceptical smile would gradually vanish from his thin face as he listened.

_But when did she judge amiss?_<br/>` But why did you not tell me so?'

_The abbey would be always safe and dry._<br/>The fort is safe enough.

_He yielded implicitly, and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment.''_<br/>He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded.

_He left the room, and Catherine, with a disappointed, anxious face, began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination, under a mistaken idea of pleasing her; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney's saying, with a little confusion,`` I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine; and do not be uneasy on my father's account; he always walks out at this time of day.''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood._<br/>` Because I did not wish you to come here.'

_Why was Miss Tilney embarrassed?_<br/>cried Miss Adams, indignantly.

_Could there be any unwillingness on the general's side to show her over the abbey?_<br/>But if by whisper or rumour I have reason to think that you have failed me, then you and your monks and your monastery will have such an end as will be a lesson for ever to those who would break faith with their Empress.''

_The proposal was his own._<br/>The present was our own.

_And was not it odd that he should always take his walk so early?_<br/>I do not know if it is still standing, but I should think it likely, for it was not a place much given to change.

_Neither her father nor Mr. Allen did so._<br/>`` Neither my mother nor I could imagine.

_It was certainly very provoking._<br/>It was enough.

_She was all impatience to see the house, and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds._<br/>As already remarked, she had a great antipathy to him, and if ever he ventured into the house it was on sufferance, and under the protection of the Professor.

_If Henry had been with them indeed!_<br/>If he had his time again!

_But now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it._<br/>But she must not think of herself.

_Such were her thoughts, but she kept them to herself, and put on her bonnet in patient discontent._<br/>She still held her handkerchief before her eyes, but it was chiefly, I think, to conceal the effect which her tears had had upon her cheeks.

_She was struck, however, beyond her expectation, by the grandeur of the abbey, as she saw it for the first time from the lawn._<br/>`` I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.

_The whole building enclosed a large court; and two sides of the quadrangle, rich in Gothic ornaments, stood forward for admiration._<br/>It stood high, and commanded a view on the one side of the grey roofs and bristling spires of Northern London, and on the other of the well-wooded and beautiful country which fringes the great city.

_The remainder was shut off by knolls of old trees, or luxuriant plantations, and the steep woody hills rising behind, to give it shelter, were beautiful even in the leafless month of March._<br/>So out we went together into the sweet coast-land air, the sweeter for the gale of the night before, and we walked through the old yew-lined paths, and out into the park, and so round the castle, looking up at the gables, the grey pinnacles, the oak-mullioned windows, the ancient wing with its crenulated walls and its meurtriere windows, the modern with its pleasant verandah and veil of honeysuckle.

_Catherine had seen nothing to compare with it; and her feelings of delight were so strong, that without waiting for any better authority, she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise._<br/>No one could entertain more charmingly than she, for she moved about among the people with her amiable smile, setting everybody at their ease by her kindly natural manner, and by the conviction which she gave them that she was thoroughly at her ease herself.

_The general listened with assenting gratitude; and it seemed as if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour._<br/>De Meneval has told me that for an hour at a time he has sometimes talked in this strain of the most intimate thoughts and aspirations of his heart, while his courtiers have stood round in silence waiting for the instant when he would return once more to his practical and incisive self.

_The kitchen-garden was to be next admired, and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park._<br/> Out of my window as I write I can see my own great lad in the garden, and if I were to call out`` Nelson!''

_The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay, being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen's, as well her father's, including church-yard and orchard._<br/> It did not surprise me, therefore, that we should find the large room in which we supped crowded with naval men, but I remember that what did cause me some astonishment was to observe that all these sailors, who had served under the most varying conditions in all quarters of the globe, from the Baltic to the East Indies, should have been moulded into so uniform a type that they were more like each other than brother is commonly to brother.

_The walls seemed countless in number, endless in length; a village of hot-houses seemed to arise among them, and a whole parish to be at work within the enclosure._<br/> At four o'clock Monmouth held a last council of war upon the square tower out of which springs the steeple of Bridgewater parish church, whence a good view can be obtained of all the country round.

_The general was flattered by her looks of surprise, which told him almost as plainly, as he soon forced her to tell him in words, that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before; and he then modestly owned that,`` without any ambition of that sort himself-- without any solicitude about it-- he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom._<br/>They were never at their ease, always upon the brink of a catastrophe, encouraged one day only to be rudely rebuffed the next, bullied in public and slighted in private, and yet, in spite of it all, the singular fact remains that they loved him and served him as no monarch has been loved and served.

_If he had a hobby-horse, it was that._<br/>If he had his time again!

_He loved a garden._<br/>You also loved her.

_Though careless enough in most matters of eating, he loved good fruit-- or if he did not, his friends and children did._<br/>But I had not got half through my story, and Jim, like the good fellow that he was, had just begun to forget his own troubles in his delight at my good fortune, when my uncle called to me from without.

_There were great vexations, however, attending such a garden as his._<br/>So absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over the watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the garden path.

_The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits._<br/>I do not know you sufficiently to be able to say what natural gifts you have.''

_The pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year._<br/>In point of fact he had just turned his thirtieth year.

_Mr. Allen, he supposed, must feel these inconveniences as well as himself.''_<br/>`` Now, Mr. Malone,'' he continued, with a great accession of dignity,`` this way, if YOU please.''

_`` No, not at all._<br/>`` No, no, not at all.

_Mr. Allen did not care about the garden, and never went into it.''_<br/>I do not know why they should be so coupled, and they never were with Jim.

_With a triumphant smile of self-satisfaction, the general wished he could do the same, for he never entered his, without being vexed in some way or other, by its falling short of his plan._<br/> And at the words that little conventional spirit which had never known until that night the capacity for fierce agony which lay within it, learned for the second time that there were springs of joy also which it had never tapped before.

_`` How were Mr. Allen's succession-houses worked?''_<br/>`` Make what, Mr. Stephens?''

_describing the nature of his own as they entered them._<br/>As to myself, I shall let my story explain the growth of my own nature.

_`` Mr. Allen had only one small hot-house, which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter, and there was a fire in it now and then.''_<br/>  DECEMBER'S SNOW-LSB- 99-RSB-  The bloom is on the May once more, The chestnut buds have burst anew; But, darling, all our springs are o'er,'T is winter still for me and you.

_`` He is a happy man!''_<br/>`` And a good man too!''

_said the general, with a look of very happy contempt._<br/>I felt light and happy, in spite of all.

_Having taken her into every division, and led her under every wall, till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering, he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door, and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea-house, proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk, if Miss Morland were not tired._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_`` But where are you going, Eleanor?_<br/>And what will you do, Sadie?''

_Why do you choose that cold, damp path to it?_<br/>Yes, yes, I insist upon it, for I know that you must be cold.

_Miss Morland will get wet._<br/>It is very wet.

_Our best way is across the park.''_<br/>said I.`` The one that stands in its own park?''

_`` This is so favourite a walk of mine,'' said Miss Tilney,`` that I always think it the best and nearest way._<br/>`` You know, pa,'' said Ida,`` it seems to us that we really have a very great advantage in having Mrs. Westmacott living so near.''

_But perhaps it may be damp.''_<br/>Or perhaps it may not be so.

_It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs; and Catherine, struck by its gloomy aspect, and eager to enter it, could not, even by the general's disapprobation, be kept from stepping forward._<br/> Taking the narrow sheep path which ran by this stream, I strolled along it for some hundred yards, and had turned to retrace my steps, when the moon was finally buried beneath an ink-black cloud, and the darkness deepened so suddenly that I could see neither the path at my feet, the stream upon my right, nor the rocks upon my left.

_He perceived her inclination, and having again urged the plea of health in vain, was too polite to make further opposition._<br/>For myself, I confess that I retained a vague distrust of the man, and was determined to avoid putting faith in him more than was needful.

_He excused himself, however, from attending them:`` The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him, and he would meet them by another course.''_<br/>From his wife to his groom there was not one of those who were about him who did not live in dread of being held up to ridicule and infamy before a smiling crowd, whose amusement was only tempered by the reflection that each of them might be the next to endure the same exposure.

_He turned away; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation._<br/>He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.

_The shock, however, being less real than the relief, offered it no injury; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired._<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_`` I am particularly fond of this spot,'' said her companion, with a sigh._<br/>`` With fond and loving words I overcame her doubts, and yet she hesitated.

_`` It was my mother's favourite walk.''_<br/>And then there were my mother and my sisters to be thought of.

_Catherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before, and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance, and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more._<br/>-LSB- Illustration: Certain that I would not leave you here p152-RSB-  It was the nearest approach to tenderness which he had ever put into a speech, and the girl looked at him in surprise.

_`` I used to walk here so often with her!''_<br/>`` I tell you that I saw her do it.

_added Eleanor;`` though I never loved it then, as I have loved it since._<br/>I love you, and I have never ceased to love you, though you had forgotten me.''

_At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice._<br/>`` At the end of that time she shall give her answer.''

_But her memory endears it now.''_<br/>But she-- she was admirable.

_`` And ought it not,'' reflected Catherine,`` to endear it to her husband?_<br/>`` Why should he not take your mother with him?''

_Yet the general would not enter it.''_<br/>But it would not do!

_Miss Tilney continuing silent, she ventured to say,`` Her death must have been a great affliction!''_<br/>Her voice was full of tears, and what she said was so simple, so true, that we both seemed to see the dead babe stretched there on the carpet before us, and we could have joined in with words of pity and of grief.

_`` A great and increasing one,'' replied the other, in a low voice._<br/>` And so have I, mate,' he answered, in a softer voice.

_`` I was only thirteen when it happened; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it, I did not, I could not, then know what a loss it was.''_<br/>`` S'pose he were only twenty, then he could n't be less than six-and-eighty now, at the lowest.''

_She stopped for a moment, and then added, with great firmness,`` I have no sister, you know-- and though Henry-- though my brothers are very affectionate, and Henry is a great deal here, which I am most thankful for, it is impossible for me not to be often solitary.''_<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_`` To be sure you must miss him very much.''_<br/>`` I like him very much indeed.

_`` A mother would have been always present._<br/>' I should have been there!'

_A mother would have been a constant friend; her influence would have been beyond all other.''_<br/>All which has been discovered to us by the mother and daughter, and by neighbours that know her.

_`` Was she a very charming woman?_<br/>`` What a very attractive woman!''

_Was she handsome?_<br/>And yet she was very handsome.

_Was there any picture of her in the abbey?_<br/>` Are there any papers in the cottage?'

_And why had she been so partial to that grove?_<br/>`` But you must have known the nature of your complaint, why otherwise should you have come to me?''

_Was it from dejection of spirits?''_<br/>Was Etienne Gerard in despair?

_-- were questions now eagerly poured forth; the first three received a ready affirmative, the two others were passed by; and Catherine's interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with every question, whether answered or not._<br/>How spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by Miss Julia Ames, who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication, but admitted, after fifteen years, that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over.

_Of her unhappiness in marriage, she felt persuaded._<br/>The awful thought had come upon her that this ambassadress had come to her as a proxy with a proposal of marriage.

_The general certainly had been an unkind husband._<br/>It had been an epoch of weak and cruel men.

_He did not love her walk: could he therefore have loved her?_<br/>Do you not think that she may come to forget this man and to love me?''

_And besides, handsome as he was, there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her._<br/>If love had not come to her yet, there was at least pity and sympathy, which are nearly akin to it.

_`` Her picture, I suppose,'' blushing at the consummate art of her own question,`` hangs in your father's room?''_<br/>`` Well, your dad can teach you something in history yet,'' he cried, looking in triumph at my mother.

_`` No; it was intended for the drawing-room; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting, and for some time it had no place._<br/> I could have explained that it was because he had betrayed his comrades, because his daughter hated him, because he had ill-used his wife, because my father regarded him as the source of all his troubles-- but the salon of the Empress was no place for a family quarrel, so I merely shrugged my shoulders, and was silent.

_Soon after her death I obtained it for my own, and hung it in my bed-chamber-- where I shall be happy to show it you; it is very like.''_<br/>I hope, madam, by the King's generosity and goodness, and your intercession, I may hope for my life which if I have shall be ever employed in showing to your Majesty all the sense immaginable of gratitude, and in serving of the King like a true subject.

_Here was another proof._<br/>Here it is.

_A portrait-- very like-- of a departed wife, not valued by the husband!_<br/>`` I was sure that you were not a man who, to clear yourself from a little money difficulty, would sacrifice the happiness of your mother and the health of your father.''

_He must have been dreadfully cruel to her!_<br/>I have been very selfish and thoughtless.''

_Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which, in spite of all his attentions, he had previously excited; and what had been terror and dislike before, was now absolute aversion._<br/> There was nothing which the Emperor loved more than to suddenly produce little scenes of this sort which made everybody very uncomfortable, for no one could tell what awkward or compromising question he was going to put to them next.

_Yes, aversion!_<br/>Oh, lack-a-day, lack-a-day!

_His cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her._<br/>It's disgusting to see that brute with her.

_She had often read of such characters, characters which Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn; but here was proof positive of the contrary._<br/>I have seen him look pained, it is true, after some peculiarly outrageous exhibition, but he gave me the impression that it was always on account of the scholars or of me, never on account of himself.

_She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the general; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation, she found herself again obliged to walk with him, listen to him, and even to smile when he smiled._<br/> I thought of the solicitude which he had shown over my toilet in the morning, his anxiety that I should make a favourable impression, his displeasure when she had been cold to me, and the smile upon his face when he had seen us hand in hand.

_Being no longer able, however, to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects, she soon began to walk with lassitude; the general perceived it, and with a concern for her health, which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him, was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_He would follow them in a quarter of an hour._<br/>It will be ready in half an hour.

_Again they parted-- but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return._<br/>Thus, pacing slowly, we returned to Bridgewater, where Reuben was carried to our quarters, and I bore the little maid of the marshes to kind townsfolk, who promised to restore her to her home when the troubles were over.

_This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable._<br/>What was the meaning of this obscure warning which she had given me against her father, and why was she so frankly anxious to know about my love affairs?

_CHAPTER 23  An hour passed away before the general came in, spent, on the part of his young guest, in no very favourable consideration of his character._<br/> But it was no easy thing for me to think seriously of anything in the hamlet; for I was in some way, my dear children, though I say it myself, a favourite with the young and with the old, so that I could not walk ten paces without some greeting or address.

_`` This lengthened absence, these solitary rambles, did not speak a mind at ease, or a conscience void of reproach.''_<br/>Since the spirit is by its very nature invisible, we can not see these comings and goings, but we see their effect in the body of the subject, now rigid and inert, now struggling to narrate impressions which could never have come to it by natural means.

_At length he appeared; and, whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations, he could still smile with them._<br/> He nodded his head, and even in the gloom I could see that he was smiling the gentle, wistful smile which I connected with him.

_Miss Tilney, understanding in part her friend's curiosity to see the house, soon revived the subject; and her father being, contrary to Catherine's expectations, unprovided with any pretence for further delay, beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return, was at last ready to escort them._<br/>He was married to the second daughter of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir Lothian's descendants have their eye upon the property, they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them.

_They set forward; and, with a grandeur of air, a dignified step, which caught the eye, but could not shake the doubts of the well-read Catherine, he led the way across the hall, through the common drawing-room and one useless antechamber, into a room magnificent both in size and furniture-- the real drawing-room, used only with company of consequence._<br/> John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.

_It was very noble-- very grand-- very charming!_<br/>`` It is splendid!''

_-- was all that Catherine had to say, for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin; and all minuteness of praise, all praise that had much meaning, was supplied by the general: the costliness or elegance of any room's fitting-up could be nothing to her; she cared for no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_When the general had satisfied his own curiosity, in a close examination of every well-known ornament, they proceeded into the library, an apartment, in its way, of equal magnificence, exhibiting a collection of books, on which an humble man might have looked with pride._<br/>With this small stock of letters I might have fared badly, had it not happened that my master, Mr. Thomas Chillingfoot, had himself a good library, and took a pleasure in lending his books to any of his scholars who showed a desire to improve themselves.

_Catherine heard, admired, and wondered with more genuine feeling than before-- gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge, by running over the titles of half a shelf, and was ready to proceed._<br/>Her voice was soft and sweet, and persuasive at the first, but louder it rang and louder as it spoke of wrongs and freedom and the joys of death in a good cause, until it thrilled into my every nerve, and I asked nothing more than to run out of the cottage and to die then and there in the cause of my country.

_But suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes._<br/>I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.''

_Large as was the building, she had already visited the greatest part; though, on being told that, with the addition of the kitchen, the six or seven rooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court, she could scarcely believe it, or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted._<br/>For the last few days prisoners had been tried in batches of ten and twenty, but now the whole of us were taken in a drove, under escort, to the court-house, where as many as could be squeezed in were ranged in the dock, while the rest were penned, like calves in the market, in the body of the hall.

_It was some relief, however, that they were to return to the rooms in common use, by passing through a few of less importance, looking into the court, which, with occasional passages, not wholly unintricate, connected the different sides; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister, having traces of cells pointed out, and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her-- by finding herself successively in a billiard-room, and in the general's private apartment, without comprehending their connection, or being able to turn aright when she left them; and lastly, by passing through a dark little room, owning Henry's authority, and strewed with his litter of books, guns, and greatcoats._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_From the dining-room, of which, though already seen, and always to be seen at five o'clock, the general could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length, for the more certain information of Miss Morland, as to what she neither doubted nor cared for, they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen-- the ancient kitchen of the convent, rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days, and in the stoves and hot closets of the present._<br/>  CHAPTER VII `` To-morrow we Disappear into the Unknown''  I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner, nor will I tell of our week's stay at Para-LRB- save that I should wish to acknowledge the great kindness of the Pereira da Pinta Company in helping us to get together our equipment-RRB-.

_The general's improving hand had not loitered here: every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been adopted within this, their spacious theatre; and, when the genius of others had failed, his own had often produced the perfection wanted._<br/>For some time I was sustained in my scepticism by the consideration that many famous men, such as Darwin himself, Huxley, Tyndall and Herbert Spencer, derided this new branch of knowledge; but when I learned that their derision had reached such a point that they would not even examine it, and that Spencer had declared in so many words that he had decided against it on a priori grounds, while Huxley had said that it did not interest him, I was bound to admit that, however great, they were in science, their action in this respect was most unscientific and dogmatic, while the action of those who studied the phenomena and tried to find out the laws that governed them, was following the true path which has given us all human advance and knowledge.

_His endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactors of the convent._<br/>Some say that she loved another man, and that it was just the riches of the old Lord which tempted her to be false to her lover, and that now she is eating her heart out because she has lost the one without being any nearer to the other, for she might be the poorest woman in the parish for all the money that she has the handling of.''

_With the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey; the fourth side of the quadrangle having, on account of its decaying state, been removed by the general's father, and the present erected in its place._<br/> Straightway my uncle began to question him about the sea service, and for the whole meal my father was telling him of the Nile and of the Toulon blockade, and the siege of Genoa, and all that he had seen and done.

_All that was venerable ceased here._<br/>All this may in time be forgotten.

_The new building was not only new, but declared itself to be so; intended only for offices, and enclosed behind by stable-yards, no uniformity of architecture had been thought necessary._<br/>Finding conditions entirely different from anything for which either scientific or religious teaching had prepared them, it is no wonder that they look upon their new sensations as some strange dream, and the more rigidly orthodox have been their views, the more impossible do they find it to accept these new surroundings with all that they imply.

_Catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest, for the purposes of mere domestic economy; and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen, had the general allowed it; but if he had a vanity, it was in the arrangement of his offices; and as he was convinced that, to a mind like Miss Morland's, a view of the accommodations and comforts, by which the labours of her inferiors were softened, must always be gratifying, he should make no apology for leading her on._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_They took a slight survey of all; and Catherine was impressed, beyond her expectation, by their multiplicity and their convenience._<br/>No one could entertain more charmingly than she, for she moved about among the people with her amiable smile, setting everybody at their ease by her kindly natural manner, and by the conviction which she gave them that she was thoroughly at her ease herself.

_The purposes for which a few shapeless pantries and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at Fullerton, were here carried on in appropriate divisions, commodious and roomy._<br/>There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought.

_The number of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than the number of their offices._<br/>I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him.

_Wherever they went, some pattened girl stopped to curtsy, or some footman in dishabille sneaked off._<br/>The lady smoothed down her dress, pushed back her hair under her little felt hat, and strode in through the hall-door, which was closed behind her.

_Yet this was an abbey!_<br/>But Justinian!

_How inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements from such as she had read about-- from abbeys and castles, in which, though certainly larger than Northanger, all the dirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost._<br/>That colour alone showed that she could be none other than the Empress; but the dignity of her carriage, the fierce authority of her magnificent dark eyes, and the perfect beauty of her haughty face, all proclaimed that it could only be that of Theodora who, in spite of her lowly origin, was the most majestic as well as the most maturely lovely of all the women in her kingdom.

_How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen; and, when Catherine saw what was necessary here, she began to be amazed herself._<br/>She began to praise you, I said what I felt, and then in an instant it was all out.''

_They returned to the hall, that the chief staircase might be ascended, and the beauty of its wood, and ornaments of rich carving might be pointed out: having gained the top, they turned in an opposite direction from the gallery in which her room lay, and shortly entered one on the same plan, but superior in length and breadth._<br/>' I falter where I firmly trod, And falling with my weight of cares Upon the great world's altar stairs, Which slope through darkness up to God, ' I stretch lame hands of faith and grope And gather dust and chaff, and call To what I feel is Lord of all, And faintly trust the larger hope.'

_She was here shown successively into three large bed-chambers, with their dressing-rooms, most completely and handsomely fitted up; everything that money and taste could do, to give comfort and elegance to apartments, had been bestowed on these; and, being furnished within the last five years, they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing, and wanting in all that could give pleasure to Catherine._<br/>There we left him then in the dim-lit London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman, while without, at the edge of the Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with it, his victory, which confined Napoleon's ambition for ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.

_As they were surveying the last, the general, after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured, turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine, and ventured to hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be`` our friends from Fullerton.''_<br/>How spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by Miss Julia Ames, who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication, but admitted, after fifteen years, that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over.

_She felt the unexpected compliment, and deeply regretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself, and so full of civility to all her family._<br/>He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.

_The gallery was terminated by folding doors, which Miss Tilney, advancing, had thrown open, and passed through, and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left, in another long reach of gallery, when the general, coming forwards, called her hastily, and, as Catherine thought, rather angrily back, demanding whether she were going?_<br/> As to the Emperor, some faint shadow of whom I have tried in these pages to raise before you, you have heard from history how, despairing of gaining command of the Channel, and fearing to attempt an invasion which might be cut off from behind, he abandoned the camp of Boulogne.

_-- And what was there more to be seen?_<br/>But there was something more here.

_-- Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?_<br/>Had she not herself told me that her very life might be at stake?

_-- And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise?_<br/>The most that she would concede was that she would not openly interfere with anything which her companions might say or do.

_Miss Tilney drew back directly, and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine, who, having seen, in a momentary glance beyond them, a narrower passage, more numerous openings, and symptoms of a winding staircase, believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice; and felt, as she unwillingly paced back the gallery, that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest._<br/>There we left him then in the dim-lit London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman, while without, at the edge of the Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with it, his victory, which confined Napoleon's ambition for ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.

_The general's evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant._<br/>The attitude of the greater part of the public might be described as one of attentive neutrality.

_Something was certainly to be concealed; her fancy, though it had trespassed lately once or twice, could not mislead her here; and what that something was, a short sentence of Miss Tilney's, as they followed the general at some distance downstairs, seemed to point out:`` I was going to take you into what was my mother's room-- the room in which she died--'' were all her words; but few as they were, they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_It was no wonder that the general should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain; a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed, which released his suffering wife, and left him to the stings of conscience._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_She ventured, when next alone with Eleanor, to express her wish of being permitted to see it, as well as all the rest of that side of the house; and Eleanor promised to attend her there, whenever they should have a convenient hour._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_Catherine understood her: the general must be watched from home, before that room could be entered._<br/>Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told us that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards opened the window.

_`` It remains as it was, I suppose?''_<br/>What was it, then?''

_said she, in a tone of feeling._<br/>said she in surprise.

_`` Yes, entirely.''_<br/>`` Entirely, sir-- entirely!''

_`` And how long ago may it be that your mother died?''_<br/>`` Why should he allow your mother to die and be buried without coming back?''

_`` She has been dead these nine years.''_<br/>`` Here he has sat for seven years.

_And nine years, Catherine knew, was a trifle of time, compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife, before her room was put to rights._<br/>Ten years before, a wretched woman, whose very name was an offence throughout the eastern world, where she was as infamous for her dishonour as famous for her beauty, had come to the monastery gate, and had persuaded the monks to take charge of her infant son, the child of her shame.

_`` You were with her, I suppose, to the last?''_<br/>`` But what am I to do with these now?''

_`` No,'' said Miss Tilney, sighing;`` I was unfortunately from home._<br/>`` No, Jim, I left the boards when-- when I was weary of them.

_Her illness was sudden and short; and, before I arrived it was all over.''_<br/>In truth, I was huffed with you when last we parted, but I have had you in my mind for all that.'

_Catherine's blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words._<br/> Jeremiah's blood ran cold a frightened man was` e, But he butted through the bushes just to see what' e could see, And there beneath their shadow, blood drippin' from his jaws, Was an awful creature standin' with a` ound beneath its paws.

_Could it be possible?_<br/>What can it be?

_Could Henry's father--?_<br/>What would your father say?

_And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest suspicions!_<br/>And yet it was at that very instant that the most terrible danger befell me.

_And, when she saw him in the evening, while she worked with her friend, slowly pacing the drawing-room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness, with downcast eyes and contracted brow, she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_It was the air and attitude of a Montoni!_<br/>`` But, by Jove, it was a close call!''

_What could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity, in its fearful review of past scenes of guilt?_<br/>Did I not, in my truest thoughts, always recurring and always dismissed, see past the beauty of the face, and, peering into the soul, discern the twin shadows of selfishness and of fickleness glooming at the back of it?

_Unhappy man!_<br/>Poor young man!''

_And the anxiousness of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly, as to catch Miss Tilney's notice._<br/>It was agony to him to hear that she was about to straighten little Alec Turner's club-foot, and right at the fringe of the rumour came a note from his mother, the rector's wife, asking him if he would be so good as to act as chloroformist.

_`` My father,'' she whispered,`` often walks about the room in this way; it is nothing unusual.''_<br/>When he said, therefore, that he hoped to see my mother very soon, and when he said that he had nothing to be ashamed of in that dark room, you may rely upon it that he meant it.''

_`` So much the worse!''_<br/>`` Worse and worse!

_thought Catherine; such ill-timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks, and boded nothing good._<br/>In spite of the darkness my companion walked with great assurance, never hesitating for an instant, and keeping up a stiff pace which was welcome to me in my sodden and benumbed condition.

_After an evening, the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry's importance among them, she was heartily glad to be dismissed; though it was a look from the general not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_When the butler would have lit his master's candle, however, he was forbidden._<br/>I was too soon, then, since he had not extinguished his candles.

_The latter was not going to retire._<br/>`` Then why not retire?''

_`` I have many pamphlets to finish,'' said he to Catherine,`` before I can close my eyes, and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep._<br/>At last, however, his long-drawn breathing assured me that he was asleep, and I was able to settle down to a few hours of welcome rest.

_Can either of us be more meetly employed?_<br/>Can I be of any assistance?

_My eyes will be blinding for the good of others, and yours preparing by rest for future mischief.''_<br/>I could see in his brutal eyes the satisfaction which it would give him if he could find some excuse for plunging it into my body.

_But neither the business alleged, nor the magnificent compliment, could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose._<br/> You will observe that from the beginning of this affair I had never once opened my mouth, nor said a word in my defence, which made me mightily pleased with myself afterwards, though my silence came rather from pride than from courage.

_To be kept up for hours, after the family were in bed, by stupid pamphlets was not very likely._<br/>We had not so much to fear from them during the day, but they would be very likely to rush us by night; so the sooner we got away from their neighborhood the better.

_There must be some deeper cause: something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept; and the probability that Mrs. Tilney yet lived, shut up for causes unknown, and receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food, was the conclusion which necessarily followed._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_Shocking as was the idea, it was at least better than a death unfairly hastened, as, in the natural course of things, she must ere long be released._<br/>When he spoke of seeing her again so soon, he was referring to her own approaching death, which he had been assured could not be delayed more than a very few months.

_The suddenness of her reputed illness, the absence of her daughter, and probably of her other children, at the time-- all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment._<br/>He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.

_Its origin-- jealousy perhaps, or wanton cruelty-- was yet to be unravelled._<br/>Avarice, revenge, anxiety, love, and pity have all been known to have this effect.

_In revolving these matters, while she undressed, it suddenly struck her as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very spot of this unfortunate woman's confinement-- might have been within a few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days; for what part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which yet bore the traces of monastic division?_<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_In the high-arched passage, paved with stone, which already she had trodden with peculiar awe, she well remembered the doors of which the general had given no account._<br/>It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors.

_To what might not those doors lead?_<br/>We can not say what it may lead to.''

_In support of the plausibility of this conjecture, it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery, in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney, must be, as certainly as her memory could guide her, exactly over this suspected range of cells, and the staircase by the side of those apartments of which she had caught a transient glimpse, communicating by some secret means with those cells, might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_Down that staircase she had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well-prepared insensibility!_<br/>At the end of it, at the foot of the stairs, Mrs. Deacon was lying senseless, struck down by the sight which she had seen.

_Catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises, and sometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far; but they were supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible._<br/> I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed.

_The side of the quadrangle, in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting, being, according to her belief, just opposite her own, it struck her that, if judiciously watched, some rays of light from the general's lamp might glimmer through the lower windows, as he passed to the prison of his wife; and, twice before she stepped into bed, she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery, to see if it appeared; but all abroad was dark, and it must yet be too early._<br/> But in spite of gleams of sunshine, there was thunder in the air, and Champion Harrison had just whispered in my ear that he was quite sure that we should never get through the night without trouble, and was advising me, if it got very bad, to take refuge under the table, when the landlord entered the room hurriedly and handed a note to my uncle.

_The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up._<br/>What did it matter to me if she hated the sound of his voice, or if he put every indignity upon her in the hope of breaking her spirit, and spoke to her as he would never have dared to speak to one of his servants?

_Till midnight, she supposed it would be in vain to watch; but then, when the clock had struck twelve, and all was quiet, she would, if not quite appalled by darkness, steal out and look once more._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The clock struck twelve-- and Catherine had been half an hour asleep._<br/>It told him that it was half-past seven, and that he had been gone an hour and a quarter.

_CHAPTER 24  The next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartments._<br/>  III  B. 24  I told my story when I was taken, and no one would listen to me.

_It was Sunday, and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home; and great as was Catherine's curiosity, her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner, either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o'clock, or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp._<br/>Upon the third day, towards evening, I observed to my extreme surprise that the ship was under the influence of a very powerful current, which ran to the north-east with such violence that she was carried, now bows on, now stern on, and occasionally drifting sideways like a crab, at a rate which I can not compute at less than twelve or fifteen knots an hour.

_The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs. Tilney, which immediately fronted the family pew._<br/>I have some dim remembrance of an ancient church upon an eminence, and of a quaint stone cross within the market-place, but assuredly, of all the recollections which I retain of Bruton there is none so pleasing as that of the buxom landlady's face, and of the steaming dishes which she lost no time in setting before us.

_By that her eye was instantly caught and long retained; and the perusal of the highly strained epitaph, in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the inconsolable husband, who must have been in some way or other her destroyer, affected her even to tears._<br/>And she, the polluted one, had risen to the dignity, had cut herself sternly away from all that related to her past life, and had shown signs already of being a great Queen, stronger and wiser than her husband, but fierce, vindictive, and unbending, a firm support to her friends, but a terror to her foes.

_That the general, having erected such a monument, should be able to face it, was not perhaps very strange, and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view, maintain so elevated an air, look so fearlessly around, nay, that he should even enter the church, seemed wonderful to Catherine._<br/> It was a sight which I shall never forget until my dying day-- so weird, so impossible, that I do not know how I am to make you realize it, or how in a few years I shall bring myself to believe in it if I live to sit once more on a lounge in the Savage Club and look out on the drab solidity of the Embankment.

_Not, however, that many instances of beings equally hardened in guilt might not be produced._<br/>Neither could have been aware of the existence of the other, and yet the two accounts are so alike as to be practically the same.

_She could remember dozens who had persevered in every possible vice, going on from crime to crime, murdering whomsoever they chose, without any feeling of humanity or remorse; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their black career._<br/>She went on to say that the sphere she inhabited was all round the earth; that she knew about the planets; that Mars was inhabited by a race more advanced than us, and that the canals were artificial; there was no bodily pain in her sphere, but there could be mental anxiety; they were governed; they took nourishment; she had been a Catholic and was still a Catholic, but had not fared better than the Protestants; there were Buddhists and Mohammedans in her sphere, but all fared alike; she had never seen Christ and knew no more about Him than on earth, but believed in His influence; spirits prayed and they died in their new sphere before entering another; they had pleasures-- music was among them.

_The erection of the monument itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney's actual decease._<br/>`` If my gracious master-- the ever-glorious Emperor Justinian-- does not disdain to take me into his most intimate confidence in all things, it would be strange if there were any subject within your knowledge which I might not hear.

_Were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber, were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to be enclosed-- what could it avail in such a case?_<br/>Her aunt on one side of her and Mr. Stephens on the other did all they could to soothe her, and at last the weary, over-strung girl relapsed into something between a sleep and a faint, hanging limp over her pommel, and only kept from falling by the friends who clustered round her.

_Catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be introduced, and a supposititious funeral carried on._<br/>She agreed that religion was based upon the Bible, but the Bible was a book which contained much that was obscure, and unless that obscurity were cleared away by a duly elected and consecrated servant of God, a lineal descendant of the Disciples, all human wisdom might not serve to interpret it aright.

_The succeeding morning promised something better._<br/> I promised to do so if possible.

_The general's early walk, ill-timed as it was in every other view, was favourable here; and when she knew him to be out of the house, she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her promise._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_Eleanor was ready to oblige her; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise, their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed-chamber._<br/>Mrs. Cooper was of opinion that if I were to call it might alarm him, so it was agreed between us that she should send him up in the evening on some pretext to my consulting-room, which would give me the opportunity of having a chat with him and, if I were convinced of his insanity, of signing his certificate.

_It represented a very lovely woman, with a mild and pensive countenance, justifying, so far, the expectations of its new observer; but they were not in every respect answered, for Catherine had depended upon meeting with features, hair, complexion, that should be the very counterpart, the very image, if not of Henry's, of Eleanor's-- the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking, bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_A face once taken was taken for generations._<br/>We have been together so many years.

_But here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness._<br/>For this reason I asked you to return with me, as I was minded to make your further acquaintance.

_She contemplated it, however, in spite of this drawback, with much emotion, and, but for a yet stronger interest, would have left it unwillingly._<br/>If love had not come to her yet, there was at least pity and sympathy, which are nearly akin to it.

_Her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse; she could only look at her companion._<br/> She started, and turned upon me her great dark, questioning eyes with a look in which surprise, incredulity, and something akin to horror seemed to be struggling for mastery.

_Eleanor's countenance was dejected, yet sedate; and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing._<br/>Clara's reserved and refined nature shrank somewhat from the boisterous frankness and strange manners of the widow, and yet her feminine instinct told her that beneath all her peculiarities there lay much that was good and noble.

_Again she passed through the folding doors, again her hand was upon the important lock, and Catherine, hardly able to breathe, was turning to close the former with fearful caution, when the figure, the dreaded figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery, stood before her!_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The name of`` Eleanor'' at the same moment, in his loudest tone, resounded through the building, giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence, and to Catherine terror upon terror._<br/>She carried herself in the most stately fashion, so that as I looked at her majestic entrance, and at the pose which she struck as she glanced at my father, I was reminded of the Queen of the Peruvians as, in the person of Miss Polly Hinton, she incited Boy Jim and myself to insurrection.

_An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him, yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye; and when her friend, who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her, had joined and disappeared with him, she ran for safety to her own room, and, locking herself in, believed that she should never have courage to go down again._<br/>`` It is singular that I, who had never feared him in life, should be frightened at him now, and yet when I looked at him, and saw that all was motionless save the creeping stain upon the carpet, I was seized with a sudden foolish spasm of terror, and, catching up my knife, I fled swiftly and silently back to my own room, closing the panels behind me.

_She remained there at least an hour, in the greatest agitation, deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend, and expecting a summons herself from the angry general to attend him in his own apartment._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_No summons, however, arrived; and at last, on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey, she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors._<br/>So artfully had the site of his cottage been chosen, that when we looked back to give him a last greeting both he and his dwelling had disappeared already from our view, nor could we, among the many mounds and hollows, determine where the cottage lay which had given us such welcome shelter.

_The breakfast-room was gay with company; and she was named to them by the general as the friend of his daughter, in a complimentary style, which so well concealed his resentful ire, as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present._<br/> I could have explained that it was because he had betrayed his comrades, because his daughter hated him, because he had ill-used his wife, because my father regarded him as the source of all his troubles-- but the salon of the Empress was no place for a family quarrel, so I merely shrugged my shoulders, and was silent.

_And Eleanor, with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character, taking an early occasion of saying to her,`` My father only wanted me to answer a note,'' she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the general, or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_Upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence, after the company left them, and nothing occurred to disturb it._<br/>From that time I have never heard him allude to the matter, nor did he ever give us any reason why he should so confidently have expected the second coming upon that particular night.

_In the course of this morning's reflections, she came to a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone._<br/> I thought of the solicitude which he had shown over my toilet in the morning, his anxiety that I should make a favourable impression, his displeasure when she had been cold to me, and the smile upon his face when he had seen us hand in hand.

_It would be much better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter._<br/>I believe that you could do it better than any one.

_To involve her in the danger of a second detection, to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart, could not be the office of a friend._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The general's utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter; and, besides, she thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion._<br/>The lady came, not altogether with the approval of her husband, and though she never gave indications of any very great psychic force, we were able, at least, to obtain those usual phenomena of message-tilting which are at the same time so puerile and so inexplicable.

_It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions, from which the other had, in all likelihood, been hitherto happily exempt; nor could she therefore, in her presence, search for those proofs of the general's cruelty, which however they might yet have escaped discovery, she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth, in the shape of some fragmented journal, continued to the last gasp._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress; and as she wished to get it over before Henry's return, who was expected on the morrow, there was no time to be lost._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The day was bright, her courage high; at four o'clock, the sun was now two hours above the horizon, and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual._<br/>Upon the third day, towards evening, I observed to my extreme surprise that the ship was under the influence of a very powerful current, which ran to the north-east with such violence that she was carried, now bows on, now stern on, and occasionally drifting sideways like a crab, at a rate which I can not compute at less than twelve or fifteen knots an hour.

_It was done; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike._<br/>`` My mother and I were gradually compelled to sell the furniture and to dismiss the servants, until now, as you see, I am living unattended in a single room.

_It was no time for thought; she hurried on, slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors, and without stopping to look or breathe, rushed forward to the one in question._<br/>It was no wonder that from below we had not observed the place, as the cliffs curved overhead and an ascent at the spot would have seemed so impossible as to discourage close inspection.

_The lock yielded to her hand, and, luckily, with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being._<br/>There could not be the least doubt that it was this which the fellow had striven so frantically to conceal upon the first alarm of the approach of a stranger.

_On tiptoe she entered; the room was before her; but it was some minutes before she could advance another step._<br/>Then she took her taper and walked quickly into the room from which we had come.

_She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature._<br/>She began to praise you, I said what I felt, and then in an instant it was all out.''

_She saw a large, well-proportioned apartment, an handsome dimity bed, arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid's care, a bright Bath stove, mahogany wardrobes, and neatly painted chairs, on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows!_<br/> It was indeed wonderful how, with the self-respect and sense of propriety of the British housekeeper, the lady had within a few minutes adorned the central table with a snow-white cloth, laid the napkins upon it, and set forth the simple meal with all the elegance of civilization, including an electric torch lamp in the centre.

_Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked, and worked they were._<br/>I wish to goodness she had called me.''

_Astonishment and doubt first seized them; and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame._<br/>That vicious, threatening smile which might once have thrilled them left them now unmoved-- or stirred them at most to vague resentment.

_She could not be mistaken as to the room; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!_<br/>It may not be against you, but I know not what else can have angered him.'

_-- in Miss Tilney's meaning, in her own calculation!_<br/>O Miss Adams, Miss Adams, it is they!''

_This apartment, to which she had given a date so ancient, a position so awful, proved to be one end of what the general's father had built._<br/>` When the castle passed into my hands, one of the very first things which I did was to cut a new opening at the end of it, for I foresaw that in these troublesome times it might be of use to me; indeed, had it been in repair it might have made the escape of your mother and father a very much easier affair.'

_There were two other doors in the chamber, leading probably into dressing-closets; but she had no inclination to open either._<br/>I was not any nearer to escape than I had been before, for there was no other wooden wall which I could penetrate and the spring lock of the door had been closed.

_Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked, or the volume in which she had last read, remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper?_<br/>I had expected to find my Cousin Sibylle there, but to my surprise there was no sign of her, nor had she left any word to tell us whither she had gone.

_No: whatever might have been the general's crimes, he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection._<br/>This I concealed where no one has ever discovered it; but my fears would not allow me to go back for the other, as I might perhaps have done, had I foreseen how terribly its presence might tell against my master.

_She was sick of exploring, and desired but to be safe in her own room, with her own heart only privy to its folly; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered, when the sound of footsteps, she could hardly tell where, made her pause and tremble._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_To be found there, even by a servant, would be unpleasant; but by the general-LRB- and he seemed always at hand when least wanted-RRB-, much worse!_<br/>So far all had been kindly, however far apart our desires might be; but we felt well assured that our actual plans of a descent must be kept secret, for we had reason to fear that at the last they might try to hold us by force.

_She listened-- the sound had ceased; and resolving not to lose a moment, she passed through and closed the door._<br/>She could not forget the scrap of conversation which she had heard the night before, nor the secret which her sister had refused to confide to her.

_At that instant a door underneath was hastily opened; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs, by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery._<br/>For an hour I could hear the dialogue beneath-- the high voice and the low, with clatter of cup and clink of spoon, until at last a light, quick step passed my study door, and I knew that my new fellow-lodger had sought her room.

_She had no power to move._<br/>He had no desire to be offensive.

_With a feeling of terror not very definable, she fixed her eyes on the staircase, and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view._<br/>By ignoring the fact of her being a human being, and looking upon her as a useful automatic machine, I accustomed myself to her presence so far as to miss her on the few occasions when she was not at her post.

_`` Mr. Tilney!''_<br/>Colonel Gerard!''

_she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment._<br/>she asked, with something appealing in her voice and expression.

_He looked astonished too._<br/>said he, in amazement.

_`` Good God!''_<br/>Good Lord!

_she continued, not attending to his address._<br/>She did not try to draw it back from him.

_`` How came you here?_<br/>How came you there?'

_How came you up that staircase?''_<br/>How came he into the room?''

_`` How came I up that staircase!''_<br/>`` I wonder whence that stair leads?''

_he replied, greatly surprised._<br/>he replied earnestly.'

_`` Because it is my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber; and why should I not come up it?''_<br/>`` If the cave does not go through I do not understand why this person, who has every reason to mean us well, should have drawn our attention to it.

_Catherine recollected herself, blushed deeply, and could say no more._<br/>' I have no doubt that you would like to have nothing more to do with me,' he cried.

_He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford._<br/>He did not appear to be paying the least attention to me, but it seems that he was really watching me closely, for he turned upon me when he had finished his dictation.

_She moved on towards the gallery._<br/>She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him.

_`` And may I not, in my turn,'' said he, as he pushed back the folding doors,`` ask how you came here?_<br/>I could not see the door by which he had entered, nor could I see him where he stood, but I heard all that he had to say.

_This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast-parlour to your apartment, as that staircase can be from the stables to mine.''_<br/>As a matter of fact we have had least to bear, for it has been our task from the beginning to guard the base of the peninsula upon which this extraordinary town is built.

_`` I have been,'' said Catherine, looking down,`` to see your mother's room.''_<br/> When the Doctor came down to the dining-room next morning, he was surprised to find that his daughters had already been up some time.

_`` My mother's room!_<br/>`` Hush, mother!''

_Is there anything extraordinary to be seen there?''_<br/>Is there anything else?''

_`` No, nothing at all._<br/>`` No, no, not at all.

_I thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow.''_<br/>So I did not look up till all was finished.

_`` I did not expect to be able to return sooner, when I went away; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me._<br/>`` I waited as it seemed to me for at least an hour; but I had no watch, and my impatience was such that I dare say it really was little more than a quarter of that time.

_You look pale._<br/>`` You are pale.

_I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs._<br/>I am afraid that I have been somewhat carried away by it.''

_Perhaps you did not know-- you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use?''_<br/>If I did not make the course of events clear to you, you would hardly understand the influences which had such an effect upon my whole history.

_`` No, I was not._<br/>`` No, I have not.''

_You have had a very fine day for your ride.''_<br/>We've had a good time together.

_`` Very; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself?''_<br/>`` Did you enter _ all _ the rooms?''

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_No; she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday-- and we were coming here to these rooms-- but only''-- dropping her voice--`` your father was with us.''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` And that prevented you,'' said Henry, earnestly regarding her._<br/>`` But you must leave me,'' said Miss Adams, earnestly.

_`` Have you looked into all the rooms in that passage?''_<br/>How came he into the room?''

_`` No, I only wanted to see-- Is not it very late?_<br/>`` No, no, I'll not go first.''

_I must go and dress.''_<br/>I must go.

_`` It is only a quarter past four'' showing his watch--`` and you are not now in Bath._<br/>`` It is an old one now-- fourteen years old-- and yet they have not got to the end of it.

_No theatre, no rooms to prepare for._<br/>Stern facts here,-- no room for theories.

_Half an hour at Northanger must be enough.''_<br/>`` If now my hour be truly come, Ah well, it must be now!''

_She could not contradict it, and therefore suffered herself to be detained, though her dread of further questions made her, for the first time in their acquaintance, wish to leave him._<br/> It was not until he had received his apology that our touchy friend would suffer himself to be appeased.

_They walked slowly up the gallery._<br/>He closed the door behind them and paced slowly up and down the room.

_`` Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you?''_<br/>You had a letter from him inviting you to leave England and to come here, had you not?'

_`` No, and I am very much surprised._<br/>`` No-- but deeply disappointed.''

_Isabella promised so faithfully to write directly.''_<br/>I have just promised Mrs. Westmacott that I will do so.

_`` Promised so faithfully!_<br/>`` Well, well!

_A faithful promise!_<br/>Promise me!''

_That puzzles me._<br/>But this should puzzle'em.''

_I have heard of a faithful performance._<br/>I have heard the name.''

_But a faithful promise-- the fidelity of promising!_<br/>`` But you will make me a promise?''

_It is a power little worth knowing, however, since it can deceive and pain you._<br/>It is true that this, like every other power, may be abused if we lose our general sense of proportion and of reason.

_My mother's room is very commodious, is it not?_<br/>Your wife's heart is not strong, and she has some symptoms which I do not like.

_Large and cheerful-looking, and the dressing-closets so well disposed!_<br/>Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful.

_It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house, and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own._<br/>Your mother will think that I am clean crazy, and I'd never dare to look her in the eye if anything went wrong with us.

_She sent you to look at it, I suppose?''_<br/>Where could I send her, and what could I do with her?

_`` No.''_<br/>`` No.''

_`` It has been your own doing entirely?''_<br/>`` I have said that the conditions are entirely different.''

_Catherine said nothing._<br/>`` It was nothing.

_After a short silence, during which he had closely observed her, he added,`` As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity, this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother's character, as described by Eleanor, which does honour to her memory._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The world, I believe, never saw a better woman._<br/>I have never looked with the eyes of love upon another woman.

_But it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this._<br/>It is not much, but I can do it well.'

_The domestic, unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent, venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours._<br/>Since the spirit is by its very nature invisible, we can not see these comings and goings, but we see their effect in the body of the subject, now rigid and inert, now struggling to narrate impressions which could never have come to it by natural means.

_Eleanor, I suppose, has talked of her a great deal?''_<br/>She had a good deal to say for herself on that also.

_`` Yes, a great deal._<br/>`` Very good, sarr!

_That is-- no, not much, but what she did say was very interesting._<br/>And indeed it was no wonder, for that name was never mentioned unless it were in connection with something brilliant and extraordinary.

_Her dying so suddenly''-LRB- slowly, and with hesitation it was spoken-RRB-,`` and you-- none of you being at home-- and your father, I thought-- perhaps had not been very fond of her.''_<br/>The lady came, not altogether with the approval of her husband, and though she never gave indications of any very great psychic force, we were able, at least, to obtain those usual phenomena of message-tilting which are at the same time so puerile and so inexplicable.

_`` And from these circumstances,'' he replied-LRB- his quick eye fixed on hers-RRB-,`` you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence-- some''---LRB- involuntarily she shook her head-RRB---`` or it may be-- of something still less pardonable.''_<br/>` Do not judge my father by his words, but by his deeds,' said she, with a warning finger upraised;` and, above all, Cousin Louis, unless you wish to have my life upon your conscience, never let him suspect that I have said a word to set you on your guard.'

_She raised her eyes towards him more fully than she had ever done before._<br/>We were all taking the matter much more seriously than we had ever done before.

_`` My mother's illness,'' he continued,`` the seizure which ended in her death, was sudden._<br/>My mother had been unable to accept the possibility up to now, but when I told her this she collapsed and fainted.

_The malady itself, one from which she had often suffered, a bilious fever-- its cause therefore constitutional._<br/>Well, as luck would have it, she developed rheumatic fever, which left her heart very much affected.

_On the third day, in short, as soon as she could be prevailed on, a physician attended her, a very respectable man, and one in whom she had always placed great confidence._<br/>But now he felt that he was really of some use to her, that every hour she was learning to turn to him as one turns to one's natural protector; and above all, he had begun to find himself-- to understand that there really was a strong, reliable man behind all the tricks of custom which had built up an artificial nature, which had imposed even upon himself.

_Upon his opinion of her danger, two others were called in the next day, and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours._<br/>For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner.

_On the fifth day she died._<br/>In five minutes he died.

_During the progress of her disorder, Frederick and I-LRB- we were both at home-RRB- saw her repeatedly; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her, or which her situation in life could command._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Poor Eleanor was absent, and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin.''_<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_`` But your father,'' said Catherine,`` was he afflicted?''_<br/>' I am he,' said my father.

_`` For a time, greatly so._<br/>`` Yes, that is so.''

_You have erred in supposing him not attached to her._<br/>`` If the ladies had not seen you, I should never have ventured to believe it.''

_He loved her, I am persuaded, as well as it was possible for him to-- we have not all, you know, the same tenderness of disposition-- and I will not pretend to say that while she lived, she might not often have had much to bear, but though his temper injured her, his judgment never did._<br/>I can not think how the historian of the future can hope to understand them, when I, who knew one of them so well, and bore his blood in my veins, could never quite tell how much of him was real, and how much was due to the affectations which he had cultivated so long that they had ceased to deserve the name.

_His value of her was sincere; and, if not permanently, he was truly afflicted by her death.''_<br/>For my own part I was not so very anxious that she should save this craven lover of hers, whose handsome face belied the poor spirit within him.

_`` I am very glad of it,'' said Catherine;`` it would have been very shocking!''_<br/>`` I am sure that he would be very glad to see you, sir.

_`` If I understand you rightly, you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to-- Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained._<br/>` Until my comrade returns, Sir Gervas,' said I,` you might, since the subject does not appear to be a painful one to you, let us know how these evil times, which you bear with such philosophy, came upon you.'

_What have you been judging from?_<br/>`` What have you done?''

_Remember the country and the age in which we live._<br/>Where will you-- where will your city be within the year?

_Remember that we are English, that we are Christians._<br/>`` I see,'' he said,`` you are the Mormons.''

_Consult your own understanding, your own sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing around you._<br/>If that is your view, you will permit me to say that you know very little of the matter.

_Does our education prepare us for such atrocities?_<br/>Does that satisfy you?''

_Do our laws connive at them?_<br/>What do you want to aggravate him for?''

_Could they be perpetrated without being known, in a country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing, where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay everything open?_<br/>Sometimes you learn that it has been Roman, sometimes Egyptian, sometimes all record of its name or origin has been absolutely lost, You ask yourself in amazement why any race should build in so uncouth a solitude, and you find it difficult to accept the theory that this has only been of value as a guard-house to the richer country down below, and that these frequent cities have been so many fortresses to hold off the wild and predatory men of the south.

_Dearest Miss Morland, what ideas have you been admitting?''_<br/>`` My dear Mrs. Westmacott,'' cried Clara,`` I assure you that I have not the least idea what it is that you are talking of.''

_They had reached the end of the gallery, and with tears of shame she ran off to her own room._<br/> I had gone down with them, and after I had seen Lucia in tears it appeared to me that the plaster would crack if it were taken from the support of the wall.

_CHAPTER 25  The visions of romance were over._<br/>  A STRAGGLER OF' 15.

_Catherine was completely awakened._<br/>It was absolutely and completely empty.

_Henry's address, short as it had been, had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done._<br/>Then, just as I had hoped that all was settled, in came young Mr. Brummell, who promised to be an even greater exquisite than my uncle, and the whole matter had to be thrashed out between them.

_Most grievously was she humbled._<br/>As it was, I was helpless.

_Most bitterly did she cry._<br/>cried the woman, bitterly.

_It was not only with herself that she was sunk-- but with Henry._<br/>It was not until he had signed and sent it off that the full significance of all that he had done broke upon him.

_Her folly, which now seemed even criminal, was all exposed to him, and he must despise her forever._<br/>Above all, I could not conceal from myself that his past life was not such as to make even so abominable a crime as this impossible to him.

_The liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father-- could he ever forgive it?_<br/>What did it matter to me if she hated the sound of his voice, or if he put every indignity upon her in the hope of breaking her spirit, and spoke to her as he would never have dared to speak to one of his servants?

_The absurdity of her curiosity and her fears-- could they ever be forgotten?_<br/>What did it matter to me if she hated the sound of his voice, or if he put every indignity upon her in the hope of breaking her spirit, and spoke to her as he would never have dared to speak to one of his servants?

_She hated herself more than she could express._<br/>She hated him so that she would even lower her pride to take such a man as me into her confidence if she could gain her end by doing so.

_He had-- she thought he had, once or twice before this fatal morning, shown something like affection for her._<br/>I learned that Parmes had seen her before I did, and had shown her that he too loved her, but I could smile at his passion, for I knew that her heart was mine.

_But now-- in short, she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour, went down when the clock struck five, with a broken heart, and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to Eleanor's inquiry if she was well._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The formidable Henry soon followed her into the room, and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual._<br/>But, as I afterwards learned, their conversation was to be about myself and my own prospects, so I was despatched to my room, whence far into the night I could hear the deep growl of my father and the rich tones of my uncle, with an occasional gentle murmur from my mother, as they talked in the room beneath.

_Catherine had never wanted comfort more, and he looked as if he was aware of it._<br/>I never dreamed of giving nor did he of claiming it.

_The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness; and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity._<br/> It was no affectation upon my part to say that the prospect of my night's adventure was an agreeable one.

_She did not learn either to forget or defend the past; but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther, and that it might not cost her Henry's entire regard._<br/>She and I never took to each other very much; but now I hope all that may be ended, and when I marry she will come and stay with me.''

_Her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had with such causeless terror felt and done, nothing could shortly be clearer than that it had been all a voluntary, self-created delusion, each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved on alarm, and everything forced to bend to one purpose by a mind which, before she entered the abbey, had been craving to be frightened._<br/>She went on to say that the sphere she inhabited was all round the earth; that she knew about the planets; that Mars was inhabited by a race more advanced than us, and that the canals were artificial; there was no bodily pain in her sphere, but there could be mental anxiety; they were governed; they took nourishment; she had been a Catholic and was still a Catholic, but had not fared better than the Protestants; there were Buddhists and Mohammedans in her sphere, but all fared alike; she had never seen Christ and knew no more about Him than on earth, but believed in His influence; spirits prayed and they died in their new sphere before entering another; they had pleasures-- music was among them.

_She remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of Northanger._<br/>She spoke just now as if she had mentioned the plan which I had conceived to you.

_She saw that the infatuation had been created, the mischief settled, long before her quitting Bath, and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had there indulged._<br/> In that instant there flashed before Theodora's mind a vision of all her enemies, of all those who envied her rise, of all whose hatred and contempt would rise into a clamour of delight could they see the daughter of the bearward hurled down again into that abyss from which she had been dragged.

_Charming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe's works, and charming even as were the works of all her imitators, it was not in them perhaps that human nature, at least in the Midland counties of England, was to be looked for._<br/> My story is one which you may well treasure up in your memories, and tell again to others, for it is not likely that in this whole county of Hampshire, or even perhaps in all England, there is another left alive who is so well able to speak from his own knowledge of these events, or who has played a more forward part in them.

_Of the Alps and Pyrenees, with their pine forests and their vices, they might give a faithful delineation; and Italy, Switzerland, and the south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there represented._<br/> This was a question on which, as may be imagined, Saxon had much to say, and the pair were soon involved in a heated discussion, in which the experiences of Roundway Down and Marston Moor were balanced against the results of a score of unpronounceable fights in the Styrian Alps and along the Danube.

_Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country, and even of that, if hard pressed, would have yielded the northern and western extremities._<br/>I doubt not that where more loud-tongued and assertive dames might be cowed, the Mayor's soft-voiced daughter would begin to cast off her gentler disposition, and to show the stronger nature which underlay it.

_But in the central part of England there was surely some security for the existence even of a wife not beloved, in the laws of the land, and the manners of the age._<br/>`` If it were not for our great ancestors and for our beloved country, the Queen of the Waters,'' said he,`` I could find it in my heart to be glad at this destruction which has come upon this vain and feeble generation.

_Murder was not tolerated, servants were not slaves, and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured, like rhubarb, from every druggist._<br/>`` But,'' I cried,`` surely the whole experience of the human race is not to be set aside on account of a single sketch''-- I had turned over the leaves and ascertained that there was nothing more in the book--`` a single sketch by a wandering American artist who may have done it under hashish, or in the delirium of fever, or simply in order to gratify a freakish imagination.

_Among the Alps and Pyrenees, perhaps, there were no mixed characters._<br/>`` We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains.''

_There, such as were not as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend._<br/>There could not be the least doubt that it was this which the fellow had striven so frantically to conceal upon the first alarm of the approach of a stranger.

_But in England it was not so; among the English, she believed, in their hearts and habits, there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad._<br/>`` If it were not for our great ancestors and for our beloved country, the Queen of the Waters,'' said he,`` I could find it in my heart to be glad at this destruction which has come upon this vain and feeble generation.

_Upon this conviction, she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney, some slight imperfection might hereafter appear; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father, who, though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained, she did believe, upon serious consideration, to be not perfectly amiable._<br/>All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,-- for you have not done me a very good turn,-- but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.''

_Her mind made up on these several points, and her resolution formed, of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense, she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever; and the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in the course of another day._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_Henry's astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct, in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed, was of the greatest assistance to her; and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress, her spirits became absolutely comfortable, and capable, as heretofore, of continual improvement by anything he said._<br/>The less experienced a doctor is, the higher are his notions of professional dignity, as I need not remind you, my young friend, so I was about to refuse the commission with indignation, when I bethought me that, quite apart from medicine, we were gentleman and lady, and that she had asked me to do something for her which was evidently of the greatest possible importance in her eyes.

_There were still some subjects, indeed, under which she believed they must always tremble-- the mention of a chest or a cabinet, for instance-- and she did not love the sight of japan in any shape: but even she could allow that an occasional memento of past folly, however painful, might not be without use._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of romance._<br/> This, then, as well as the waters which join us to the world, has done something to tinge us with romance.

_Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater._<br/>She began to praise you, I said what I felt, and then in an instant it was all out.''

_She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on, and how the rooms were attended; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella's having matched some fine netting-cotton, on which she had left her intent; and of her continuing on the best terms with James._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella._<br/>The only words of which she could think were`` My goodness me!''

_James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton._<br/>Mr. James Stephens has refused to put his version of the matter into writing, but as these proofs have been submitted to him, and no correction or deletion has been made in them, it may be supposed that he has not succeeded in detecting any grave misstatement of fact, and that any objection which he may have to their publication depends rather upon private and personal scruples.

_But Isabella had promised and promised again; and when she promised a thing, she was so scrupulous in performing it!_<br/>He had faithfully promised to stay where he was, and we had not a doubt that he would be as good as his word.

_This made it so particularly strange!_<br/>And how strangely made!

_For nine successive mornings, Catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment, which each morning became more severe: but, on the tenth, when she entered the breakfast-room, her first object was a letter, held out by Henry's willing hand._<br/>*****  It was the eve of my departure from Kirkby-Malhouse that we sat upon the green bank in the garden, she with dark, dreamy eyes looking sadly out over the sombre fells; while I, with a book upon my knee, glanced covertly at her lovely profile and marvelled to myself how twenty years of life could have stamped so sad and wistful an expression upon it.

_She thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself.''_<br/>She began to praise you, I said what I felt, and then in an instant it was all out.''

_'T is only from James, however,'' as she looked at the direction._<br/>It is not a mere picture upon which I look.

_She opened it; it was from Oxford; and to this purpose: `` Dear Catherine, `` Though, God knows, with little inclination for writing, I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me._<br/>`` My Lady Avon and gentlemen,'' said he,`` if I have sinned in this matter, and I freely confess that I have done so, I only know one way in which I can atone for it, and that is by making the full and complete confession which my noble master, Lord Avon, has demanded.

_I left her and Bath yesterday, never to see either again._<br/>`` You heard the missus say that if she let me off this time I was never to ask again.

_I shall not enter into particulars-- they would only pain you more._<br/>I will not enter into any argument or speculation.

_You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned._<br/>He knew Jeremiah and he mistrusted him, however; so instead of giving him all that he meant him to have he handed me over a part of it, telling me, with what was almost his dying breath, to hold it in trust for my brother, and to use it in his behalf when he should have squandered or lost all that he had.

_Thank God!_<br/>`` Thank God!

_I am undeceived in time!_<br/>I am myself again.

_But it is a heavy blow!_<br/>It was a frightful blow.

_After my father's consent had been so kindly given-- but no more of this._<br/>Yet I dare say if he could have seen into his wife's mind-- but there, I say no more!

_She has made me miserable forever!_<br/>She's got to be worse, poor dear, before she can be better.

_Let me soon hear from you, dear Catherine; you are my only friend; your love I do build upon._<br/>But I know your plans, and my Cousin Louis knows them also, and I can assure you that there is just as much chance of his agreeing to them as there is of my doing so.

_I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known, or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced._<br/>I hope, madam, by the King's generosity and goodness, and your intercession, I may hope for my life which if I have shall be ever employed in showing to your Majesty all the sense immaginable of gratitude, and in serving of the King like a true subject.

_Poor Thorpe is in town: I dread the sight of him; his honest heart would feel so much._<br/>In my heart I longed that the time would come, for I was weary of the quiet life of the village, and was anxious to see the great world of which I had heard and read so much.

_I have written to him and my father._<br/>I told him who was his father.

_Her duplicity hurts me more than all; till the very last, if I reasoned with her, she declared herself as much attached to me as ever, and laughed at my fears._<br/>In spite of his smile, I was more conscious than ever that my whole soul shrank from him, and that I should not be at my ease until I had broken this companionship which had been so involuntarily formed.

_I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved, I was that man._<br/>`` I am as glad to see you as ever I was to see a man in my life, but I confess that I did not expect you.''

_I can not understand even now what she would be at, for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney._<br/>But I can not pretend to understand how this matter stands, and you must allow me to say that I have not heard you advance anything yet which seems to me to justify you in abandoning your engagements at a moment's notice.''

_We parted at last by mutual consent-- happy for me had we never met!_<br/>From that time I have never heard him allude to the matter, nor did he ever give us any reason why he should so confidently have expected the second coming upon that particular night.

_I can never expect to know such another woman!_<br/>I have never looked with the eyes of love upon another woman.

_Dearest Catherine, beware how you give your heart._<br/>Dear me, dear me, you poor souls, how my heart does bleed for you!

_`` Believe me,''& c.  Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance, and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder, declared her to be receiving unpleasant news; and Henry, earnestly watching her through the whole letter, saw plainly that it ended no better than it began._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_He was prevented, however, from even looking his surprise by his father's entrance._<br/>Even worse, however, did this marriage appear when looked at from the point of view of her father's future.

_They went to breakfast directly; but Catherine could hardly eat anything._<br/>I saw him at breakfast, but afterward neither he nor his horse was to be seen.

_Tears filled her eyes, and even ran down her cheeks as she sat._<br/>cried the clerk, and the tears were running down his cheeks.

_The letter was one moment in her hand, then in her lap, and then in her pocket; and she looked as if she knew not what she did._<br/>It was not until I had kissed her and kissed her again upon her lips, her cheeks, her hair, that I could persuade myself that she was indeed really there.

_The general, between his cocoa and his newspaper, had luckily no leisure for noticing her; but to the other two her distress was equally visible._<br/>There was no event in life, from a christening to a marriage, but had some appropriate food or drink in my mother's vocabulary, and no ailment for which she had not some pleasant cure in her well-stocked cupboards.

_As soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room; but the housemaids were busy in it, and she was obliged to come down again._<br/>My fellow-lodger had kept her room; and, steeled as my mind was against her influence, I was yet conscious of a little throb of disappointment that she should allow me to depart without a word of farewell.

_She turned into the drawing-room for privacy, but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither, and were at that moment deep in consultation about her._<br/>At this she seemed somewhat hurt, and the tears sprang into her eyes, but she followed me into the sitting-room and watched me wistfully.

_She drew back, trying to beg their pardon, but was, with gentle violence, forced to return; and the others withdrew, after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her._<br/>And she, the polluted one, had risen to the dignity, had cut herself sternly away from all that related to her past life, and had shown signs already of being a great Queen, stronger and wiser than her husband, but fierce, vindictive, and unbending, a firm support to her friends, but a terror to her foes.

_After half an hour's free indulgence of grief and reflection, Catherine felt equal to encountering her friends; but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Perhaps, if particularly questioned, she might just give an idea-- just distantly hint at it-- but not more._<br/>Besides,'' she added, slyly,`` it is just possible that if we did come to the States we might not find you there.''

_To expose a friend, such a friend as Isabella had been to her-- and then their own brother so closely concerned in it!_<br/>Mrs. Harrison loved Jim as if he had been her own son, and her husband loved mine, so they came to my help, and may God bless them for their kindness to a distracted wife and mother!

_She believed she must waive the subject altogether._<br/>She did not withdraw it.

_Henry and Eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast-room; and each, as she entered it, looked at her anxiously._<br/>At this she seemed somewhat hurt, and the tears sprang into her eyes, but she followed me into the sitting-room and watched me wistfully.

_Catherine took her place at the table, and, after a short silence, Eleanor said,`` No bad news from Fullerton, I hope?_<br/>I shall be here in The Wilderness, but all day I shall be by your office table at Throgmorton Street in spirit, and if ever you should be sad you will hear my little whisper in your ear, and know that there is one client whom you will never be able to get rid of-- never as long as we both live, dear.''

_Mr. and Mrs. Morland-- your brothers and sisters-- I hope they are none of them ill?''_<br/>To your father and to your mother, at least, I know that none of them are unfamiliar.

_`` No, I thank you''-LRB- sighing as she spoke-RRB-;`` they are all very well._<br/>`` No one who was not good could be so absolutely happy as she seems to be.

_My letter was from my brother at Oxford.''_<br/>There are my father and mother at Bedford.

_Nothing further was said for a few minutes; and then speaking through her tears, she added,`` I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again!''_<br/>`` No, Mr. Stephens, I've had such a good time all my life, that I do n't think, when I look back, that I ever had any real cause for sorrow.''

_`` I am sorry,'' said Henry, closing the book he had just opened;`` if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome, I should have given it with very different feelings.''_<br/> This is the letter which I read: `` MY EVER DEAREST WIFE,-- `` Since Sir William told me how weak your heart is, and how harmful any shock might be, I have never talked about my business affairs to you.

_`` It contained something worse than anybody could suppose!_<br/>`` No, no, sir, it was worse than that.

_Poor James is so unhappy!_<br/>But you are sad, Jim.''

_You will soon know why.''_<br/>And you will do it soon?''

_`` To have so kind-hearted, so affectionate a sister,'' replied Henry warmly,`` must be a comfort to him under any distress.''_<br/>` Come, Sibylle,' said her father,` you can assure your cousin Louis that, so far as you are concerned, any family misunderstanding is at an end.'

_`` I have one favour to beg,'' said Catherine, shortly afterwards, in an agitated manner,`` that, if your brother should be coming here, you will give me notice of it, that I may go away.''_<br/>`` Well, I forgive you for your desertion, Ambrose,'' said my uncle;`` and,'' he added,`` I should be vastly obliged to you if you would re- arrange my tie.''

_`` Our brother!_<br/>`` My brothers!''

_Frederick!''_<br/>Jim!

_`` Yes; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon, but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney.''_<br/>`` Clara,'' said he, as she came towards him with words of greeting,`` I am sorry to bring ill news to you, but things have gone wrong in the City, and-- and I think that I ought to release you from your engagement.''

_Eleanor's work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment; but Henry began to suspect the truth, and something, in which Miss Thorpe's name was included, passed his lips._<br/>-LSB- Illustration: Do n't miss your grip of it p111-RSB-  Miss Adams felt what it was which he had slipped into her hand, and she looked at him for a moment in bewilderment.

_`` How quick you are!''_<br/>`` Quick, Policles, quick!''

_cried Catherine:`` you have guessed it, I declare!_<br/>she cried,`` what is it that I have done?

_And yet, when we talked about it in Bath, you little thought of its ending so._<br/>Besides, so far as I can see it is not worth discussing, since we ca n't get down, even if we wanted.''

_Isabella-- no wonder now I have not heard from her-- Isabella has deserted my brother, and is to marry yours!_<br/>`` He shall not fall, Walker, and you shall not have occasion to be ashamed of the family into which your daughter is about to marry.

_Could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness, and everything that is bad in the world?''_<br/>It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle, when all else had been overcome.

_`` I hope, so far as concerns my brother, you are misinformed._<br/>`` I promise you that we shall,'' answered my uncle, grimly.

_I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland's disappointment._<br/>I know not whether he had indeed come upon some sudden pit which had engulfed him, or whether in his despair he had cast himself down of set purpose.

_His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable._<br/>I do not intend to marry yet.''

_I think you must be deceived so far._<br/>I feel that we have gone too far already.''

_I am very sorry for Mr. Morland-- sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy; but my surprise would be greater at Frederick's marrying her than at any other part of the story.''_<br/>`` I should be loath to exercise any undue pressure upon my sister Ada; but I have given her to understand that there is no one whom I should prefer for a brother-in-law to my most brilliant scholar, the author of` Some Remarks upon the Bile-Pigments, with special reference to Urobilin.'''

_`` It is very true, however; you shall read James's letter yourself._<br/>` This is what he saith,' I continued, and proceeded to read the very letter which I now read to you.

_Stay-- There is one part--'' recollecting with a blush the last line._<br/>`` We must keep a bold face and brazen it out until the last moment.''

_`` Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother?''_<br/> But there was another reason besides the death of my father and the receipt of this letter from my uncle.

_`` No, read it yourself,'' cried Catherine, whose second thoughts were clearer._<br/>`` No, no, share and share alike,'' he cried.

_`` I do not know what I was thinking of''-LRB- blushing again that she had blushed before-RRB-;`` James only means to give me good advice.''_<br/>I was not aware that it was necessary to ask your permission before smiling at a harmless pleasantry.''

_He gladly received the letter, and, having read it through, with close attention, returned it saying,`` Well, if it is to be so, I can only say that I am sorry for it._<br/>' I am glad to hear you say so,' I answered,` for it makes it easier for me to say that I wish to go my own way, and to have nothing more to do with you.

_Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected._<br/>It was not the first time, my friends, as you are well aware, and you know the reasons that I had to trust that neither nerve nor judgment would ever fail me.

_I do not envy his situation, either as a lover or a son.''_<br/>You need not fear to tell me, dear, for you will find that I am worthy to be loved by such a soldier.

_Miss Tilney, at Catherine's invitation, now read the letter likewise, and, having expressed also her concern and surprise, began to inquire into Miss Thorpe's connections and fortune._<br/>` Faith, Mistress Ruth has taught you to make pretty speeches,' said I,` but methinks she ought to be here amid the beauty of Taunton.'

_`` Her mother is a very good sort of woman,'' was Catherine's answer._<br/>`` And Clara is as bad, Clara who used to be so good and sweet, the very image of her poor mother.

_`` What was her father?''_<br/>`` It was my father!''

_`` A lawyer, I believe._<br/>`` This I tell you as a magistrate.

_They live at Putney.''_<br/>One o'clock at Victoria.''

_`` Are they a wealthy family?''_<br/>` And your noble friends?'

_`` No, not very._<br/>`` No-- certainly not.''

_I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all: but that will not signify in your family._<br/>I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?''

_Your father is so very liberal!_<br/>`` Roddy, darling, here's your father!''

_He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children.''_<br/>He said that he wished to have your promise that they should all have very good reward if they helped you to escape.''

_The brother and sister looked at each other._<br/>Your sister at least knew.''

_`` But,'' said Eleanor, after a short pause,`` would it be to promote his happiness, to enable him to marry such a girl?_<br/>Now that they had not only ceased to protect him, but had themselves become a source of trouble to him, he began to understand how great the blessing was which he had enjoyed, and to sigh for the happy days before his girls had come under the influence of his neighbor.

_She must be an unprincipled one, or she could not have used your brother so._<br/>Your husband's position could not possibly be as hopeless as mine was.''

_And how strange an infatuation on Frederick's side!_<br/>`` But what a strange thing unconsciousness is!

_A girl who, before his eyes, is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man!_<br/>`` Why, what the--'' and she broke into such language as I had never heard from a man's lips before.

_Is not it inconceivable, Henry?_<br/>Is that not true?'

_Frederick too, who always wore his heart so proudly!_<br/>I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!''

_Who found no woman good enough to be loved!''_<br/>`` And no one who has not lived with her and known her intimately can tell how charming and good she is.

_`` That is the most unpromising circumstance, the strongest presumption against him._<br/> Another point which is capable of being used against us is this: The spirits have the greatest difficulty in getting names through to us, and it is this which makes many of their communications so vague and unsatisfactory.

_When I think of his past declarations, I give him up._<br/>When I heard that, I saw my way in the snap of a petronel.'

_Moreover, I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe's prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured._<br/>`` If I may read your life, I would venture to say that you were destined to fulfil the lot of women-- to make some good man happy, and to shed around, in some wider circle, the pleasure which your society has given me since first I knew you.''

_It is all over with Frederick indeed!_<br/>It is all over with Britain.

_He is a deceased man-- defunct in understanding._<br/>He is an old soldier and a most trustworthy man.

_Prepare for your sister-in-law, Eleanor, and such a sister-in-law as you must delight in!_<br/>`` I should wish Ida to be my sister, and you my wife.''

_Open, candid, artless, guileless, with affections strong but simple, forming no pretensions, and knowing no disguise.''_<br/>He, on his part, showed me no ill-will, but met me rather with a coarse joviality, and a rough familiarity which he meant to be ingratiating.

_`` Such a sister-in-law, Henry, I should delight in,'' said Eleanor with a smile._<br/>`` Yes, he looks happy, mother,'' he repeated, with a chuckle.

_`` But perhaps,'' observed Catherine,`` though she has behaved so ill by our family, she may behave better by yours._<br/>''` Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,' she said, and her daughter withdrew.

_Now she has really got the man she likes, she may be constant.''_<br/>I certainly think that she is a woman whom you may very well take as your model.

_`` Indeed I am afraid she will,'' replied Henry;`` I am afraid she will be very constant, unless a baronet should come in her way; that is Frederick's only chance._<br/>`` I am very sorry, Mr. Weld,'' said he,`` but I am afraid that I shall be compelled to dispense with your services.''

_I will get the Bath paper, and look over the arrivals.''_<br/>I return to Southampton to-morrow, and I shall hope to see you in the course of the next week.''

_`` You think it is all for ambition, then?_<br/>`` What is it to me whether you have it now or then?

_And, upon my word, there are some things that seem very like it._<br/>There are some things, you know, which are fine.

_I can not forget that, when she first knew what my father would do for them, she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more._<br/>It was not the first time, my friends, as you are well aware, and you know the reasons that I had to trust that neither nerve nor judgment would ever fail me.

_I never was so deceived in anyone's character in my life before.''_<br/>I have never been so insulted in my life.''

_`` Among all the great variety that you have known and studied.''_<br/>`` Then came the thing that I mind best of all.

_`` My own disappointment and loss in her is very great; but, as for poor James, I suppose he will hardly ever recover it.''_<br/> My fears told me that it might be my own very great discomfiture, but I did not say so.

_`` Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present; but we must not, in our concern for his sufferings, undervalue yours._<br/>`` There is a good reason for that,'' said I,`` for Lord Avon was, as I have heard, your uncle's best friend; and it is but natural that he would not wish to speak of his disgrace.''

_You feel, I suppose, that in losing Isabella, you lose half yourself: you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy._<br/>For my own part, believing as I do that there is nothing of chance in the affairs of this world, I felt that I had been exposed to this trial in order to dispose me to serious thought, and that I had been saved that I might put those thoughts into effect.

_Society is becoming irksome; and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at Bath, the very idea of them without her is abhorrent._<br/>As she could not speak a word of the language, however, and was unable to make any of the delinquents understand what it was that she wanted, her passage up the Nile left the immemorial East very much as she had found it, but afforded a good deal of sympathetic amusement to her fellow-travellers.

_You would not, for instance, now go to a ball for the world._<br/>You would not think it, to look at them.

_You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve, on whose regard you can place dependence, or whose counsel, in any difficulty, you could rely on._<br/>I have no wish to do you any hurt if you will but acknowledge your error, and so set a better example to my household here assembled.''

_You feel all this?''_<br/>What's all this?

_`` No,'' said Catherine, after a few moments' reflection,`` I do not-- ought I?_<br/>`` No,'' said I,`` I do not.''

_To say the truth, though I am hurt and grieved, that I can not still love her, that I am never to hear from her, perhaps never to see her again, I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would have thought.''_<br/>What did it matter to me if she hated the sound of his voice, or if he put every indignity upon her in the hope of breaking her spirit, and spoke to her as he would never have dared to speak to one of his servants?

_`` You feel, as you always do, what is most to the credit of human nature._<br/>`` I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to all of us.

_Such feelings ought to be investigated, that they may know themselves.''_<br/>They may have something to do with it.''

_Catherine, by some chance or other, found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on, though so unaccountably, to mention the circumstance which had produced it._<br/> I was at my wit's ends what to do, whether to be silent, or to tell her of the terrible position in which her lover was placed; but, even as I hesitated, she, with the quick intuition of a woman, read the doubts which were in my mind.

_CHAPTER 26  From this time, the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people; and Catherine found, with some surprise, that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella's want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_Their persuasion that the general would, upon this ground alone, independent of the objection that might be raised against her character, oppose the connection, turned her feelings moreover with some alarm towards herself._<br/>What did it matter to me if she hated the sound of his voice, or if he put every indignity upon her in the hope of breaking her spirit, and spoke to her as he would never have dared to speak to one of his servants?

_She was as insignificant, and perhaps as portionless, as Isabella; and if the heir of the Tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself, at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest?_<br/>`` If it were not for our great ancestors and for our beloved country, the Queen of the Waters,'' said he,`` I could find it in my heart to be glad at this destruction which has come upon this vain and feeble generation.

_The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality, which, as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions, she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the general; and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money, which she had more than once heard him utter, and which tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood by his children._<br/>The less experienced a doctor is, the higher are his notions of professional dignity, as I need not remind you, my young friend, so I was about to refuse the commission with indignation, when I bethought me that, quite apart from medicine, we were gentleman and lady, and that she had asked me to do something for her which was evidently of the greatest possible importance in her eyes.

_They were so fully convinced, however, that their brother would not have the courage to apply in person for his father's consent, and so repeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely to come to Northanger than at the present time, that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney, whenever he made his application, would give his father any just idea of Isabella's conduct, it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was, enabling the general by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion, and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations._<br/>I was not clear that these professions could be made to agree with the speech in which Kenna had promised a hundred hides of land to every man on the ship; but on my making this remark, the three chiefs seemed very surprised and hurt by my suspicions, and explained very plausibly that, as the Britons needed them as a guard, they could not aid them better than by settling on the soil, and so being continually at hand in order to help them.

_She proposed it to him accordingly; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected._<br/>Besides,'' she added, slyly,`` it is just possible that if we did come to the States we might not find you there.''

_`` No,'' said he,`` my father's hands need not be strengthened, and Frederick's confession of folly need not be forestalled._<br/>I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?''

_He must tell his own story.''_<br/>I'll let him take his own way.''

_`` But he will tell only half of it.''_<br/> I could only suggest that he probably wanted it at once.

_`` A quarter would be enough.''_<br/>`` Oh, half that will be ample.

_A day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney._<br/>`` I suppose that since we are all here we may begin at once,'' said Sir Lothian, taking no notice of the other's manner.

_His brother and sister knew not what to think._<br/>Her brother was not a man who permitted mistakes.

_Sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement, and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it._<br/>Perhaps even now, if this strange fanatic would show his sorrow for what he had done, it might be possible to spare him.

_The general, meanwhile, though offended every morning by Frederick's remissness in writing, was free from any real anxiety about him, and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland's time at Northanger pass pleasantly._<br/>He had certainly a strange audience to harangue: his wife perfectly acquiescent and absolutely ignorant of his meaning, Summerlee seated in the shadow, querulous and critical but interested, Lord John lounging in a corner somewhat bored by the whole proceeding, and myself beside the window watching the scene with a kind of detached attention, as if it were all a dream or something in which I had no personal interest whatever.

_He often expressed his uneasiness on this head, feared the sameness of every day's society and employments would disgust her with the place, wished the Lady Frasers had been in the country, talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner, and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood._<br/>He also narrated how a certain field-chaplain Grant, of Desborough's regiment, having after a hot and dusty day drunk sundry flagons of mum, had thereafter sung certain ungodly songs, and danced in a manner unbecoming to his sacred profession.

_But then it was such a dead time of year, no wild-fowl, no game, and the Lady Frasers were not in the country._<br/>But after his death there was no reason why I should not return to the land of my birth, and my desire was the stronger because Eugenie-- the same Eugenie who has been thirty years my wife-- was of the same way of thinking as myself.

_And it all ended, at last, in his telling Henry one morning that when he next went to Woodston, they would take him by surprise there some day or other, and eat their mutton with him._<br/>But when I found that we were actually to sleep out there without covering every night, and that he proposed that our food should be the sheep of the Downs-LRB- wild goats he called them-RRB- cooked upon a fire, which was to be made by the rubbing together of two sticks, my heart failed me, and on the very first night I crept away to my mother.

_Henry was greatly honoured and very happy, and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme._<br/>I am very happy to have been of service.''

_`` And when do you think, sir, I may look forward to this pleasure?_<br/>I should be delighted to come with you, sir, if I can be of any use.''

_I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting, and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days.''_<br/>I return to Southampton to-morrow, and I shall hope to see you in the course of the next week.''

_`` Well, well, we will take our chance some one of those days._<br/>`` Well, well, we must go by averages of course.

_There is no need to fix._<br/>`` There is no time to get any.

_You are not to put yourself at all out of your way._<br/>You are not fit to go out.

_Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough._<br/>If a thing must be done, then take a lead in it, whatever it may be.

_I think I can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor's table._<br/>I think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs.

_Let me see; Monday will be a busy day with you, we will not come on Monday; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me._<br/>`` My fellow-officers, whom I never saw until last night, will not be content unless they catch another glimpse of me the first thing this morning.''

_I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning; and afterwards I can not in decency fail attending the club._<br/>  CHAPTER VII `` To-morrow we Disappear into the Unknown''  I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner, nor will I tell of our week's stay at Para-LRB- save that I should wish to acknowledge the great kindness of the Pereira da Pinta Company in helping us to get together our equipment-RRB-.

_I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now; for, as I am known to be in the country, it would be taken exceedingly amiss; and it is a rule with me, Miss Morland, never to give offence to any of my neighbours, if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it._<br/>I do not speak upon this subject as an amateur, nor, I may add, as a popular lecturer, but I speak as one whose scientific conscience compels him to adhere closely to facts, when I say that Mr. Waldron is very wrong in supposing that because he has never himself seen a so-called prehistoric animal, therefore these creatures no longer exist.

_They are a set of very worthy men._<br/>It is good to be in contact with brave men.

_They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year; and I dine with them whenever I can._<br/>We've been goin' this twenty year, but now we'll draw aside and let our betters get to the front; so if you wish to find what that note means, I can only advise you to do what you are asked, and to drive over to Cliffe Royal, where you will find out.''

_Tuesday, therefore, we may say is out of the question._<br/>Now come on or we shall be late.

_But on Wednesday, I think, Henry, you may expect us; and we shall be with you early, that we may have time to look about us._<br/>I shall let you have a report before evening, but I warn you in advance that you have little to expect.''

_Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston, I suppose; we shall be in the carriage by ten; so, about a quarter before one on Wednesday, you may look for us.''_<br/>I give ye my word that only a week gone last Friday I stopped a grazier coming from Blandford fair, and I took seven hundred guineas off him in these paper cheques, as they call them-- enough, had it been in gold, to have lasted me for a three month rouse.

_A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion, so strong was her desire to be acquainted with Woodston; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry, about an hour afterwards, came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting, and said,`` I am come, young ladies, in a very moralizing strain, to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for, and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage, giving ready-monied actual happiness for a draft on the future, that may not be honoured._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_Witness myself, at this present hour._<br/>I shall be back in an hour.''

_Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday, which bad weather, or twenty other causes, may prevent, I must go away directly, two days before I intended it.''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` Go away!''_<br/>` Shoot away!

_said Catherine, with a very long face._<br/>she asked, with a solemn face.

_`` And why?''_<br/>And why?

_`` Why!_<br/>`` Why!''

_How can you ask the question?_<br/>How could you possibly know?

_Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits, because I must go and prepare a dinner for you, to be sure.''_<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Not seriously!''_<br/>Not a word!

_`` Aye, and sadly too-- for I had much rather stay.''_<br/>` Very likely, but I have not had time to read it.

_`` But how can you think of such a thing, after what the general said?_<br/>`` Well, what do you think of that?''

_When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble, because anything would do.''_<br/>But if it be for you, then it can not be from any one of much importance.''

_Henry only smiled._<br/> O'Brien smiled.

_`` I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister's account and mine._<br/>I am so sorry to cause you any disappointment, and I appreciate most highly the honour which you do me, but what you ask is quite impossible.''

_You must know it to be so; and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary: besides, if he had not said half so much as he did, he has always such an excellent dinner at home, that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify.''_<br/>I told him that out of consideration for our family I should make no public exposure of him, but that he must never again in his life lay his hand upon a card, and that the money which he had won must be returned next morning with an explanation.

_`` I wish I could reason like you, for his sake and my own._<br/> I had thought it was some delusion of my own, but all could see it now.

_Good-bye._<br/>Good-bye.''

_As tomorrow is Sunday, Eleanor, I shall not return.''_<br/>But I must go, Clara, I must not seem to shirk.

_He went; and, it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine to doubt her own judgment than Henry's, she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right, however disagreeable to her his going._<br/> There was nothing which the Emperor loved more than to suddenly produce little scenes of this sort which made everybody very uncomfortable, for no one could tell what awkward or compromising question he was going to put to them next.

_But the inexplicability of the general's conduct dwelt much on her thoughts._<br/>On the contrary, all his attention seemed to be concentrated upon her answer.

_That he was very particular in his eating, she had, by her own unassisted observation, already discovered; but why he should say one thing so positively, and mean another all the while, was most unaccountable!_<br/>She was very good over the matter, but every now and again _ he _ would fetch a hollow groan, and I noticed that he held his right hand just under the sheet all the time, where I had no doubt that it was clasped by her left.

_How were people, at that rate, to be understood?_<br/>How was I to account for that?

_Who but Henry could have been aware of what his father was at?_<br/>But where is your nephew Jim, and how did you come to know that you would be needed?''

_From Saturday to Wednesday, however, they were now to be without Henry._<br/>`` But I may not be here this afternoon.''

_This was the sad finale of every reflection: and Captain Tilney's letter would certainly come in his absence; and Wednesday she was very sure would be wet._<br/>When I thought of the way in which he had spoken of his unhappy friend, Lord Avon, upon the evening before, and of the emotion which he showed as he told the horrible story, I was glad to think that there was the heart of a man there, however much it might please him to conceal it.

_The past, present, and future were all equally in gloom._<br/>Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more.

_Her brother so unhappy, and her loss in Isabella so great; and Eleanor's spirits always affected by Henry's absence!_<br/>My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister.

_What was there to interest or amuse her?_<br/>What had you to do with her or with us?

_She was tired of the woods and the shrubberies-- always so smooth and so dry; and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house._<br/>There was no sound in the woods-- not a leaf moved upon the trees, and all was peace around us-- but we should have been warned by our first experience how cunningly and how patiently these creatures can watch and wait until their chance comes.

_The painful remembrance of the folly it had helped to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from a consideration of the building._<br/>How long its effect may last-- how long mankind may preserve the humility and reverence which this great shock has taught it-- can only be shown by the future.

_What a revolution in her ideas!_<br/>What a foundation for a career!

_She, who had so longed to be in an abbey!_<br/>I wish to goodness she had called me.''

_Now, there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well-connected parsonage, something like Fullerton, but better: Fullerton had its faults, but Woodston probably had none._<br/>He made no advances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him, as it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him to spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance.

_If Wednesday should ever come!_<br/>If it should be so--!''

_It did come, and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for._<br/>`` Yes, if it would end right here one might say so.

_It came-- it was fine-- and Catherine trod on air._<br/>She sprang up the steps and was gone in an instant.

_By ten o'clock, the chaise and four conveyed the two from the abbey; and, after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles, they entered Woodston, a large and populous village, in a situation not unpleasant._<br/> Professor Challenger answered that Mr. Summerlee appeared to be confusing the Amazon with the Thames; that it was in reality a somewhat larger river; that Mr. Summerlee might be interested to know that with the Orinoco, which communicated with it, some fifty thousand miles of country were opened up, and that in so vast a space it was not impossible for one person to find what another had missed.

_Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it, as the general seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country, and the size of the village; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at, and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage, and at all the little chandler's shops which they passed._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_At the further end of the village, and tolerably disengaged from the rest of it, stood the parsonage, a new-built substantial stone house, with its semicircular sweep and green gates; and, as they drove up to the door, Henry, with the friends of his solitude, a large Newfoundland puppy and two or three terriers, was ready to receive and make much of them._<br/>The great green leaves swished slowly above them; they heard the low hum of the Arab talk, and the dull champing of the camels, and then in an instant, by that most mysterious and least understood of miracles, one was in a green Irish valley, and another saw the long straight line of Commonwealth Avenue, and a third was dining at a little round table opposite to the bust of Nelson in the Army and Navy Club, and for him the swishing of the palm branches had been transformed into the long-drawn hum of Pall Mall.

_Catherine's mind was too full, as she entered the house, for her either to observe or to say a great deal; and, till called on by the general for her opinion of it, she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting._<br/> They had left him for an instant and were sitting in the front room, where Norah was preparing tea, when of a sudden they heard a shout that rang through the house.

_Upon looking round it then, she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world; but she was too guarded to say so, and the coldness of her praise disappointed him._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` We are not calling it a good house,'' said he._<br/>`` Your argument is not very good,'' said he.

_`` We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger-- we are considering it as a mere parsonage, small and confined, we allow, but decent, perhaps, and habitable; and altogether not inferior to the generality; or, in other words, I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good._<br/>You are aware that this mansion is one of the oldest in England; but you are not aware that it has been built with a very special eye to concealment, that there are no less than two habitable secret chambers, and that the outer or thicker walls are tunnelled into passages.

_It may admit of improvement, however._<br/>It may be a good change.

_Far be it from me to say otherwise; and anything in reason-- a bow thrown out, perhaps-- though, between ourselves, if there is one thing more than another my aversion, it is a patched-on bow.''_<br/>If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring.

_Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry, at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant, the general was shortly restored to his complacency, and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits._<br/> I could not tell whether it was the wine which he had taken at supper or the excitement of Boy Jim's victory which was affecting Harrison, but his usually placid face wore a most disturbed expression, and his manner seemed to betray an alternation of exultation and embarrassment.

_The room in question was of a commodious, well-proportioned size, and handsomely fitted up as a dining-parlour; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds, she was shown, first into a smaller apartment, belonging peculiarly to the master of the house, and made unusually tidy on the occasion; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing-room, with the appearance of which, though unfurnished, Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general._<br/> He gave me the amused hand-shake and encouraging smile which the head master bestows upon the small boy, and, having greeted the others and helped to collect their bags and their cylinders of oxygen, he stowed us and them away in a large motor-car which was driven by the same impassive Austin, the man of few words, whom I had seen in the character of butler upon the occasion of my first eventful visit to the Professor.

_It was a prettily shaped room, the windows reaching to the ground, and the view from them pleasant, though only over green meadows; and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she felt it._<br/> To every traveller it was a sight of beauty, but to me it was the world-- the great wide free world-- and my heart thrilled and fluttered as the young bird's may when it first hears the whirr of its own flight, and skims along with the blue heaven above it and the green fields beneath.

_`` Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_Why do not you fit up this room, Mr. Tilney?_<br/>But still I do not wish you or Felix to enter that room.

_What a pity not to have it fitted up!_<br/>Do you not think that it is a great pity?'

_It is the prettiest room I ever saw; it is the prettiest room in the world!''_<br/>It just wanted that to make her the most beautiful woman I had ever seen in my life.

_`` I trust,'' said the general, with a most satisfied smile,`` that it will very speedily be furnished: it waits only for a lady's taste!''_<br/>`` Well, I'll take your word without trying,'' said Miss Adams, with a decision which made every one smile.

_`` Well, if it was my house, I should never sit anywhere else._<br/>`` Well if your conscience can stand it--'' `` It has never failed me yet.''

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_What a sweet little cottage there is among the trees-- apple trees, too!_<br/>My word, look at the little birds under the trees!''

_It is the prettiest cottage!''_<br/>`` Oh, that's the prettiest, is it?''

_`` You like it-- you approve it as an object-- it is enough._<br/>`` Then to do good is your object?''

_Henry, remember that Robinson is spoken to about it._<br/>I think I hear them coming, Charles.

_The cottage remains.''_<br/>This cottage is mine.

_Such a compliment recalled all Catherine's consciousness, and silenced her directly; and, though pointedly applied to by the general for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings, nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_The influence of fresh objects and fresh air, however, was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations; and, having reached the ornamental part of the premises, consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow, on which Henry's genius had begun to act about half a year ago, she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure-ground she had ever been in before, though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_A saunter into other meadows, and through part of the village, with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements, and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about, brought them to four o'clock, when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three._<br/>*****  An hour later the shepherd was well on his way to his mountain home, and about the same time the Emperor, having received the Chaplet of Olympia for the incomparable excellence of his performance, was making enquiries with a frowning brow as to who the insolent person might be who had dared to utter such contemptuous criticisms.

_At four they were to dine, and at six to set off on their return._<br/>But we dine at eight, Captain Joyce.

_Never had any day passed so quickly!_<br/>No, I have never heard of it.''

_She could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the general; nay, that he was even looking at the side-table for cold meat which was not there._<br/> I could not tell whether it was the wine which he had taken at supper or the excitement of Boy Jim's victory which was affecting Harrison, but his usually placid face wore a most disturbed expression, and his manner seemed to betray an alternation of exultation and embarrassment.

_His son and daughter's observations were of a different kind._<br/>Her parents were a branch of the de Choiseuls, and their prejudices were even stronger than those of my father.

_They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own, and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter's being oiled._<br/>They were never at their ease, always upon the brink of a catastrophe, encouraged one day only to be rudely rebuffed the next, bullied in public and slighted in private, and yet, in spite of it all, the singular fact remains that they loved him and served him as no monarch has been loved and served.

_At six o'clock, the general having taken his coffee, the carriage again received them; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit, so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations, that, could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son, Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_CHAPTER 27  The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from Isabella:  Bath, April  My dearest Catherine, I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight, and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner._<br/>  CHAPTER VII `` To-morrow we Disappear into the Unknown''  I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner, nor will I tell of our week's stay at Para-LRB- save that I should wish to acknowledge the great kindness of the Pereira da Pinta Company in helping us to get together our equipment-RRB-.

_I really am quite ashamed of my idleness; but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing._<br/>To prevent any painful thoughts, I may assure you once for all, dear, that it is nothing of which I need be ashamed.

_I have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath, but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Pray write to me soon, and direct to my own home._<br/>If I return to my home I do but bring trouble and danger to those whom I love.

_Thank God, we leave this vile place tomorrow._<br/>Good God, it's dreadful to think of!

_Since you went away, I have had no pleasure in it-- the dust is beyond anything; and everybody one cares for is gone._<br/>But he had no hold over me, and there was no reason why _ I _ should stand his insolence, so I came away-- and I very much expect to see you do the same.''

_I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest, for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive._<br/>But I've something to do now which is more in my own line, and I need not trouble you any more.''

_I am quite uneasy about your dear brother, not having heard from him since he went to Oxford; and am fearful of some misunderstanding._<br/>But I had not got half through my story, and Jim, like the good fellow that he was, had just begun to forget his own troubles in his delight at my good fortune, when my uncle called to me from without.

_Your kind offices will set all right: he is the only man I ever did or could love, and I trust you will convince him of it._<br/>The expense of the` special meesion' business hardly justifies the result, and, of course, in any case it would only be an experienced man with a name that would command public confidence who would get such an order.

_The spring fashions are partly down; and the hats the most frightful you can imagine._<br/>Having passed the summit, you will perceive the full extremity of the second cataract, embracing wild natural beauties of the most dreadful variety.

_I hope you spend your time pleasantly, but am afraid you never think of me._<br/>I am so sorry to cause you any disappointment, and I appreciate most highly the honour which you do me, but what you ask is quite impossible.''

_I will not say all that I could of the family you are with, because I would not be ungenerous, or set you against those you esteem; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust, and young men never know their minds two days together._<br/>It was not the first time, my friends, as you are well aware, and you know the reasons that I had to trust that neither nerve nor judgment would ever fail me.

_I rejoice to say that the young man whom, of all others, I particularly abhor, has left Bath._<br/>I hope, madam, by what I have said to the King to-day will satisfy how sincere I am, and how much I detest all those people who have brought me to this.

_You will know, from this description, I must mean Captain Tilney, who, as you may remember, was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me, before you went away._<br/>I see that you look askance at me, Sir Charles Tregellis, but you should pray to God, sir, that you may never have the chance of finding out what you would yourself be capable of in the same position.''

_Afterwards he got worse, and became quite my shadow._<br/>He felt that he had come very badly out of it.

_Many girls might have been taken in, for never were such attentions; but I knew the fickle sex too well._<br/>She and I never took to each other very much; but now I hope all that may be ended, and when I marry she will come and stay with me.''

_He went away to his regiment two days ago, and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again._<br/>He would never trouble me again, and he begged only that I would hand over to him the sum which I held in trust for him.

_He is the greatest coxcomb I ever saw, and amazingly disagreeable._<br/>`` Have I not said that you were the greatest that ever came, and yet behold here is already one who is greater.

_The last two days he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis: I pitied his taste, but took no notice of him._<br/>But after his death there was no reason why I should not return to the land of my birth, and my desire was the stronger because Eugenie-- the same Eugenie who has been thirty years my wife-- was of the same way of thinking as myself.

_The last time we met was in Bath Street, and I turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me; I would not even look at him._<br/>I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time-- as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge-- he could hardly leave at a moment's notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to arrange his affairs.

_He went into the pump-room afterwards; but I would not have followed him for all the world._<br/>I could not see the door by which he had entered, nor could I see him where he stood, but I heard all that he had to say.

_Such a contrast between him and your brother!_<br/>It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.''

_Pray send me some news of the latter-- I am quite unhappy about him; he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away, with a cold, or something that affected his spirits._<br/>When I thought of the way in which he had spoken of his unhappy friend, Lord Avon, upon the evening before, and of the emotion which he showed as he told the horrible story, I was glad to think that there was the heart of a man there, however much it might please him to conceal it.

_I would write to him myself, but have mislaid his direction; and, as I hinted above, am afraid he took something in my conduct amiss._<br/>I had forgotten that he might see me do this through that crack by the hinges, but when I went out again, to show him his way and so get rid of him, my eye caught the gap, and I at once realised that he had seen my action, and that it must have aroused his curiosity to such an extent that it would be quite certain that he would think and speak of it.

_Pray explain everything to his satisfaction; or, if he still harbours any doubt, a line from himself to me, or a call at Putney when next in town, might set all to rights._<br/>If I have been a failure in town, I am none the less conscious of your kindness in trying to advance my interests, and I hope that, should I receive my commission, I may be a credit to you yet.''

_I have not been to the rooms this age, nor to the play, except going in last night with the Hodges, for a frolic, at half price: they teased me into it; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_We happened to sit by the Mitchells, and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out._<br/>When Saxon had ceased to speak I sat as one stunned, trying to realise what he had said to me.

_I knew their spite: at one time they could not be civil to me, but now they are all friendship; but I am not such a fool as to be taken in by them._<br/>But I thought at the time-- and I was not the only one-- that this man's name and work would not be forgotten, and that there would be a curse on the place that had done such a deed.

_You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own._<br/>I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous.

_Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine, as I wore it the week before at the concert, but made wretched work of it-- it happened to become my odd face, I believe, at least Tilney told me so at the time, and said every eye was upon me; but he is the last man whose word I would take._<br/>For some time I was sustained in my scepticism by the consideration that many famous men, such as Darwin himself, Huxley, Tyndall and Herbert Spencer, derided this new branch of knowledge; but when I learned that their derision had reached such a point that they would not even examine it, and that Spencer had declared in so many words that he had decided against it on a priori grounds, while Huxley had said that it did not interest him, I was bound to admit that, however great, they were in science, their action in this respect was most unscientific and dogmatic, while the action of those who studied the phenomena and tried to find out the laws that governed them, was following the true path which has given us all human advance and knowledge.

_I wear nothing but purple now: I know I look hideous in it, but no matter-- it is your dear brother's favourite colour._<br/>`` I should be loath to exercise any undue pressure upon my sister Ada; but I have given her to understand that there is no one whom I should prefer for a brother-in-law to my most brilliant scholar, the author of` Some Remarks upon the Bile-Pigments, with special reference to Urobilin.'''

_Lose no time, my dearest, sweetest Catherine, in writing to him and to me, Who ever am, etc.  Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine._<br/> And, after all, this opening chapter will seem to the reader to have nothing to do with my narrative; and yet there would have been no narrative without it, for it is only when a man goes out into the world with the thought that there are heroisms all round him, and with the desire all alive in his heart to follow any which may come within sight of him, that he breaks away as I did from the life he knows, and ventures forth into the wonderful mystic twilight land where lie the great adventures and the great rewards.

_Its inconsistencies, contradictions, and falsehood struck her from the very first._<br/>it all went to confirm me in my first horrible suspicion, and to turn it into a certainty.

_She was ashamed of Isabella, and ashamed of having ever loved her._<br/>She had forgotten the Emperor, the Empress, everything, in her revulsion of feeling against this craven whom she had loved.

_Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty, and her demands impudent._<br/>I was heart-weary of this empty life, for which I was so ill-fashioned, and weary also of that intolerant talk which would make a coterie of frivolous women and foolish fops the central point of the universe.

_`` Write to James on her behalf!_<br/>Me to revictual her day by day.'''

_No, James should never hear Isabella's name mentioned by her again.''_<br/>No, I have never heard of it.''

_On Henry's arrival from Woodston, she made known to him and Eleanor their brother's safety, congratulating them with sincerity on it, and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation._<br/>`` Come, come, my dear lady,'' said he,`` you speak vastly beyond my merits;'' upon which encouragement she started again in a theatrical apostrophe to Britain's darling and Neptune's eldest son, which he endured with the same signs of gratitude and pleasure.

_When she had finished it--`` So much for Isabella,'' she cried,`` and for all our intimacy!_<br/>`` You see, Clara,'' she cried,`` the charm works already.

_She must think me an idiot, or she could not have written so; but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her._<br/>` You may think me ill-bred to say it, sir,' she remarked,` but I can not but marvel where you have been, or what you have done all your life.

_I see what she has been about._<br/>I want you to see what I have seen.''

_She is a vain coquette, and her tricks have not answered._<br/>Sibylle is a charming girl, and you must not allow yourself to be prejudiced against her by any ill temper which she may have shown towards me.

_I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me, and I wish I had never known her.''_<br/>I do not know why they should be so coupled, and they never were with Jim.

_`` It will soon be as if you never had,'' said Henry._<br/>`` And as far as I can help,'' said Harvey Deacon,`` it will certainly never be done again.''

_`` There is but one thing that I can not understand._<br/>`` Yes, yes; I admit I can not explain them.''

_I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney, which have not succeeded; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time._<br/>I felt that if I did not discharge my pistol Lord Dacre's honour might feel hurt, and yet it was quite impossible for me, after hearing what this lady has said, to aim it at her husband.

_Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother, and then fly off himself?''_<br/>Anyhow, it is absurd to suppose that because a murderer chooses to fly from justice--'' `` I wo n't have you use that word, Sir Lothian,'' cried my uncle, sharply.

_`` I have very little to say for Frederick's motives, such as I believe them to have been._<br/>`` I have little more to say, and it's as well, for I am about done up.

_He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe, and the chief difference is, that, having a stronger head, they have not yet injured himself._<br/>As to his brightness, it really does not matter, for his aunt, Mrs. Westmacott, is very rich, much richer than you would think from her style of living, and she has made him a handsome provision.''

_If the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you, we had better not seek after the cause.''_<br/>If he does not tak them t' others will, so we had raither that they go to the good cause.

_`` Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her?''_<br/> I knew that it was not so, but how could I bring myself to tell her?

_`` I am persuaded that he never did.''_<br/>`` I am sure that he would not.''

_`` And only made believe to do so for mischief's sake?''_<br/>`` For God's sake come at once!

_Henry bowed his assent._<br/> John Ferrier bowed coldly.

_`` Well, then, I must say that I do not like him at all._<br/>`` Well, I must say that I do not admire the result.

_Though it has turned out so well for us, I do not like him at all._<br/>He said that he could not very well understand you, nor you him, and so he came to me.''

_As it happens, there is no great harm done, because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose._<br/>However, there is no great harm done, and it will not seriously disarrange my plans.

_But, suppose he had made her very much in love with him?''_<br/>He is very much in love with her, I assure you.

_`` But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose-- consequently to have been a very different creature; and, in that case, she would have met with very different treatment.''_<br/> And yet somehow the possibility and even the probability of it had occurred to me from the beginning, and I believe that it had to Harrison also, for I had noticed that his face grew grave and troubled from the very moment that there was talk of the stranger below.

_`` It is very right that you should stand by your brother.''_<br/>`` Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must be a most extraordinary one.''

_`` And if you would stand by yours, you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe._<br/> But I must warn you also that, if you think you will find much that is of interest in your guide, you are destined to disappointment.

_But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity, and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality, or a desire of revenge.''_<br/>Also, how he had afterwards explained that such backslidings were not to be regarded us faults of the individual, but rather as actual obsessions of the evil one, who contrived in this manner to give scandal to the faithful, and selected the most godly for his evil purpose.

_Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness._<br/>`` I do believe that you are all the time enjoying it, Mr. Stephens,'' said Sadie, with some bitterness.

_Frederick could not be unpardonably guilty, while Henry made himself so agreeable._<br/>There was scarcely a fault which a General could commit which Feversham had not been guilty of.

_She resolved on not answering Isabella's letter, and tried to think no more of it._<br/>She stopped herself with an effort, and spoke no more upon the subject.

_CHAPTER 28  Soon after this, the general found himself obliged to go to London for a week; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity should rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland's company, and anxiously recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children as their chief object in his absence._<br/> Having got so far, Defoe remarked that he thought he had given them a fair start, and handed over the story to Dean Swift, who, after premising that he feared he would find himself as much at sea as Master Cyprian Overbeck Wells, continued in this way:-- `` For two days I drifted about in great distress, fearing that there should be a return of the gale, and keeping an eager look-out for my late companions.

_His departure gave Catherine the first experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain._<br/>For my own part I was relieved at the explanation, for my father had left London in the full conviction that a vacancy would speedily be found for us both, and the one thing which had weighed upon my mind was that I might have found it hard to leave my uncle without interfering with the plans which he had formed.

_The happiness with which their time now passed, every employment voluntary, every laugh indulged, every meal a scene of ease and good humour, walking where they liked and when they liked, their hours, pleasures, and fatigues at their own command, made her thoroughly sensible of the restraint which the general's presence had imposed, and most thankfully feel their present release from it._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Such ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more every day; and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one, and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other, she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy; but she was now in the fourth week of her visit; before the general came home, the fourth week would be turned, and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_This was a painful consideration whenever it occurred; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind, she very soon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once, propose going away, and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might be taken._<br/>I had forgotten that he might see me do this through that crack by the hinges, but when I went out again, to show him his way and so get rid of him, my eye caught the gap, and I at once realised that he had seen my action, and that it must have aroused his curiosity to such an extent that it would be quite certain that he would think and speak of it.

_Aware that if she gave herself much time, she might feel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject, she took the first opportunity of being suddenly alone with Eleanor, and of Eleanor's being in the middle of a speech about something very different, to start forth her obligation of going away very soon._<br/> I was at my wit's ends what to do, whether to be silent, or to tell her of the terrible position in which her lover was placed; but, even as I hesitated, she, with the quick intuition of a woman, read the doubts which were in my mind.

_Eleanor looked and declared herself much concerned._<br/>she asked, coolly enough.

_She had`` hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time-- had been misled-LRB- perhaps by her wishes-RRB- to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised-- and could not but think that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there, they would be too generous to hasten her return.''_<br/>Now that they had not only ceased to protect him, but had themselves become a source of trouble to him, he began to understand how great the blessing was which he had enjoyed, and to sigh for the happy days before his girls had come under the influence of his neighbor.

_Catherine explained:`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh, Monica!''

_As to that, Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all._<br/>It is my belief that she is merely stunned, and that she is in no danger at all.''

_As long as she was happy, they would always be satisfied.''_<br/>For as long as we can see it, how can we be truly happy?''

_`` Then why, might she ask, in such a hurry herself to leave them?''_<br/>`` But why should you leave her?''

_`` Oh!_<br/>`` Oh!

_Because she had been there so long.''_<br/>It had really been so, then.

_`` Nay, if you can use such a word, I can urge you no farther._<br/>`` I can not understand, then, how you can say that there is no such danger.

_If you think it long--'' `` Oh!_<br/>`` So how long do you think it took you?''

_No, I do not indeed._<br/>No, I could n't possibly.

_For my own pleasure, I could stay with you as long again.''_<br/>For as long as we can see it, how can we be truly happy?''

_And it was directly settled that, till she had, her leaving them was not even to be thought of._<br/>It was evident that she had seen my exit, but had not observed my return.

_In having this cause of uneasiness so pleasantly removed, the force of the other was likewise weakened._<br/>In short, the higher is palpably gone, and the lower, the sense of fear, of sensual impression, of self-preservation, is functioning all the more vividly because it is relieved from the higher control.

_The kindness, the earnestness of Eleanor's manner in pressing her to stay, and Henry's gratified look on being told that her stay was determined, were such sweet proofs of her importance with them, as left her only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably without._<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_She did-- almost always-- believe that Henry loved her, and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them; and believing so far, her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive irritations._<br/>Mrs. Harrison loved Jim as if he had been her own son, and her husband loved mine, so they came to my help, and may God bless them for their kindness to a distracted wife and mother!

_Henry was not able to obey his father's injunction of remaining wholly at Northanger in attendance on the ladies, during his absence in London, the engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave them on Saturday for a couple of nights._<br/>`` I am sure, Monsieur Fardet,'' said Mrs. Belmont,`` that you, who are a Frenchman, and therefore a man of gallantry and honour, would not permit your own wounded feelings to interfere with the fulfilment of your promise and your duty towards three helpless ladies.''

_His loss was not now what it had been while the general was at home; it lessened their gaiety, but did not ruin their comfort; and the two girls agreeing in occupation, and improving in intimacy, found themselves so well sufficient for the time to themselves, that it was eleven o'clock, rather a late hour at the abbey, before they quitted the supper-room on the day of Henry's departure._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed, as far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge, that a carriage was driving up to the door, and the next moment confirmed the idea by the loud noise of the house-bell._<br/>But when once we were on the road I could tell by the drumming of their hoofs how far distant they were, and it seemed to me that the sound grew perceptibly louder, as if they were slowly gaining upon me.

_After the first perturbation of surprise had passed away, in a`` Good heaven!_<br/>A second time it appeared before I reached the cottage, and there was something in the stealthy manner in which it peeped and whisked away, and peeped once more, which filled me with surprise, and with a certain vague apprehension.

_What can be the matter?''_<br/>`` What is the matter?

_it was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her eldest brother, whose arrival was often as sudden, if not quite so unseasonable, and accordingly she hurried down to welcome him._<br/>At the time there were reasons, now happily long gone past, which made me determine that the son was better apart from the mother, whose absence at that age he would not miss.

_Catherine walked on to her chamber, making up her mind as well as she could, to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney, and comforting herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her, and the persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of her, that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_She trusted he would never speak of Miss Thorpe; and indeed, as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted, there could be no danger of it; and as long as all mention of Bath scenes were avoided, she thought she could behave to him very civilly._<br/>As she could not speak a word of the language, however, and was unable to make any of the delinquents understand what it was that she wanted, her passage up the Nile left the immemorial East very much as she had found it, but afforded a good deal of sympathetic amusement to her fellow-travellers.

_In such considerations time passed away, and it was certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him, and have so much to say, for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival, and Eleanor did not come up._<br/>At the time there were reasons, now happily long gone past, which made me determine that the son was better apart from the mother, whose absence at that age he would not miss.

_At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery, and listened for its continuance; but all was silent._<br/> I was at my wit's ends what to do, whether to be silent, or to tell her of the terrible position in which her lover was placed; but, even as I hesitated, she, with the quick intuition of a woman, read the doubts which were in my mind.

_Scarcely, however, had she convicted her fancy of error, when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start; it seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway-- and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_She trembled a little at the idea of anyone's approaching so cautiously; but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm, or misled by a raised imagination, she stepped quietly forward, and opened the door._<br/> She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her.

_Eleanor, and only Eleanor, stood there._<br/>You still stand between me and Sophie.

_Catherine's spirits, however, were tranquillized but for an instant, for Eleanor's cheeks were pale, and her manner greatly agitated._<br/>Her face was pale, striking rather than pretty, but with two great dark eyes, so earnestly questioning, so quick in their transitions from joy to pathos, so swift in their comment upon every word and deed around her, that those eyes alone were to many more attractive than all the beauty of her younger sister.

_Though evidently intending to come in, it seemed an effort to enter the room, and a still greater to speak when there._<br/>You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require.

_Catherine, supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney's account, could only express her concern by silent attention, obliged her to be seated, rubbed her temples with lavender-water, and hung over her with affectionate solicitude._<br/>He had certainly a strange audience to harangue: his wife perfectly acquiescent and absolutely ignorant of his meaning, Summerlee seated in the shadow, querulous and critical but interested, Lord John lounging in a corner somewhat bored by the whole proceeding, and myself beside the window watching the scene with a kind of detached attention, as if it were all a dream or something in which I had no personal interest whatever.

_`` My dear Catherine, you must not-- you must not indeed--'' were Eleanor's first connected words._<br/>`` Your dear mother would not have liked it, Clara,'' said he.

_`` I am quite well._<br/>I am so pleased.

_This kindness distracts me-- I can not bear it-- I come to you on such an errand!''_<br/>Well, sir, let us do what we can to curtail this visit, which can hardly be agreeable to you, and is inexpressibly irksome to me.

_`` Errand!_<br/>`` Goodness!

_To me!''_<br/>To me!''

_`` How shall I tell you!_<br/>`` Shall I tell you?''

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_How shall I tell you!''_<br/>What shall I do?

_A new idea now darted into Catherine's mind, and turning as pale as her friend, she exclaimed,'''T is a messenger from Woodston!''_<br/>`` Au revoir,'' said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away.

_`` You are mistaken, indeed,'' returned Eleanor, looking at her most compassionately;`` it is no one from Woodston._<br/>`` There is no use deceiving ourselves, Mrs. Belmont,'' said he;`` we may as well face the truth.

_It is my father himself.''_<br/>My father was his only son.

_Her voice faltered, and her eyes were turned to the ground as she mentioned his name._<br/>Her voice had fallen suddenly to a quivering whisper and she was pointing to the Westmacotts' house.

_His unlooked-for return was enough in itself to make Catherine's heart sink, and for a few moments she hardly supposed there were anything worse to be told._<br/>A second question from us failed to elicit any answer at all, save a plaintive bleat from his wife to the effect that her husband was in a very violent temper already, and that she hoped we would do nothing to make it worse.

_She said nothing; and Eleanor, endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness, but with eyes still cast down, soon went on._<br/>She and I never took to each other very much; but now I hope all that may be ended, and when I marry she will come and stay with me.''

_`` You are too good, I am sure, to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform._<br/>`` You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.''

_I am indeed a most unwilling messenger._<br/>`` I am sure I am very sorry if I have asked a foolish question.

_After what has so lately passed, so lately been settled between us-- how joyfully, how thankfully on my side!_<br/>I learned that Parmes had seen her before I did, and had shown her that he too loved her, but I could smile at his passion, for I knew that her heart was mine.

_-- as to your continuing here as I hoped for many, many weeks longer, how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted-- and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by-- But I must not trust myself with words._<br/>When he spoke of seeing her again so soon, he was referring to her own approaching death, which he had been assured could not be delayed more than a very few months.

_My dear Catherine, we are to part._<br/>Oh dear, here he is!

_My father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on Monday._<br/>My father's good wishes had been won by his piety and by the sacrifices which he claimed to have made for the faith.

_We are going to Lord Longtown's, near Hereford, for a fortnight._<br/>We are to have a week for plundering the town, and then one army corps is to take possession of Scotland and another of Ireland.'

_Explanation and apology are equally impossible._<br/>That however is surely impossible.

_I can not attempt either.''_<br/>I could not-- must not-- fail.

_`` My dear Eleanor,'' cried Catherine, suppressing her feelings as well as she could,`` do not be so distressed._<br/>`` My dear Mrs. Westmacott,'' cried Clara,`` I assure you that I have not the least idea what it is that you are talking of.''

_A second engagement must give way to a first._<br/>One must give way to the other.

_I am very, very sorry we are to part-- so soon, and so suddenly too; but I am not offended, indeed I am not._<br/>I am so sorry to cause you any disappointment, and I appreciate most highly the honour which you do me, but what you ask is quite impossible.''

_I can finish my visit here, you know, at any time; or I hope you will come to me._<br/>`` If you will let me know how your investigations go,'' he continued,`` I shall be happy to give you any help I can.

_Can you, when you return from this lord's, come to Fullerton?''_<br/>`` Can you tell me if Mr. Brewster lives here?''

_`` It will not be in my power, Catherine.''_<br/>`` Yes, and I can not be sure when he will be back.

_`` Come when you can, then.''_<br/>`` Come, then!

_Eleanor made no answer; and Catherine's thoughts recurring to something more directly interesting, she added, thinking aloud,`` Monday-- so soon as Monday; and you all go._<br/> She raised no objection, and for my part I was overjoyed at the proposal, as it gave me an opportunity of learning more of this singular cousin of mine, who had told me so much and yet seemed to know so much more.

_Well, I am certain of-- I shall be able to take leave, however._<br/>`` But I am quite certain that I would not leave you here.''

_I need not go till just before you do, you know._<br/>`` And yet I agree with you that we can not go back until we have tried.''

_Do not be distressed, Eleanor, I can go on Monday very well._<br/>You are not as aggressive as I should wish, Clara, but still I like you very much.

_My father and mother's having no notice of it is of very little consequence._<br/>My father, however, had either never heard of it, or had forgotten the circumstance.

_The general will send a servant with me, I dare say, half the way-- and then I shall soon be at Salisbury, and then I am only nine miles from home.''_<br/>` It is but six miles to Amesbury, where at the Cecil Arms ye shall find, I doubt not, all that is needful for man and for beast.'

_`` Ah, Catherine!_<br/>`` Ah, yes!''

_Were it settled so, it would be somewhat less intolerable, though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought._<br/>Still, I should have thought that you might have found a more probable one, and one which would entail less serious consequences.''

_But-- how can I tell you?_<br/>And then... And then... how can I tell you what happened then?

_-- tomorrow morning is fixed for your leaving us, and not even the hour is left to your choice; the very carriage is ordered, and will be here at seven o'clock, and no servant will be offered you.''_<br/>I would ask you to give your parole that you will remain in this dwelling for twenty-four hours, and take no steps to inform anyone of our movements.''

_Catherine sat down, breathless and speechless._<br/> We stood listening in breathless silence.

_`` I could hardly believe my senses, when I heard it; and no displeasure, no resentment that you can feel at this moment, however justly great, can be more than I myself-- but I must not talk of what I felt._<br/>I do n't whine about what I have deserved, and so far I have had no more than I have deserved.

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_That I could suggest anything in extenuation!_<br/>Shall I say anything to him?''

_Good God!_<br/>Good Lord!

_What will your father and mother say!_<br/>What would your father say?

_After courting you from the protection of real friends to this-- almost double distance from your home, to have you driven out of the house, without the considerations even of decent civility!_<br/>Or once again, if Raymond can tell us of a photograph no copy of which had reached England, and which proved to be exactly as he described it, and if he can give us, through the lips of strangers, all sorts of details of his home life, which his own relatives had to verify before they found them to be true, is it unreasonable to suppose that he is fairly accurate in his description of his own experiences and state of life at the very moment at which he is communicating?

_Dear, dear Catherine, in being the bearer of such a message, I seem guilty myself of all its insult; yet, I trust you will acquit me, for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it, that my real power is nothing.''_<br/> I could have explained that it was because he had betrayed his comrades, because his daughter hated him, because he had ill-used his wife, because my father regarded him as the source of all his troubles-- but the salon of the Empress was no place for a family quarrel, so I merely shrugged my shoulders, and was silent.

_`` Have I offended the general?''_<br/>`` I hate the place.

_said Catherine in a faltering voice._<br/>cried Reuben, in a faltering voice.

_`` Alas!_<br/> Alas!

_For my feelings as a daughter, all that I know, all that I answer for, is that you can have given him no just cause of offence._<br/>` Now, sir,' she continued,' I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative.

_He certainly is greatly, very greatly discomposed; I have seldom seen him more so._<br/>I confess that I have seldom known a case which at first sight presented a more singular problem.''

_His temper is not happy, and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree; some disappointment, some vexation, which just at this moment seems important, but which I can hardly suppose you to have any concern in, for how is it possible?''_<br/>It is no pleasant matter for me to dwell upon, yet, convinced as I am that there is no such thing as chance either in the great or the little things of this world, I am very sure that the sacrifices of these brave men were not thrown away, and that their strivings were not as profitless as might at first sight appear.

_It was with pain that Catherine could speak at all; and it was only for Eleanor's sake that she attempted it._<br/> Everything which the girl said seemed to be meant as an insult to me, and yet I could not imagine how I had ever offended her.

_`` I am sure,'' said she,`` I am very sorry if I have offended him._<br/>`` I am sure I am very sorry if I have asked a foolish question.

_It was the last thing I would willingly have done._<br/>As it proved, it was the very best thing that he could have done.

_But do not be unhappy, Eleanor._<br/>`` Do not be angry with us.

_An engagement, you know, must be kept._<br/>` You say that an example must be made.

_I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner, that I might have written home._<br/>I confess that at the beginning I did not tell him what I had seen, and my excuse must be that he disappeared before I had time to determine what I should do.

_But it is of very little consequence.''_<br/>But this is too much.

_`` I hope, I earnestly hope, that to your real safety it will be of none; but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence: to comfort, appearance, propriety, to your family, to the world._<br/>`` You know,'' I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so much of Holmes's heart before,`` that it is my greatest joy and privilege to help you.''

_Were your friends, the Allens, still in Bath, you might go to them with comparative ease; a few hours would take you there; but a journey of seventy miles, to be taken post by you, at your age, alone, unattended!''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_`` Oh, the journey is nothing._<br/>`` Oh, nothing.

_Do not think about that._<br/>Do you not think that it is over-accentuated?

_And if we are to part, a few hours sooner or later, you know, makes no difference._<br/>When we do, ma'am, there's no one we would look to sooner than to you.''

_I can be ready by seven._<br/>Get your things on, and I'll be ready at the door by ten o'clock.''

_Let me be called in time.''_<br/>Let it be daturon.

_Eleanor saw that she wished to be alone; and believing it better for each that they should avoid any further conversation, now left her with,`` I shall see you in the morning.''_<br/>She could wish nothing better than that Ida should be the wife of Harold Denver, and from the words which she had overheard as they left the lawn that evening, she could not doubt that there was some understanding between them.

_Catherine's swelling heart needed relief._<br/> Ida gave a sigh of relief.

_In Eleanor's presence friendship and pride had equally restrained her tears, but no sooner was she gone than they burst forth in torrents._<br/>Her voice was full of tears, and what she said was so simple, so true, that we both seemed to see the dead babe stretched there on the carpet before us, and we could have joined in with words of pity and of grief.

_Turned from the house, and in such a way!_<br/>It came from the door of the house.

_Without any reason that could justify, any apology that could atone for the abruptness, the rudeness, nay, the insolence of it._<br/>To prevent any painful thoughts, I may assure you once for all, dear, that it is nothing of which I need be ashamed.

_Henry at a distance-- not able even to bid him farewell._<br/>`` Ah, Gerard,'' said he one evening-- but it is not for me to repeat the words.

_Every hope, every expectation from him suspended, at least, and who could say how long?_<br/>If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings.

_Who could say when they might meet again?_<br/>Who could have expected it?'

_And all this by such a man as General Tilney, so polite, so well bred, and heretofore so particularly fond of her!_<br/>For the rest, he was an excellent man of business, fair and even generous in his dealings, respected by all and loved by few, for his nature was too self-contained to admit of much affection.

_It was as incomprehensible as it was mortifying and grievous._<br/>It is inconceivable and horrible.

_From what it could arise, and where it would end, were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm._<br/>Had I seen you before the thing was done, I might have put it beyond your power to oppose me or to raise an alarm.

_The manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil, hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience, or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling; of two days, the earliest fixed on, and of that almost the earliest hour, as if resolved to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning, that he might not be obliged even to see her._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_What could all this mean but an intentional affront?_<br/>What else could it point to?

_By some means or other she must have had the misfortune to offend him._<br/>I will confess that she had some reason to be annoyed at the turn which things had taken.

_Eleanor had wished to spare her from so painful a notion, but Catherine could not believe it possible that any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person not connected, or, at least, not supposed to be connected with it._<br/>I would have taken you into my confidence, Charles, had it not been that your suspicions had wounded me deeply-- for I did not at that time understand how strong the reasons were which had prejudiced you against me.

_Heavily passed the night._<br/>`` It was last night.

_Sleep, or repose that deserved the name of sleep, was out of the question._<br/>But the long night had to be passed somehow, and for me at least, sleep seemed to be out of the question.

_That room, in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival, was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers._<br/>It chanced, however, that the unhappy sheep, which was quietly engaged in sleeping off the effects of its unusual potations, was awakened by the noise of his approach, and finding herself in such an unusual position, sprang out of bed and rushed furiously for the door, bleating wildly, and rolling about like a brig in a tornado, partly from intoxication and partly from the night-dress which impeded her movements.

_Yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then-- how mournfully superior in reality and substance!_<br/>And yet, though I read a mutual love in their glances, I read also mutual horror, and recognised in her face some reflection of that stealthy fear which I had detected in his.

_Her anxiety had foundation in fact, her fears in probability; and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil, the solitude of her situation, the darkness of her chamber, the antiquity of the building, were felt and considered without the smallest emotion; and though the wind was high, and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house, she heard it all as she lay awake, hour after hour, without curiosity or terror._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_Soon after six Eleanor entered her room, eager to show attention or give assistance where it was possible; but very little remained to be done._<br/>  VI  THE SEALED ROOM  A solicitor of an active habit and athletic tastes who is compelled by his hopes of business to remain within the four walls of his office from ten till five must take what exercise he can in the evenings.

_Catherine had not loitered; she was almost dressed, and her packing almost finished._<br/>He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start.

_The possibility of some conciliatory message from the general occurred to her as his daughter appeared._<br/>In one case the first message to the mother came through a stranger to whom the correct address of the mother was given.

_What so natural, as that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it?_<br/>Why, then, should we risk so many evils to bring that about which time and patience must, perforce, accomplish between them?

_And she only wanted to know how far, after what had passed, an apology might properly be received by her._<br/>said she; and was gone ere I could say a word in answer to her extraordinary request.

_But the knowledge would have been useless here; it was not called for; neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial-- Eleanor brought no message._<br/>If I have not said much about it before, it was, of course, that the Professor's earnest desire was that no possible rumor of the unanswerable argument which we carried should be allowed to leak out until the moment came when his enemies were to be confuted.

_Very little passed between them on meeting; each found her greatest safety in silence, and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs, Catherine in busy agitation completing her dress, and Eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_When everything was done they left the room, Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well-known, cherished object, and went down to the breakfast-parlour, where breakfast was prepared._<br/>As he had withdrawn his head, however, entirely beneath the bedclothes, there was nothing more to be said, so I descended to the lower room, where I found toy father busily engaged fastening a new buckle to his sword-belt while my mother and the maid were preparing the morning meal.

_She tried to eat, as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable; but she had no appetite, and could not swallow many mouthfuls._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_The contrast between this and her last breakfast in that room gave her fresh misery, and strengthened her distaste for everything before her._<br/>Twice during our meal she rose from her chair and withdrew into a cupboard at the end of the room, and each time I saw Jim's face cloud, for we heard a gentle clink of glass against glass.

_It was not four and twenty hours ago since they had met there to the same repast, but in circumstances how different!_<br/>It is not for nothing that I expended an hour last night in focusing my mind upon the situation.

_With what cheerful ease, what happy, though false, security, had she then looked around her, enjoying everything present, and fearing little in future, beyond Henry's going to Woodston for a day!_<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_Happy, happy breakfast!_<br/>`` Ah, here is breakfast at last!''

_For Henry had been there; Henry had sat by her and helped her._<br/>She felt that it was settled, that he had come to ask her for her sister's hand.

_These reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion, who sat as deep in thought as herself; and the appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall them to the present moment._<br/>He had certainly a strange audience to harangue: his wife perfectly acquiescent and absolutely ignorant of his meaning, Summerlee seated in the shadow, querulous and critical but interested, Lord John lounging in a corner somewhat bored by the whole proceeding, and myself beside the window watching the scene with a kind of detached attention, as if it were all a dream or something in which I had no personal interest whatever.

_Catherine's colour rose at the sight of it; and the indignity with which she was treated, striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force, made her for a short time sensible only of resentment._<br/>Her face was pale, striking rather than pretty, but with two great dark eyes, so earnestly questioning, so quick in their transitions from joy to pathos, so swift in their comment upon every word and deed around her, that those eyes alone were to many more attractive than all the beauty of her younger sister.

_Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech._<br/>But new considerations have at last compelled me to alter my resolution.

_`` You must write to me, Catherine,'' she cried;`` you must let me hear from you as soon as possible._<br/>' I will know here and now,' she cried.

_Till I know you to be safe at home, I shall not have an hour's comfort._<br/>`` I think that we had better tell Mary that we are not at home.''

_For one letter, at all risks, all hazards, I must entreat._<br/>All that I know I shall endeavour soberly and in due order to put before you.

_Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton, and have found your family well, and then, till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do, I will not expect more._<br/>I confess to you that I can not imagine anything more convenient than that we should unite in order to settle once for all every question as to which branch of the family shall hold the estates.'

_Direct to me at Lord Longtown's, and, I must ask it, under cover to Alice.''_<br/>He had himself been appointed to the Cato, 64, with post rank, whilst a note had come from Lord Nelson at Portsmouth to say that a vacancy was open for me if I should present myself at once.

_`` No, Eleanor, if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me, I am sure I had better not write._<br/>`` I will tell you about him-- or a little about him, for he has done much which I would not care to talk of, nor you to listen to.

_There can be no doubt of my getting home safe.''_<br/>There was no hope for my mission now, and I had done all that I could do.

_Eleanor only replied,`` I can not wonder at your feelings._<br/>' I understand that it did not really represent your Grace's thoughts.'

_I will not importune you._<br/>You will not refuse me?''

_I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you.''_<br/>I trust that if we can ensure an atmosphere hyper-oxygenated to a certain point, we may be able to retain our senses.

_But this, with the look of sorrow accompanying it, was enough to melt Catherine's pride in a moment, and she instantly said,`` Oh, Eleanor, I will write to you indeed.''_<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_There was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle, though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of._<br/> It seemed to me that he was only too anxious to remove me at once from the influence of this extraordinary colleague, and I was glad to go, for the conversation had become embarrassing.

_It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home, Catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey, and, upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation, it proved to be exactly the case._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment, but, upon examining her purse, was convinced that but for this kindness of her friend, she might have been turned from the house without even the means of getting home; and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both, scarcely another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Short, however, was that time._<br/>Yes, it was indeed so.

_The carriage was soon announced to be ready; and Catherine, instantly rising, a long and affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu; and, as they entered the hall, unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either, she paused a moment, and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left`` her kind remembrance for her absent friend.''_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_But with this approach to his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings; and, hiding her face as well as she could with her handkerchief, she darted across the hall, jumped into the chaise, and in a moment was driven from the door._<br/>There was something in the gentleness of his rebuke, and in his appeal to her mother, which brought the tears to her eyes, and in another instant she would have been kneeling beside him with everything confessed, when the door flew open and her sister Ida came bounding into the room.

_CHAPTER 29  Catherine was too wretched to be fearful._<br/>`` Oh, when I _ am _ miserable I am just too miserable for words.

_The journey in itself had no terrors for her; and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness._<br/>I wish her every success, for we have no reason at all to fear this miserable poet, while the other is formidable.

_Leaning back in one corner of the carriage, in a violent burst of tears, she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head; and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it._<br/>There we left him then in the dim-lit London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow and most artificial woman, while without, at the edge of the Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with it, his victory, which confined Napoleon's ambition for ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.

_Unfortunately, the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from Woodston; and, for fourteen miles, every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Every mile, as it brought her nearer Woodston, added to her sufferings, and when within the distance of five, she passed the turning which led to it, and thought of Henry, so near, yet so unconscious, her grief and agitation were excessive._<br/>I give you my word that when I went to London last fall the sight of an overworked, raw-backed cart-horse straining with its load, and flogged for not doing that which it could not do, gave me greater qualms than did the field of Sedgemoor, or that greater day when ten thousand of the flower of France lay stretched before the earthworks of Landen.

_The day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest of her life._<br/>`` Yes,'' she said at last,`` I had a feeling that there was something on his mind.''

_It was there, it was on that day, that the general had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself, had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage._<br/>He would talk, too, to his two daughters of her strength of character, her decisive mind, and of the necessity of their cultivating her acquaintance and following her example, until at last it had become his most common topic of conversation.

_Yes, only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard-- had he even confused her by his too significant reference!_<br/>What did I do ten months ago which inspired you with such a particular affection for me?

_And now-- what had she done, or what had she omitted to do, to merit such a change?_<br/>said she; and was gone ere I could say a word in answer to her extraordinary request.

_The only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge._<br/> I think that it may have been his purpose-- for he never did anything without a purpose-- to give me an object-lesson of his own capacity for governing, with the idea, perhaps, that I might in turn influence others of the Emigres by what I told them.

_Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each._<br/>From his wife to his groom there was not one of those who were about him who did not live in dread of being held up to ridicule and infamy before a smiling crowd, whose amusement was only tempered by the reflection that each of them might be the next to endure the same exposure.

_Designedly, at least, Henry could not have betrayed her._<br/>I did not know that he belonged to these horrible people, or I should not have admitted him.

_If, indeed, by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for, of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations, she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation._<br/>Never for an hour had she given him cause to regret it; but this lawyer brother of hers had, as I understood, offended my father by his slavish obsequiousness in days of prosperity and his venomous enmity in the days of trouble.

_If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer, she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house._<br/>If I had not penetrated her secret I should often have thought that she forgot even that I was in the house.

_But a justification so full of torture to herself, she trusted, would not be in his power._<br/>Was it not obvious that he or she would feel bound to return some result for money received, and that the temptation to fraud would be an overpowering one?

_Anxious as were all her conjectures on this point, it was not, however, the one on which she dwelt most._<br/>`` Why, I can not say that, but she seemed very set upon it, and women have their fancies.

_There was a thought yet nearer, a more prevailing, more impetuous concern._<br/>It is not altogether a favourable case, but still it might be much worse.

_How Henry would think, and feel, and look, when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her being gone, was a question of force and interest to rise over every other, to be never ceasing, alternately irritating and soothing; it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence, and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_To the general, of course, he would not dare to speak; but to Eleanor-- what might he not say to Eleanor about her?_<br/>I have, as I said, done Mortimer some turns which he might remember, though it did not become me to remind him of them.

_In this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries, on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose, the hours passed away, and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for._<br/> We all looked from one to the other, but though many faces were doubtful or desponding, none had a word to say against the night attack, for it was clear that our action in any case must be hazardous, and this had at least the merit of promising a better chance of success than any other.

_The pressing anxieties of thought, which prevented her from noticing anything before her, when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston, saved her at the same time from watching her progress; and though no object on the road could engage a moment's attention, she found no stage of it tedious._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_From this, she was preserved too by another cause, by feeling no eagerness for her journey's conclusion; for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best, even after an absence such as hers-- an eleven weeks' absence._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_What had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family, that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it, extend an useless resentment, and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will?_<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_She could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor's merit; she felt it too strongly for expression; and should a dislike be taken against them, should they be thought of unfavourably, on their father's account, it would cut her to the heart._<br/>What did it matter to me if she hated the sound of his voice, or if he put every indignity upon her in the hope of breaking her spirit, and spoke to her as he would never have dared to speak to one of his servants?

_With these feelings, she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well-known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home._<br/> During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies.

_Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger; but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post-masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it; so great had been her ignorance of her route._<br/> I should have wished to have limited my story to Beaufort and his message, but as the council seemed to be intent upon hearing a full account of my journey, I told in as short and simple speech as I could the various passages which had befallen me-- the ambuscado of the smugglers, the cave, the capture of the gauger, the journey in the lugger, the acquaintance with Farmer Brown, my being cast into prison, with the manner of my release and the message wherewith I had been commissioned.

_She met with nothing, however, to distress or frighten her._<br/>She said nothing, but that face of hers was one long wail of fear.

_Her youth, civil manners, and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require; and stopping only to change horses, she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm, and between six and seven o'clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton._<br/>I look back at the chain of incidents, my interview with McArdle, Challenger's first note of alarm in the Times, the absurd journey in the train, the pleasant luncheon, the catastrophe, and now it has come to this-- that we linger alone upon an empty planet, and so sure is our fate that I can regard these lines, written from mechanical professional habit and never to be seen by human eyes, as the words of one who is already dead, so closely does he stand to the shadowed borderland over which all outside this one little circle of friends have already gone.

_A heroine returning, at the close of her career, to her native village, in all the triumph of recovered reputation, and all the dignity of a countess, with a long train of noble relations in their several phaetons, and three waiting-maids in a travelling chaise and four, behind her, is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well delight to dwell; it gives credit to every conclusion, and the author must share in the glory she so liberally bestows._<br/> The Empress had graciously offered me a seat in her berline, and all the way to the village, entirely forgetful apparently of the scene through which she passed, she chatted away, asking me a thousand personal questions about myself and my affairs, for a kindly curiosity in the doings of everyone around her was one of her most marked characteristics.

_But my affair is widely different; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and disgrace; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_A heroine in a hack post-chaise is such a blow upon sentiment, as no attempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand._<br/>Never have I travelled at such a pace, and never have I felt such a sense of exhilaration from the rush of keen upland air upon our faces, and from the sight of those two glorious creatures stretched to their utmost, with the roar of their hoofs and the rattle of our wheels as the light curricle bounded and swayed behind them.

_Swiftly therefore shall her post-boy drive through the village, amid the gaze of Sunday groups, and speedy shall be her descent from it._<br/>I pursued her with some thoughts of an explanation, but she flew down the drive, and some minutes afterwards I was able to pick her out with my field-glasses traveling very rapidly in a south-westerly direction.

_But, whatever might be the distress of Catherine's mind, as she thus advanced towards the parsonage, and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it, she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went; first, in the appearance of her carriage-- and secondly, in herself._<br/> She worked upon me so, partly with her scorn and partly with this money that she held before my eyes, that I believe I should have yielded and taken my chances upstairs, had it not been that I saw her eyes following the struggle within me in such a crafty, malignant fashion, that it was evident she was bent upon making me the tool of her revenge, and that she would leave me no choice but to do the old man an injury or to be captured by him.

_The chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in Fullerton, the whole family were immediately at the window; and to have it stop at the sweep-gate was a pleasure to brighten every eye and occupy every fancy-- a pleasure quite unlooked for by all but the two youngest children, a boy and girl of six and four years old, who expected a brother or sister in every carriage._<br/>In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to, I seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which I had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science, but that it was really something tremendous, a breaking down of the walls between two worlds, a direct undeniable message from beyond, a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction.

_Happy the glance that first distinguished Catherine!_<br/>From the first glance I saw that she was mine.

_Happy the voice that proclaimed the discovery!_<br/>said the same gentle voice which had spoken first.'

_But whether such happiness were the lawful property of George or Harriet could never be exactly understood._<br/>As such, they were not likely to have any great love for the Government, or desire to uphold King James in any way.

_Her father, mother, Sarah, George, and Harriet, all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness, was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine's heart; and in the embrace of each, as she stepped from the carriage, she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_So surrounded, so caressed, she was even happy!_<br/>Then I had a sudden happy thought.

_In the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued, and the pleasure of seeing her, leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity, they were all seated round the tea-table, which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller, whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice, before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her._<br/>He had certainly a strange audience to harangue: his wife perfectly acquiescent and absolutely ignorant of his meaning, Summerlee seated in the shadow, querulous and critical but interested, Lord John lounging in a corner somewhat bored by the whole proceeding, and myself beside the window watching the scene with a kind of detached attention, as if it were all a dream or something in which I had no personal interest whatever.

_Reluctantly, and with much hesitation, did she then begin what might perhaps, at the end of half an hour, be termed, by the courtesy of her hearers, an explanation; but scarcely, within that time, could they at all discover the cause, or collect the particulars, of her sudden return._<br/> We all looked from one to the other, but though many faces were doubtful or desponding, none had a word to say against the night attack, for it was clear that our action in any case must be hazardous, and this had at least the merit of promising a better chance of success than any other.

_They were far from being an irritable race; far from any quickness in catching, or bitterness in resenting, affronts: but here, when the whole was unfolded, was an insult not to be overlooked, nor, for the first half hour, to be easily pardoned._<br/>They were never at their ease, always upon the brink of a catastrophe, encouraged one day only to be rudely rebuffed the next, bullied in public and slighted in private, and yet, in spite of it all, the singular fact remains that they loved him and served him as no monarch has been loved and served.

_Without suffering any romantic alarm, in the consideration of their daughter's long and lonely journey, Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her; that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered; and that, in forcing her on such a measure, General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly-- neither as a gentleman nor as a parent._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Why he had done it, what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality, and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will, was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself; but it did not oppress them by any means so long; and, after a due course of useless conjecture, that`` it was a strange business, and that he must be a very strange man,'' grew enough for all their indignation and wonder; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility, exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_`` My dear, you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble,'' said her mother at last;`` depend upon it, it is something not at all worth understanding.''_<br/>But I shall speak of a time when the love of a mother was the only love I knew, and if you seek for something more, then it is not for you that I write.

_`` I can allow for his wishing Catherine away, when he recollected this engagement,'' said Sarah,`` but why not do it civilly?''_<br/>`` You understand everything now, Colonel Gerard,'' said he,`` and you will forgive me if I did not take you into my complete confidence before.

_`` I am sorry for the young people,'' returned Mrs. Morland;`` they must have a sad time of it; but as for anything else, it is no matter now; Catherine is safe at home, and our comfort does not depend upon General Tilney.''_<br/>' I am much beholden to you, sir,' I answered,` but I fear that there is no help which you can give me, unless, indeed, you could convey news to my friends in the army of what hath befallen me.'

_Catherine sighed._<br/>she murmured.

_`` Well,'' continued her philosophic mother,`` I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time; but now it is all over, perhaps there is no great harm done._<br/>` Now, sir,' she continued,' I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative.

_It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves; and you know, my dear Catherine, you always were a sad little scatter-brained creature; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you, with so much changing of chaises and so forth; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets.''_<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_Catherine hoped so too, and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment, but her spirits were quite worn down; and, to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish, she readily agreed to her mother's next counsel of going early to bed._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_Her parents, seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified feelings, and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey, parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away; and though, when they all met the next morning, her recovery was not equal to their hopes, they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_They never once thought of her heart, which, for the parents of a young lady of seventeen, just returned from her first excursion from home, was odd enough!_<br/>During the twelve years that she had kept house for him, his younger sister had never known him a second behind his time.

_As soon as breakfast was over, she sat down to fulfil her promise to Miss Tilney, whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend's disposition was already justified, for already did Catherine reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly, with having never enough valued her merits or kindness, and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_The strength of these feelings, however, was far from assisting her pen; and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing Eleanor Tilney._<br/>She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.

_To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation, convey gratitude without servile regret, be guarded without coldness, and honest without resentment-- a letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of-- and, above all, which she might not blush herself, if Henry should chance to see, was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance; and, after long thought and much perplexity, to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_The money therefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks, and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart._<br/>His blood hath through his daughter been transmitted to the ten of us, though I rejoice to say that I, being the tenth, it had by that time lost much of its virulence, and indeed amounts to little more than a proper pride, and a laudable desire to prosper.'

_`` This has been a strange acquaintance,'' observed Mrs. Morland, as the letter was finished;`` soon made and soon ended._<br/> And yet somehow the possibility and even the probability of it had occurred to me from the beginning, and I believe that it had to Harrison also, for I had noticed that his face grew grave and troubled from the very moment that there was talk of the stranger below.

_I am sorry it happens so, for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella._<br/>`` I'm sorry to gainsay you, lad, but there are reasons why I had rather you stayed down here with your aunt.''

_Ah!_<br/>Ah!

_Poor James!_<br/>`` Poor papa!

_Well, we must live and learn; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping.''_<br/>But we shall hold your money, my friend, and it will strengthen us to feel that it is there.''

_Catherine coloured as she warmly answered,`` No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor.''_<br/> Nay, dear friends, do not look sad, for what can be happier than a life completed in honour and made beautiful with friendship and love?

_`` If so, my dear, I dare say you will meet again some time or other; do not be uneasy._<br/>`` I dare not go down alone, dear, but if you will come with me.

_It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years; and then what a pleasure it will be!''_<br/>I have but seen them this once in ten years, and it may be ten more, for all I know, ere I see them again.

_Mrs. Morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation._<br/>`` No one who was not good could be so absolutely happy as she seems to be.

_The hope of meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into Catherine's head what might happen within that time to make a meeting dreadful to her._<br/>All I ask is that you read it-- just read it-- and then that you make an inquiry or two about the private character of this`` lady'' Mannering, if she still keeps the name that she had three years ago, when to my sorrow and ruin I came to meet her.

_She could never forget Henry Tilney, or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment; but he might forget her; and in that case, to meet--!_<br/>She and I never took to each other very much; but now I hope all that may be ended, and when I marry she will come and stay with me.''

_Her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed; and her mother, perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect, proposed, as another expedient for restoring her spirits, that they should call on Mrs. Allen._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart; and, as they walked, Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James's disappointment._<br/> They walked on together side by side, she brooding over some thought of her own, and he a little crossed and disappointed at her caprice and the lost commission for Harold.

_`` We are sorry for him,'' said she;`` but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off; for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with, and who was so entirely without fortune; and now, after such behaviour, we can not think at all well of her._<br/>It seemed a poor return for all the courtesy which we encountered that we should deceive our hosts and benefactors, but under the circumstances we had really no alternative, and I hereby tell them that they will only waste their time and their money if they attempt to follow upon our traces.

_Just at present it comes hard to poor James; but that will not last forever; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life, for the foolishness of his first choice.''_<br/>But I thought at the time-- and I was not the only one-- that this man's name and work would not be forgotten, and that there would be a curse on the place that had done such a deed.

_This was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could listen to; another sentence might have endangered her complaisance, and made her reply less rational; for soon were all her thinking powers swallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits since last she had trodden that well-known road._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_It was not three months ago since, wild with joyful expectation, she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day, with an heart light, gay, and independent; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed, and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it._<br/>He had not yet attained his full six foot of stature, but no judge of a man-LRB- and every woman, at least, is one-RRB- could look at his perfect shoulders, his narrow loins, and his proud head that sat upon his neck like an eagle upon its perch, without feeling that sober joy which all that is beautiful in Nature gives to us-- a vague self- content, as though in some way we also had a hand in the making of it.

_Three months ago had seen her all this; and now, how altered a being did she return!_<br/>What did I do ten months ago which inspired you with such a particular affection for me?

_She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her unlooked-for appearance, acting on a steady affection, would naturally call forth; and great was their surprise, and warm their displeasure, on hearing how she had been treated-- though Mrs. Morland's account of it was no inflated representation, no studied appeal to their passions._<br/> Thinking, as I did, that he was speaking of our own old Queen Charlotte, I could make no meaning out of this; but my father told me afterwards that both Nelson and Lady Hamilton had conceived an extraordinary affection for the Queen of Naples, and that it was the interests of her little kingdom which he had so strenuously at heart.

_`` Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening,'' said she._<br/>Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained, and likely to be very late.

_`` She travelled all the way post by herself, and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night; for General Tilney, from some odd fancy or other, all of a sudden grew tired of having her there, and almost turned her out of the house._<br/>In the early morning my landlady found me stretched senseless before the silver mirror, but I knew nothing myself until three days ago I awoke in the deep peace of the doctor's nursing home.

_Very unfriendly, certainly; and he must be a very odd man; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again!_<br/>`` This fellow may be very clever,'' I said to myself,`` but he is certainly very conceited.''

_And it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature, but can shift very well for herself.''_<br/>It's not a pleasant side, I am afraid, but if it is good enough for Providence to create, it is good enough for us to try and understand.

_Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself._<br/> But in spite of the evident hatred of her husband's family, the Empress appeared to be entirely unconcerned and at her ease as she strolled about among the groups of her guests with a kindly glance and a pleasant word for each of them.

_His wonder, his conjectures, and his explanations became in succession hers, with the addition of this single remark--`` I really have not patience with the general''-- to fill up every accidental pause._<br/>He had not imagination enough to realise that the experience which seemed so appallingly important to him, was the merest everyday matter of business to the medical man who could not have lived for a year had he not, amid the rush of work, remembered what was due to his own health.

_And,`` I really have not patience with the general,'' was uttered twice after Mr. Allen left the room, without any relaxation of anger, or any material digression of thought._<br/>Never shall I forget the sudden flash of hope which shone in his dark eyes when he saw a comrade burst into the room, or the look of despair which followed as he understood that I had come not to change his fate but to share it.

_A more considerable degree of wandering attended the third repetition; and, after completing the fourth, she immediately added,`` Only think, my dear, of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended, before I left Bath, that one can hardly see where it was._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_I must show it you some day or other._<br/>I'll tell you some day.

_Bath is a nice place, Catherine, after all._<br/>`` It's all so beautiful and natural until this kind of thing comes in!

_I assure you I did not above half like coming away._<br/>So I did not look up till all was finished.

_Mrs. Thorpe's being there was such a comfort to us, was not it?_<br/>But Gladys-- was it not the very opportunity of which she spoke?

_You know, you and I were quite forlorn at first.''_<br/>As it was, we very nearly lost it at the last moment.''

_`` Yes, but that did not last long,'' said Catherine, her eyes brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence there._<br/>`` I knew you would not shrink at the last,'' said he, and for a moment I saw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had ever seen.

_`` Very true: we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe, and then we wanted for nothing._<br/>' I am glad to hear you say so,' I answered,` for it makes it easier for me to say that I wish to go my own way, and to have nothing more to do with you.

_My dear, do not you think these silk gloves wear very well?_<br/>` For myself, I do n't fear a wet jacket or a tarry hand for the cause, and I doubt not ye are all of my way of thinking.

_I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms, you know, and I have worn them a great deal since._<br/>But when I had written it, it seemed so dreadfully stiff that I had to put a little beginning and end of my own, which seemed to brighten it up a good deal.''

_Do you remember that evening?''_<br/>Do you recall the hour?''

_`` Do I!_<br/>`` Do it!''

_Oh!_<br/>Oh!

_Perfectly.''_<br/>Five-and-fifty.

_`` It was very agreeable, was not it?_<br/>`` Remarkable, is it not?

_Mr. Tilney drank tea with us, and I always thought him a great addition, he is so very agreeable._<br/>Rum is good, and so is schnapps, but I'd as lief have tea as either.''

_I have a notion you danced with him, but am not quite sure._<br/>`` I know very well that I am not clever or anything of that sort, but still I would do all I can to make you very happy.

_I remember I had my favourite gown on.''_<br/>I was his favourite aide-de-camp.

_Catherine could not answer; and, after a short trial of other subjects, Mrs. Allen again returned to--`` I really have not patience with the general!_<br/>` Madam,-- I would not take the boldness of writing to your Majesty till I had shown the King how I do abhor the thing that I have done, and how much I desire to live to serve him.

_Such an agreeable, worthy man as he seemed to be!_<br/>And besides, he is forced to be a good man.

_I do not suppose, Mrs. Morland, you ever saw a better-bred man in your life._<br/>He's not the same man he used to be, though I make free to say that he was never quite one of my gentlemen, like Mr. Hastie or yourself, sir.

_His lodgings were taken the very day after he left them, Catherine._<br/>And his daughter-- what was to become of her after he was gone?

_But no wonder; Milsom Street, you know.''_<br/>You have heard, no doubt, of Curupuri?''

_As they walked home again, Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter's mind the happiness of having such steady well-wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen, and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her, while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_There was a great deal of good sense in all this; but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power; and Catherine's feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced._<br/>My only claim to being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences here I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well-- indeed, upon my Cornish mother's side I could call them cousins-- and their strange fate has naturally been a great shock to me.

_It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations, Catherine was silently reflecting that now Henry must have arrived at Northanger; now he must have heard of her departure; and now, perhaps, they were all setting off for Hereford._<br/>For you may remember, my children, that I stated when I first took it in hand to narrate to you these passages of my life, that the hopes of Monmouth's party rested very much upon the raid which Argyle and the Scottish exiles had made upon Ayrshire, where it was hoped that they would create such a disturbance as would divert a good share of King James's forces, and so make our march to London less difficult.

_CHAPTER 30  Catherine's disposition was not naturally sedentary, nor had her habits been ever very industrious; but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort, her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased._<br/> Her companions would not believe her, for they could see nothing, but there are moments when our mortal senses are more acute than those who have never put their whole heart and soul into them can ever realise.

_She could neither sit still nor employ herself for ten minutes together, walking round the garden and orchard again and again, as if nothing but motion was voluntary; and it seemed as if she could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time in the parlour._<br/>I took the precaution of walking the horse very quietly until we were some distance from the house, for I had told Reuben nothing of my intended journey, and I was convinced that if he knew of it neither discipline, nor even his new ties of love, would prevent him from coming with me.

_Her loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration._<br/>She was a unit, a factor,-- nothing more.

_In her rambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature of herself; but in her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all that she had been before._<br/> I was at my wit's ends what to do, whether to be silent, or to tell her of the terrible position in which her lover was placed; but, even as I hesitated, she, with the quick intuition of a woman, read the doubts which were in my mind.

_For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint; but when a third night's rest had neither restored her cheerfulness, improved her in useful activity, nor given her a greater inclination for needlework, she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of,`` My dear Catherine, I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_I do not know when poor Richard's cravats would be done, if he had no friend but you._<br/>I did not know that he belonged to these horrible people, or I should not have admitted him.

_Your head runs too much upon Bath; but there is a time for everything-- a time for balls and plays, and a time for work._<br/>Up to now it has been capricious in the places which it has attacked, but the difference is only a matter of a few hours, and it is like an advancing tide which covers one strip of sand and then another, running hither and thither in irregular streams, until at last it has submerged it all.

_You have had a long run of amusement, and now you must try to be useful.''_<br/>I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it.

_Catherine took up her work directly, saying, in a dejected voice, that`` her head did not run upon Bath-- much.''_<br/> The innkeeper scratched his head and looked at me in despair, but it was very evident to me that it was neither for France nor for Belgium that this woman cared, but that it was the safety of her own house that was nearest her heart.

_`` Then you are fretting about General Tilney, and that is very simple of you; for ten to one whether you ever see him again._<br/>`` After all,'' said he,`` it is stupid to pray all your life, and not to pray now when we have nothing to hope for except through the goodness of Providence.''

_You should never fret about trifles.''_<br/>Never fret about that!

_After a short silence--`` I hope, my Catherine, you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as Northanger._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed._<br/>It may be an evil one.

_Wherever you are you should always be contented, but especially at home, because there you must spend the most of your time._<br/>You'll understand that I really do love you when I tell you that, if it were not that I knew you were frightened and unhappy, these last two days in which we have been always together would have been infinitely the happiest of my life.''

_I did not quite like, at breakfast, to hear you talk so much about the French bread at Northanger.''_<br/> It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast.

_`` I am sure I do not care about the bread._<br/>' I do not care what you require of me.

_It is all the same to me what I eat.''_<br/>That is all that I can say.''

_`` There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject, about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance-- The Mirror, I think._<br/> How foolish of me, the old, broken man, to dwell upon these successes, and yet I will confess that my age has been very much soothed and comforted by the memory of the women who have loved me and the men whom I have overcome.

_I will look it out for you some day or other, because I am sure it will do you good.''_<br/>`` I'll look in once a week or so, and see how you are.''

_Catherine said no more, and, with an endeavour to do right, applied to her work; but, after a few minutes, sunk again, without knowing it herself, into languor and listlessness, moving herself in her chair, from the irritation of weariness, much oftener than she moved her needle._<br/> I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the case and to lay the narrative before my readers.

_Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse; and seeing, in her daughter's absent and dissatisfied look, the full proof of that repining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of cheerfulness, hastily left the room to fetch the book in question, anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_It was some time before she could find what she looked for; and other family matters occurring to detain her, a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere she returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped._<br/>For an hour or more my poor mother and I did what we could to soothe him, while the children whimpered in a corner, until at last he staggered slowly to his feet, and in brief broken words ordered us to our rooms.

_Her avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself, she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes, till, on entering the room, the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had never seen before._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_With a look of much respect, he immediately rose, and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as`` Mr. Henry Tilney,'' with the embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologize for his appearance there, acknowledging that after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at Fullerton, and stating his impatience to be assured of Miss Morland's having reached her home in safety, as the cause of his intrusion._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_He did not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart._<br/>I did not know that he belonged to these horrible people, or I should not have admitted him.

_Far from comprehending him or his sister in their father's misconduct, Mrs. Morland had been always kindly disposed towards each, and instantly, pleased by his appearance, received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence; thanking him for such an attention to her daughter, assuring him that the friends of her children were always welcome there, and entreating him to say not another word of the past._<br/>The less experienced a doctor is, the higher are his notions of professional dignity, as I need not remind you, my young friend, so I was about to refuse the commission with indignation, when I bethought me that, quite apart from medicine, we were gentleman and lady, and that she had asked me to do something for her which was evidently of the greatest possible importance in her eyes.

_He was not ill-inclined to obey this request, for, though his heart was greatly relieved by such unlooked-for mildness, it was not just at that moment in his power to say anything to the purpose._<br/> He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner.

_Returning in silence to his seat, therefore, he remained for some minutes most civilly answering all Mrs. Morland's common remarks about the weather and roads._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Catherine meanwhile-- the anxious, agitated, happy, feverish Catherine-- said not a word; but her glowing cheek and brightened eye made her mother trust that this good-natured visit would at least set her heart at ease for a time, and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of The Mirror for a future hour._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_Desirous of Mr. Morland's assistance, as well in giving encouragement, as in finding conversation for her guest, whose embarrassment on his father's account she earnestly pitied, Mrs. Morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him; but Mr. Morland was from home-- and being thus without any support, at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say._<br/> The Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott.

_After a couple of minutes' unbroken silence, Henry, turning to Catherine for the first time since her mother's entrance, asked her, with sudden alacrity, if Mr. and Mrs. Allen were now at Fullerton?_<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_And on developing, from amidst all her perplexity of words in reply, the meaning, which one short syllable would have given, immediately expressed his intention of paying his respects to them, and, with a rising colour, asked her if she would have the goodness to show him the way._<br/>Having described the genesis of their journey, and paid a handsome tribute to his friend Professor Challenger, coupled with an apology for the incredulity with which his assertions, now fully vindicated, had been received, he gave the actual course of their journey, carefully withholding such information as would aid the public in any attempt to locate this remarkable plateau.

_`` You may see the house from this window, sir,'' was information on Sarah's side, which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman, and a silencing nod from her mother; for Mrs. Morland, thinking it probable, as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours, that he might have some explanation to give of his father's behaviour, which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine, would not on any account prevent her accompanying him._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_They began their walk, and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it._<br/>I took the precaution of walking the horse very quietly until we were some distance from the house, for I had told Reuben nothing of my intended journey, and I was convinced that if he knew of it neither discipline, nor even his new ties of love, would prevent him from coming with me.

_Some explanation on his father's account he had to give; but his first purpose was to explain himself, and before they reached Mr. Allen's grounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often._<br/>For some time I was sustained in my scepticism by the consideration that many famous men, such as Darwin himself, Huxley, Tyndall and Herbert Spencer, derided this new branch of knowledge; but when I learned that their derision had reached such a point that they would not even examine it, and that Spencer had declared in so many words that he had decided against it on a priori grounds, while Huxley had said that it did not interest him, I was bound to admit that, however great, they were in science, their action in this respect was most unscientific and dogmatic, while the action of those who studied the phenomena and tried to find out the laws that governed them, was following the true path which has given us all human advance and knowledge.

_She was assured of his affection; and that heart in return was solicited, which, perhaps, they pretty equally knew was already entirely his own; for, though Henry was now sincerely attached to her, though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society, I must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude, or, in other words, that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought._<br/>Neither of the others seemed very fond of him, for they were each, as was easy to see, proud of their chieftainship, and anxious to use their authority, referring continually to those noble ancestors from whom it was derived; while Lanc though he was equally well born, took the view of the common men upon every occasion, claiming that the interests of the many were superior to the privileges of the few.

_It is a new circumstance in romance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine's dignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own._<br/>I am aware that all these accounts of life beyond the grave differ in detail-- I suppose any of our accounts of the present life would differ in detail-- but in the main there is a very great resemblance, which in this instance was very far from the conception either of myself or of either of the two ladies who made up the circle.

_A very short visit to Mrs. Allen, in which Henry talked at random, without sense or connection, and Catherine, rapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness, scarcely opened her lips, dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tete-a-tete; and before it was suffered to close, she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_On his return from Woodston, two days before, he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father, hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland's departure, and ordered to think of her no more._<br/> De Caulaincourt had moved on to speak with some lady, and I was again left to my own thoughts, which turned upon this extraordinary man, who presented himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoiled child, with his nobler and his worse side alternating so rapidly that I had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion.

_Such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand._<br/>`` I should wish to be near and dear to both of you,'' said he, as he took her hand.

_The affrighted Catherine, amidst all the terrors of expectation, as she listened to this account, could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection, by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject; and as he proceeded to give the particulars, and explain the motives of his father's conduct, her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight._<br/>cried Lady Hamilton, and straightway she began to talk of the admiral and of his doings with such extravagance of praise and such a shower of compliments and of epithets, that my father and I did not know which way to look, feeling shame and sorrow for a man who was compelled to listen to such things said in his own presence.

_The general had had nothing to accuse her of, nothing to lay to her charge, but her being the involuntary, unconscious object of a deception which his pride could not pardon, and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own._<br/>What did it matter to me if she hated the sound of his voice, or if he put every indignity upon her in the hope of breaking her spirit, and spoke to her as he would never have dared to speak to one of his servants?

_She was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be._<br/>If love had not come to her yet, there was at least pity and sympathy, which are nearly akin to it.

_Under a mistaken persuasion of her possessions and claims, he had courted her acquaintance in Bath, solicited her company at Northanger, and designed her for his daughter-in-law._<br/> Thinking, as I did, that he was speaking of our own old Queen Charlotte, I could make no meaning out of this; but my father told me afterwards that both Nelson and Lady Hamilton had conceived an extraordinary affection for the Queen of Naples, and that it was the interests of her little kingdom which he had so strenuously at heart.

_On discovering his error, to turn her from the house seemed the best, though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself, and his contempt of her family._<br/>He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.

_John Thorpe had first misled him._<br/> Again I had to confess that he had beaten me.

_The general, perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss Morland, had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her than her name._<br/>He was married to the second daughter of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir Lothian's descendants have their eye upon the property, they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them.

_Thorpe, most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney's importance, had been joyfully and proudly communicative; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland's engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself, his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them._<br/>For some time I was sustained in my scepticism by the consideration that many famous men, such as Darwin himself, Huxley, Tyndall and Herbert Spencer, derided this new branch of knowledge; but when I learned that their derision had reached such a point that they would not even examine it, and that Spencer had declared in so many words that he had decided against it on a priori grounds, while Huxley had said that it did not interest him, I was bound to admit that, however great, they were in science, their action in this respect was most unscientific and dogmatic, while the action of those who studied the phenomena and tried to find out the laws that governed them, was following the true path which has given us all human advance and knowledge.

_With whomsoever he was, or was likely to be connected, his own consequence always required that theirs should be great, and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew their fortune._<br/>Then, when I taxed him with the matter, he had the strongest reasons for wishing me out of the way, before I could convey my knowledge to any one else.

_The expectations of his friend Morland, therefore, from the first overrated, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment, by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland's preferment, trebling his private fortune, bestowing a rich aunt, and sinking half the children, he was able to represent the whole family to the general in a most respectable light._<br/>He divided his great wealth among his many nephews, and I found myself with sufficient to provide amply for my wants during the remainder of my life, and became at the same time the owner of a bleak tract of land upon the coast of Caithness, which I think the old man must have bestowed upon me in derision, for it was sandy and valueless, and he had ever a grim sense of humour.

_For Catherine, however, the peculiar object of the general's curiosity, and his own speculations, he had yet something more in reserve, and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen's estate._<br/>How spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by Miss Julia Ames, who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication, but admitted, after fifteen years, that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over.

_Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter; and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed._<br/>But when I ventured to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if this gross flattery of her ladyship's were the dearest thing in all the world to him.

_Upon such intelligence the general had proceeded; for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority._<br/>From that time I have never heard him allude to the matter, nor did he ever give us any reason why he should so confidently have expected the second coming upon that particular night.

_Thorpe's interest in the family, by his sister's approaching connection with one of its members, and his own views on another-LRB- circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness-RRB-, seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth; and to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless, of Miss Morland's being under their care, and-- as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge-- of their treating her with parental kindness._<br/>How close is the connection between kindred souls over there is shown by the way in which Myers, Gurney and Roden Noel, all friends and co-workers on earth, sent messages together through Mrs. Holland, who knew none of them, each message being characteristic to those who knew the men in life-- or the way in which Professor Verrall and Professor Butcher, both famous Greek scholars, collaborated to produce the Greek problem which has been analysed by Mr. Gerald Balfour in The Ear of Dionysius, with the result that that excellent authority testified that the effect COULD have been attained by no other entities, save only Verrall and Butcher.

_His resolution was soon formed._<br/>My plans were already formed.

_Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe's communication, he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes._<br/>As for me, I had sprung to the side of the old friend of my boyhood, and was trying to tell him my joy at his good fortune, and listening to his assurance that nothing that could ever befall him could weaken the love that he bore me.

_Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this, than his own children._<br/>She had not spoken more than three or four times with her nephew, and knew nothing more of him than he had told her on the evening before.

_Henry and Eleanor, perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father's particular respect, had seen with astonishment the suddenness, continuance, and extent of his attention; and though latterly, from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her, Henry was convinced of his father's believing it to be an advantageous connection, it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on._<br/>For some time I was sustained in my scepticism by the consideration that many famous men, such as Darwin himself, Huxley, Tyndall and Herbert Spencer, derided this new branch of knowledge; but when I learned that their derision had reached such a point that they would not even examine it, and that Spencer had declared in so many words that he had decided against it on a priori grounds, while Huxley had said that it did not interest him, I was bound to admit that, however great, they were in science, their action in this respect was most unscientific and dogmatic, while the action of those who studied the phenomena and tried to find out the laws that governed them, was following the true path which has given us all human advance and knowledge.

_That they were false, the general had learnt from the very person who had suggested them, from Thorpe himself, whom he had chanced to meet again in town, and who, under the influence of exactly opposite feelings, irritated by Catherine's refusal, and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella, convinced that they were separated forever, and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable, hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands-- confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character, misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit, whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families, with the most liberal proposals, he had, on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator, been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.

_They were, in fact, a necessitous family; numerous, too, almost beyond example; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood, as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections; a forward, bragging, scheming race._<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_The terrified general pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error._<br/>`` But, Fritz,'' the Professor cried, very much startled by this view of the matter,`` I had relied upon your assistance in the attempt.

_The Allens, he believed, had lived near them too long, and he knew the young man on whom the Fullerton estate must devolve._<br/>But, then, Champion Harrison told me how the fighting-men lived there, and my father how the heads of the Navy lived there, and my mother how her brother and his grand friends were there, until at last I was consumed with impatience to see this marvellous heart of England.

_The general needed no more._<br/>He needs no more.''

_Enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself, he set out the next day for the abbey, where his performances have been seen._<br/>Belcher was half frenzied by this sudden ending of all the pains which he had taken in the training, and could only rave out threats at Berks and his companions, with terrible menaces as to what he would do when he met them.

_I leave it to my reader's sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine, how much of it he could have learnt from his father, in what points his own conjectures might assist him, and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_I have united for their case what they must divide for mine._<br/>I know their ways, and we must be ready for it.

_Catherine, at any rate, heard enough to feel that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife, she had scarcely sinned against his character, or magnified his cruelty._<br/>A second question from us failed to elicit any answer at all, save a plaintive bleat from his wife to the effect that her husband was in a very violent temper already, and that she hoped we would do nothing to make it worse.

_Henry, in having such things to relate of his father, was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself._<br/>`` My father was a man who was noted for his almost morbid love of truth.

_He blushed for the narrow-minded counsel which he was obliged to expose._<br/>I forgave him the trick by which he had caught me and the selfish fears to which he had been willing to sacrifice me.

_The conversation between them at Northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind._<br/>My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it.

_Henry's indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated, on comprehending his father's views, and being ordered to acquiesce in them, had been open and bold._<br/>In most armies it would have been conceded that my father was within his rights in punishing promptly so rank an act of mutiny, but the soldiers of Cromwell had so high a notion of their own importance and privileges, that they resented this summary justice upon their companion.

_The general, accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family, prepared for no reluctance but of feeling, no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words, could ill brook the opposition of his son, steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it._<br/>Then there was a silence, which lasted until her death; and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that I can not show it to you, begging me never to think evil of him, giving me much good advice, and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother, but that the opening might still cause pain to others, and that, therefore, he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twenty-first year, for the lapse of time would make things easier.

_But, in such a cause, his anger, though it must shock, could not intimidate Henry, who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice._<br/>For this cause, though not wanting in natural courage, they did little service during the war, and were a hindrance rather than a help to the army.

_He felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland, and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain, no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent, no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger, could shake his fidelity, or influence the resolutions it prompted._<br/>And so also, when the ring has become as extinct as the lists, we may understand that a broader philosophy would show that all things, which spring up so naturally and spontaneously, have a function to fulfil, and that it is a less evil that two men should, of their own free will, fight until they can fight no more than that the standard of hardihood and endurance should run the slightest risk of being lowered in a nation which depends so largely upon the individual qualities of her citizens for her defence.

_He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire, an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine, and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand._<br/>`` My dear sir,'' said I,`` if I may speak with the frankness of a professional adviser, I should say that it is very clear that your father had the strongest reasons for keeping out of the country, and that, if nothing has been proved against him, he at least thought that something might be, and refused to put himself within the power of the law.

_The general was furious in his anger, and they parted in dreadful disagreement._<br/>Even my furious and distempered mind recognised it as being a solemn and courteous leave-taking.

_Henry, in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose, had returned almost instantly to Woodston, and, on the afternoon of the following day, had begun his journey to Fullerton._<br/>With a stony face and an unsympathetic manner he had received, upon his return to Haifa, all the commiserations about the dreadful way in which his privations had blanched him, and then diving into his cabin, he had reappeared within an hour exactly as he had been before that fatal moment when he had been cut off from the manifold resources of civilisation.

_CHAPTER 31  Mr. and Mrs. Morland's surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was, for a few minutes, considerable, it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side; but as nothing, after all, could be more natural than Catherine's being beloved, they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride, and, as far as they alone were concerned, had not a single objection to start._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_His pleasing manners and good sense were self-evident recommendations; and having never heard evil of him, it was not their way to suppose any evil could be told._<br/>Still, I could not see what harm could come to me by complying with his request, and certainly I could not have devised any arrangement which would give me such an opportunity of satisfying my curiosity.

_Goodwill supplying the place of experience, his character needed no attestation._<br/>You need no chart of directions now, since you will have the inestimable advantage of my own guidance.

_`` Catherine would make a sad, heedless young housekeeper to be sure,'' was her mother's foreboding remark; but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice._<br/>Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good.

_There was but one obstacle, in short, to be mentioned; but till that one was removed, it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement._<br/> I heard nothing more of the matter for some time, and had almost feared that it would prove to be one of those fleeting experiences which drift away from our direct observation and end only in a hope or a suspicion.

_Their tempers were mild, but their principles were steady, and while his parent so expressly forbade the connection, they could not allow themselves to encourage it._<br/>I can not think how the historian of the future can hope to understand them, when I, who knew one of them so well, and bore his blood in my veins, could never quite tell how much of him was real, and how much was due to the affectations which he had cultivated so long that they had ceased to deserve the name.

_That the general should come forward to solicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily approve it, they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded, and that once obtained-- and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied-- their willing approbation was instantly to follow._<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_His consent was all that they wished for._<br/>The management was all that could be desired.

_They were no more inclined than entitled to demand his money._<br/>I have no more time to waste on the matter.''

_Of a very considerable fortune, his son was, by marriage settlements, eventually secure; his present income was an income of independence and comfort, and under every pecuniary view, it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter._<br/>His money, which had ruined what might have been a great life, was divided amongst many bequests, an annuity to his valet, Ambrose, being amongst them; but enough has come to his sister, my dear mother, to help to make her old age as sunny and as pleasant as even I could wish.

_The young people could not be surprised at a decision like this._<br/> The first of these occurred when I was so young that I can remember neither what went before nor what immediately after it.

_They felt and they deplored-- but they could not resent it; and they parted, endeavouring to hope that such a change in the general, as each believed almost impossible, might speedily take place, to unite them again in the fullness of privileged affection._<br/>Since the spirit is by its very nature invisible, we can not see these comings and goings, but we see their effect in the body of the subject, now rigid and inert, now struggling to narrate impressions which could never have come to it by natural means.

_Henry returned to what was now his only home, to watch over his young plantations, and extend his improvements for her sake, to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry._<br/>Thus, pacing slowly, we returned to Bridgewater, where Reuben was carried to our quarters, and I bore the little maid of the marshes to kind townsfolk, who promised to restore her to her home when the troubles were over.

_Whether the torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence, let us not inquire._<br/>Since the spirit is by its very nature invisible, we can not see these comings and goings, but we see their effect in the body of the subject, now rigid and inert, now struggling to narrate impressions which could never have come to it by natural means.

_Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did-- they had been too kind to exact any promise; and whenever Catherine received a letter, as, at that time, happened pretty often, they always looked another way._<br/>Or when Mr. Arthur Hill receives messages from folk of whom he never heard, and afterwards verifies that they are true in every detail, is it not a fair inference that they are speaking truths also when they give any light upon their present condition?

_The anxiety, which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of Henry and Catherine, and of all who loved either, as to its final event, can hardly extend, I fear, to the bosom of my readers, who will see in the tell-tale compression of the pages before them, that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity._<br/> The sudden gush of tenderness in the last few lines made the tears spring to my eyes, and yet I could scarce forbear from smiling at the whole composition, for my dear mother had little time to cultivate the graces of style, and it was evidently her thought that in order to make her instructions binding it was needful to express them in some sort of legal form.

_The means by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt: what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the general's?_<br/>He answered that he had been able lately to prove the marriage, and if some persons are not lately dead, of which he would inform himself, he would yet be able to prove it.

_The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence, which took place in the course of the summer-- an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour, from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry, and his permission for him`` to be a fool if he liked it!''_<br/>But it comforts my heart, my friends, and it brings the tears to my eyes, to think how great I was upon that last day of my soldier life, and to remember that of all the remarkable exploits which have won me the love of so many beautiful women, and the respect of so many noble men, there was none which, in splendour, in audacity, and in the great end which was attained, could compare with my famous ride upon the night of June 18th, 1815.

_The marriage of Eleanor Tilney, her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry's banishment, to the home of her choice and the man of her choice, is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance._<br/>  CHAPTER VII-- THE HOPE OF ENGLAND   My uncle drove for some time in silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.

_My own joy on the occasion is very sincere._<br/>It is a real joy and privilege to me, sir, to make your distinguished acquaintance.

_I know no one more entitled, by unpretending merit, or better prepared by habitual suffering, to receive and enjoy felicity._<br/>I could find no one to join me in my appreciation, and solitary admiration for one's self, however genuine, becomes satiating after a time.

_Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin; and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her._<br/>At first his interest was merely excited by the fact of seeing a man of so venerable an appearance in such a disgraceful condition, but as he approached nearer, he became convinced that he knew the other well, though he could not recall when or where he had met him.

_His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties; and never had the general loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship, utility, and patient endurance as when he first hailed her`` Your Ladyship!''_<br/>Never for an hour had she given him cause to regret it; but this lawyer brother of hers had, as I understood, offended my father by his slavish obsequiousness in days of prosperity and his venomous enmity in the days of trouble.

_Her husband was really deserving of her; independent of his peerage, his wealth, and his attachment, being to a precision the most charming young man in the world._<br/>My father, the descendant of one of the proudest and oldest families in France, had chosen beauty and virtue rather than rank in his wife.

_Any further definition of his merits must be unnecessary; the most charming young man in the world is instantly before the imagination of us all._<br/>But those who knew him best at times when a man may be best known, said that the old soldier had a young man's heart and a young man's spirit,-- so that if he wished to keep a young man's colour also it was not very unreasonable after all.

_Concerning the one in question, therefore, I have only to add-- aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable-- that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing-bills, resulting from a long visit at Northanger, by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures._<br/>The less experienced a doctor is, the higher are his notions of professional dignity, as I need not remind you, my young friend, so I was about to refuse the commission with indignation, when I bethought me that, quite apart from medicine, we were gentleman and lady, and that she had asked me to do something for her which was evidently of the greatest possible importance in her eyes.

_The influence of the viscount and viscountess in their brother's behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland's circumstances which, as soon as the general would allow himself to be informed, they were qualified to give._<br/> The Johnstones were one of the Redesdale families, second cousins of the Armstrongs, and connected by marriage to--'' `` Perhaps, Sir Walter,'' interrupted Thackeray,`` you would take the responsibility off our hands by yourself dictating the commencement of a story to this young literary aspirant.''

_It taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe's first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor, and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds._<br/>I find,'' he continued, glancing over the pages of his ledger,`` that within the last twelve months we have supplied no fewer than seven Latin masters to Willow Lea House Academy, four of them having left so abruptly as to forfeit their month's salary, and none of them having stayed more than eight weeks.''

_This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride; and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence, which he was at some pains to procure, that the Fullerton estate, being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor, was consequently open to every greedy speculation._<br/>It was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautiful-- a life full of easy tolerance for others, of kindly charity, of broad-minded moderation, of gentle courage, always progressive and open to new ideas, and yet never bitter to those ideas which He was really supplanting, though He did occasionally lose His temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters.

_On the strength of this, the general, soon after Eleanor's marriage, permitted his son to return to Northanger, and thence made him the bearer of his consent, very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland._<br/>`` My name is Sawyer-- her's is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her-- and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he's at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops--'' `` Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,'' I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion;`` it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.''

_The event which it authorized soon followed: Henry and Catherine were married, the bells rang, and everybody smiled; and, as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting, it will not appear, after all the dreadful delays occasioned by the general's cruelty, that they were essentially hurt by it._<br/>From his wife to his groom there was not one of those who were about him who did not live in dread of being held up to ridicule and infamy before a smiling crowd, whose amusement was only tempered by the reflection that each of them might be the next to endure the same exposure.

_To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen is to do pretty well; and professing myself moreover convinced that the general's unjust interference, so far from being really injurious to their felicity, was perhaps rather conducive to it, by improving their knowledge of each other, and adding strength to their attachment, I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may concern, whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny, or reward filial disobedience._<br/>At any rate I obtained, at various times, statements-LRB- as my contemporary notes show-RRB- to the effect that, in this persisting state of existence, they have bodies which, though imperceptible by our senses, are as solid to them as ours to us, that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified; that they have no age, no pain, no rich and poor; that they wear clothes and take nourishment; that they do not sleep-LRB- though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called` lying asleep'-- a condition, it just occurs to me, which seems to correspond roughly with the` Hypnoidal' state-RRB-; that, after a period which is usually shorter than the average life-time here, they pass to some further state of existence; that people of similar thoughts, tastes and feelings, gravitate together; that married couples do not necessarily reunite, but that the love of man and woman continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization; that immediately after death people pass into a semi-conscious rest-state lasting various periods, that they are unable to experience bodily pain, but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety; that a painful death is` absolutely unknown,' that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the after-state, and that their life altogether is intensely happy, and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here.
