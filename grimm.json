{"Golden Bird": "A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree\nwhich bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about\nthe time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one\nof them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\ngardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his\neldest son to watch; but about twelve o\u2019clock he fell asleep, and in\nthe morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was\nordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning\nanother apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but\nthe gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come\nto him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself\nunder the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling\nnoise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as\nit was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener\u2019s son\njumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;\nonly it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.\nThe golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the\ncouncil was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than\nall the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, \u2018One feather is of no\nuse to me, I must have the whole bird.\u2019\n\nThen the gardener\u2019s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden\nbird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a\nwood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his\nbow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, \u2018Do not shoot me,\nfor I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and\nthat you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the\nevening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each\nother, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in\nthere, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you\nto be very poor and mean.\u2019 But the son thought to himself, \u2018What can\nsuch a beast as this know about the matter?\u2019 So he shot his arrow at\nthe fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and\nran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to\nthe village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people\nsinging, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,\nand poor. \u2018I should be very silly,\u2019 said he, \u2018if I went to that shabby\nhouse, and left this charming place\u2019; so he went into the smart house,\nand ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.\n\nTime passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings\nwere heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened\nto him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came\nto the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where\nthe merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not\nwithstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and\nhis country in the same manner.\n\nTime passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\nthe wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\nlisten to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\nwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his\ncoming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would\nnot rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard\nthe same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not\nattempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, \u2018Sit upon my\ntail, and you will travel faster.\u2019 So he sat down, and the fox began to\nrun, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair\nwhistled in the wind.\n\nWhen they came to the village, the son followed the fox\u2019s counsel, and\nwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\nnight at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\nwas beginning his journey, and said, \u2018Go straight forward, till you come\nto a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and\nsnoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and\non till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;\nclose by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the\nbird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise\nyou will repent it.\u2019 Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the\nyoung man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till\ntheir hair whistled in the wind.\n\nBefore the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\nand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\nbelow stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\nlost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, \u2018It will be a\nvery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage\u2019; so\nhe opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.\nBut the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and\nthey took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning\nthe court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to\ndie, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as\nswiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird\ngiven him for his own.\n\nSo he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\nwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, \u2018You see now\nwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will\nstill, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as\nI bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the\nhorse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep\nand snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old\nleathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.\u2019\nThen the son sat down on the fox\u2019s tail, and away they went over stock\nand stone till their hair whistled in the wind.\n\nAll went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden\nsaddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity\nto put the leathern saddle upon it. \u2018I will give him the good one,\u2019\nsaid he; \u2018I am sure he deserves it.\u2019 As he took up the golden saddle the\ngroom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took\nhim prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court\nto be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he\ncould bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the\nbird and the horse given him for his own.\n\nThen he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, \u2018Why\ndid not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away\nboth the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go\nstraight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve\no\u2019clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her\nand give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care\nyou do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.\u2019\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock\nand stone till their hair whistled again.\n\nAs they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve\no\u2019clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the\nkiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears\nthat he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,\nbut she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last\nhe consented; but the moment she came to her father\u2019s house the guards\nawoke and he was taken prisoner again.\n\nThen he was brought before the king, and the king said, \u2018You shall never\nhave my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops\nthe view from my window.\u2019 Now this hill was so big that the whole world\ncould not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had\ndone very little, the fox came and said. \u2018Lie down and go to sleep; I\nwill work for you.\u2019 And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;\nso he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was\nremoved he must give him the princess.\n\nThen the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man\nand the princess; and the fox came and said to him, \u2018We will have all\nthree, the princess, the horse, and the bird.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the young man,\n\u2018that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?\u2019\n\n\u2018If you will only listen,\u2019 said the fox, \u2018it can be done. When you come\nto the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, \u201cHere\nshe is!\u201d Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden\nhorse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of\nthem; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on\nto the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as\nfast as you can.\u2019\n\nAll went right: then the fox said, \u2018When you come to the castle where\nthe bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will\nride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right\nhorse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that\nyou want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and\nwhen you get it into your hand, ride away.\u2019\n\nThis, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the\nprincess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox\ncame, and said, \u2018Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.\u2019 But the\nyoung man refused to do it: so the fox said, \u2018I will at any rate give\nyou good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,\nand sit down by the side of no river.\u2019 Then away he went. \u2018Well,\u2019\nthought the young man, \u2018it is no hard matter to keep that advice.\u2019\n\nHe rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where\nhe had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and\nuproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, \u2018Two men\nare going to be hanged.\u2019 As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were\nhis brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, \u2018Cannot they in any\nway be saved?\u2019 But the people said \u2018No,\u2019 unless he would bestow all his\nmoney upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to\nthink about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were\ngiven up, and went on with him towards their home.\n\nAnd as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\ncool and pleasant that the two brothers said, \u2018Let us sit down by the\nside of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.\u2019 So he said,\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 and forgot the fox\u2019s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\nriver; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\ndown the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went\nhome to the king their master, and said. \u2018All this have we won by our\nlabour.\u2019 Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not\neat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.\n\nThe youngest son fell to the bottom of the river\u2019s bed: luckily it was\nnearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep\nthat he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,\nand scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would\nhave befallen him: \u2018Yet,\u2019 said he, \u2018I cannot leave you here, so lay hold\nof my tail and hold fast.\u2019 Then he pulled him out of the river, and said\nto him, as he got upon the bank, \u2018Your brothers have set watch to kill\nyou, if they find you in the kingdom.\u2019 So he dressed himself as a poor\nman, and came secretly to the king\u2019s court, and was scarcely within the\ndoors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess\nleft off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his\nbrothers\u2019 roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the\nprincess given to him again; and after the king\u2019s death he was heir to\nhis kingdom.\n\nA long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox\nmet him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut\noff his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the\nfox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\nprincess, who had been lost a great many many years.", "Hans in Luck": "Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes\nright--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are\nswans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they\nwill always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so\nmuch the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as\nthey think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it\nknow about the matter?\n\nOne of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had\nworked hard for his master. At last he said, \u2018Master, my time is up; I\nmust go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages\nand let me go.\u2019 And the master said, \u2018You have been a faithful and good\nservant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.\u2019 Then he gave him a lump\nof silver as big as his head.\n\nHans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,\nthrew it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he\nwent lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,\ntrotting gaily along on a capital horse. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said Hans aloud, \u2018what a\nfine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy\nas if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no\nstones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.\u2019 Hans did\nnot speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, \u2018Well,\nfriend, why do you go on foot then?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018I have this load to\ncarry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can\u2019t hold up\nmy head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.\u2019 \u2018What do you say\nof making an exchange?\u2019 said the horseman. \u2018I will give you my horse,\nand you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of\ntrouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.\u2019 \u2018With all my\nheart,\u2019 said Hans: \u2018but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one\nthing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.\u2019\nHowever, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him\nthe bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, \u2018When\nyou want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry\n\u201cJip!\u201d\u2019\n\nHans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his\nelbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one\nminute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,\n\n \u2018No care and no sorrow,\n  A fig for the morrow!\n  We\u2019ll laugh and be merry,\n  Sing neigh down derry!\u2019\n\nAfter a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he\nsmacked his lips and cried \u2018Jip!\u2019 Away went the horse full gallop; and\nbefore Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his\nback by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who\nwas coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to\nhimself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the\nshepherd, \u2018This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon\na beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break\nhis neck. However, I\u2019m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great\ndeal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has\nspoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells\nnot very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one\u2019s leisure behind that\ncow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,\ninto the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said\nthe shepherd, \u2018if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your\nhorse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it\nmyself.\u2019 \u2018Done!\u2019 said Hans, merrily. \u2018What a noble heart that good man\nhas!\u2019 thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans\nand the cow good morning, and away he rode.\n\nHans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and\nthen drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky\none. \u2018If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be\nable to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with\nit; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what\ncan I wish for more?\u2019 When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his\nbread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had\nrested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother\u2019s\nvillage. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at\nlast, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than\nan hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue\nclave to the roof of his mouth. \u2018I can find a cure for this,\u2019 thought\nhe; \u2018now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst\u2019: so he tied her to the\nstump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop\nwas to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring\nhim milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had\nnot thought of looking to that.\n\nWhile he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\nclumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at\nlast gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he\nlay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a\npig in a wheelbarrow. \u2018What is the matter with you, my man?\u2019 said the\nbutcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he\nwas dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then\nthe butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, \u2018There, drink and refresh\nyourself; your cow will give you no milk: don\u2019t you see she is an old\nbeast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?\u2019 \u2018Alas, alas!\u2019 said\nHans, \u2018who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and\ngive me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate\ncow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like\nthat fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do\nsomething with it; it would at any rate make sausages.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said\nthe butcher, \u2018I don\u2019t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,\nneighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat\npig for the cow.\u2019 \u2018Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!\u2019\nsaid Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the\nwheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to\nits leg.\n\nSo on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met\nwith some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.\nHow could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at\nlast got?\n\nThe next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The\ncountryman stopped to ask what was o\u2019clock; this led to further chat;\nand Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and\nhow all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then\nbegan to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a\nchristening. \u2018Feel,\u2019 said he, \u2018how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight\nweeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,\nit has lived so well!\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 said Hans, as he weighed it in\nhis hand; \u2018but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.\u2019 Meantime the\ncountryman began to look grave, and shook his head. \u2018Hark ye!\u2019 said he,\n\u2018my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can\u2019t help doing\nyou a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I\njust came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was\ndreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire\u2019s pig. If\nyou have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least\nthey will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?\u2019\n\nPoor Hans was sadly frightened. \u2018Good man,\u2019 cried he, \u2018pray get me out\nof this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;\nbut he may have been the squire\u2019s for aught I can tell: you know this\ncountry better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.\u2019 \u2018I ought\nto have something into the bargain,\u2019 said the countryman; \u2018give a fat\ngoose for a pig, indeed! \u2018Tis not everyone would do so much for you as\nthat. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.\u2019 Then\nhe took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;\nwhile Hans went on the way homewards free from care. \u2018After all,\u2019\nthought he, \u2018that chap is pretty well taken in. I don\u2019t care whose pig\nit is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I\nhave much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;\nthen the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there\nare all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow,\nand then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my\nmother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.\u2019\n\nAs he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,\nworking and singing,\n\n \u2018O\u2019er hill and o\u2019er dale\n  So happy I roam,\n  Work light and live well,\n  All the world is my home;\n  Then who so blythe, so merry as I?\u2019\n\nHans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, \u2018You must be well\noff, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the\nother, \u2018mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand\ninto his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that\nbeautiful goose?\u2019 \u2018I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.\u2019 \u2018And where\ndid you get the pig?\u2019 \u2018I gave a cow for it.\u2019 \u2018And the cow?\u2019 \u2018I gave a\nhorse for it.\u2019 \u2018And the horse?\u2019 \u2018I gave a lump of silver as big as my\nhead for it.\u2019 \u2018And the silver?\u2019 \u2018Oh! I worked hard for that seven long\nyears.\u2019 \u2018You have thriven well in the world hitherto,\u2019 said the grinder,\n\u2018now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand\nin it, your fortune would be made.\u2019 \u2018Very true: but how is that to be\nmanaged?\u2019 \u2018How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,\u2019 said the other;\n\u2018you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one\nthat is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the\nvalue of your goose for it--will you buy?\u2019 \u2018How can you ask?\u2019 said\nHans; \u2018I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money\nwhenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there\u2019s\nthe goose.\u2019 \u2018Now,\u2019 said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone\nthat lay by his side, \u2018this is a most capital stone; do but work it well\nenough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.\u2019\n\nHans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes\nsparkled for joy, and he said to himself, \u2018Surely I must have been born\nin a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.\nPeople are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in\nletting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.\u2019\n\nMeantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his\nlast penny in his joy at getting the cow.\n\nAt last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he\ndragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of\nwater, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on\nthe bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a\nlittle, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.\n\nFor a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang\nup and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,\nwith tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,\nthe ugly heavy stone.\n\n\u2018How happy am I!\u2019 cried he; \u2018nobody was ever so lucky as I.\u2019 Then up he\ngot with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till\nhe reached his mother\u2019s house, and told her how very easy the road to\ngood luck was.", "Jorinda and Jorindel": "There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy\nwood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take\nany shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of\nan owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always\nbecame an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred\npaces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step\ntill she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given\nher his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came\nwithin that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her\ninto a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were\nseven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with\nbeautiful birds in them.\n\nNow there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier\nthan all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd\nlad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon\nto be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be\nalone; and Jorindel said, \u2018We must take care that we don\u2019t go too near\nto the fairy\u2019s castle.\u2019 It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the\nsetting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon\nthe green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall\nbirches.\n\nJorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and\nboth felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be\nparted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when\nthey looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves\nat a loss to know what path to take.\n\nThe sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind\nthe hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the\nbushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old\nwalls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.\nJorinda was just singing,\n\n \u2018The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\n  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!\n  He mourn\u2019d for the fate of his darling mate,\n  Well-a-day!\u2019\n\nwhen her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and\nbeheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended\nwith a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times\nround them, and three times screamed:\n\n \u2018Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!\u2019\n\nJorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither\nweep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;\nthe gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the\nold fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and\nchin that almost met one another.\n\nShe mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away\nwith it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but\nwhat could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot\nwhere he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse\nvoice:\n\n \u2018Till the prisoner is fast,\n  And her doom is cast,\n  There stay! Oh, stay!\n  When the charm is around her,\n  And the spell has bound her,\n  Hie away! away!\u2019\n\nOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees\nbefore the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but\nshe laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she\nwent her way.\n\nHe prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. \u2018Alas!\u2019 he said, \u2018what\nwill become of me?\u2019 He could not go back to his own home, so he went to\na strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time\ndid he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,\nbut all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.\n\nAt last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,\nand that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he\nplucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and\nthat everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\nfound his Jorinda again.\n\nIn the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for\nthis pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but\non the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple\nflower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly\npearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and\nnight, till he came again to the castle.\n\nHe walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become\nfixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.\nJorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with\nthe flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,\nand listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the\nchamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in\nthe seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and\nscreamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for\nthe flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at\nthe birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then\nshould he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to\ndo, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the\nbest of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched\nthe cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her\narms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when\nthey walked together in the wood.\n\nThen he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all\ntook their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were\nmarried, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many\nother lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy\u2019s\ncages by themselves, much longer than they liked.", "The Travelling Musicians": "An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him\na great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more\nunfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and\nbegan to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some\nmischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey\ntowards the great city, \u2018For there,\u2019 thought he, \u2018I may turn musician.\u2019\n\nAfter he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the\nroadside and panting as if he were tired. \u2018What makes you pant so, my\nfriend?\u2019 said the ass. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the dog, \u2018my master was going to\nknock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make\nmyself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to\nearn my livelihood?\u2019 \u2018Hark ye!\u2019 said the ass, \u2018I am going to the great\ncity to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can\ndo in the same way?\u2019 The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on\ntogether.\n\nThey had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the\nroad and making a most rueful face. \u2018Pray, my good lady,\u2019 said the ass,\n\u2018what\u2019s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!\u2019 \u2018Ah, me!\u2019\nsaid the cat, \u2018how can one be in good spirits when one\u2019s life is in\ndanger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my\nease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress\nlaid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky\nenough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.\u2019\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 said the ass, \u2018by all means go with us to the great city; you are\na good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.\u2019 The cat\nwas pleased with the thought, and joined the party.\n\nSoon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\nperched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.\n\u2018Bravo!\u2019 said the ass; \u2018upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what\nis all this about?\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 said the cock, \u2018I was just now saying that\nwe should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and\nthe cook don\u2019t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my\nhead tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming\non Sunday!\u2019 \u2018Heaven forbid!\u2019 said the ass, \u2018come with us Master\nChanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have\nyour head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we\nmay get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.\u2019 \u2018With all my\nheart,\u2019 said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.\n\nThey could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when\nnight came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid\nthemselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the\nbranches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he\nshould be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to\nhis custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to\nsee that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something\nbright and shining and calling to his companions said, \u2018There must be a\nhouse no great way off, for I see a light.\u2019 \u2018If that be the case,\u2019 said\nthe ass, \u2018we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the\nbest in the world!\u2019 \u2018Besides,\u2019 added the dog, \u2018I should not be the\nworse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.\u2019 So they walked off together\ntowards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew\nnear it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a\nhouse in which a gang of robbers lived.\n\nThe ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and\npeeped in. \u2018Well, Donkey,\u2019 said Chanticleer, \u2018what do you see?\u2019 \u2018What\ndo I see?\u2019 replied the ass. \u2018Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of\ngood things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.\u2019 \u2018That would\nbe a noble lodging for us,\u2019 said the cock. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the ass, \u2018if we\ncould only get in\u2019; so they consulted together how they should contrive\nto get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed\nhimself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the\nwindow; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog\u2019s\nshoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat\u2019s head. When\nall was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass\nbrayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then\nthey all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into\nthe room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The\nrobbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,\nhad now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,\nand scampered away as fast as they could.\n\nThe coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what\nthe robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected\nto eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they\nput out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to\nhis own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in\nthe yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the\ncat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the\ncock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all\nrather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.\n\nBut about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were\nout and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in\ntoo great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than\nthe rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he\nmarched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in\norder to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of\nthe cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to\nlight it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,\nand spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away\nhe ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the\nleg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the\ncock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At\nthis the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told\nthe captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at\nhim and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a\nknife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him\nin the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a\nclub, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,\n\u2018Throw the rascal up here!\u2019 After this the robbers never dared to go\nback to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters\nthat they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at\nthis very day.", "Old Sultan": "A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,\nand had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife\nwere standing together before the house the shepherd said, \u2018I will shoot\nold Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.\u2019 But his wife\nsaid, \u2018Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a\ngreat many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of\nhis days.\u2019 \u2018But what can we do with him?\u2019 said the shepherd, \u2018he has not\na tooth in his head, and the thieves don\u2019t care for him at all; to\nbe sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;\ntomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.\u2019\n\nPoor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd\nand his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think\ntomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good\nfriend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,\nand how his master meant to kill him in the morning. \u2018Make yourself\neasy,\u2019 said the wolf, \u2018I will give you some good advice. Your master,\nyou know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the\nfield; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down\nbehind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie\ndown close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come\nout of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as\nyou can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they\nwill think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you\nthat they will take care of you as long as you live.\u2019 The dog liked this\nplan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the\nchild a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan\nsoon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master\nand mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, \u2018Old\nSultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live\nand be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and\ngive him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on\nas long as he lives.\u2019 So from this time forward Sultan had all that he\ncould wish for.\n\nSoon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, \u2018Now, my\ngood fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way\nwhen I want to taste one of the old shepherd\u2019s fine fat sheep.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019\nsaid the Sultan; \u2018I will be true to my master.\u2019 However, the wolf\nthought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But\nSultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait\nfor him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for\na good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed\nhis locks for him finely.\n\nThen the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan \u2018an old rogue,\u2019 and\nswore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the\nboar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now\nSultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd\u2019s old\nthree-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped\nalong with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.\n\nThe wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they\nespied their enemies coming, and saw the cat\u2019s long tail standing\nstraight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to\nfight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up\na stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of\nfighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped\nup into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and\nwondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden\nhimself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of\nthem a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a\nmouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped\nup and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, \u2018Look up in the tree, there\nsits the one who is to blame.\u2019 So they looked up, and espied the wolf\nsitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,\nand would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of\nhimself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.", "The Straw, the Coal, and the Bean": "In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\nof beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and\nthat it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.\nWhen she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her\nobserving it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards\na burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw\nbegan and said: \u2018Dear friends, from whence do you come here?\u2019 The coal\nreplied: \u2018I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped\nby sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been\nburnt to ashes.\u2019 The bean said: \u2018I too have escaped with a whole skin,\nbut if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made\ninto broth without any mercy, like my comrades.\u2019 \u2018And would a better\nfate have fallen to my lot?\u2019 said the straw. \u2018The old woman has\ndestroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at\nonce, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.\u2019\n\n\u2018But what are we to do now?\u2019 said the coal.\n\n\u2018I think,\u2019 answered the bean, \u2018that as we have so fortunately escaped\ndeath, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\nmischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\nrepair to a foreign country.\u2019\n\nThe proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\ntogether. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\nno bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\nit. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: \u2018I will lay myself straight\nacross, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.\u2019 The straw\ntherefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,\nwho was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the\nnewly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the\nwater rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,\nand ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in\ntwo pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed\nwhen she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had\nprudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,\nwas unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would\nhave been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who\nwas travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.\nAs he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,\nand sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the\ntailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.", "Briar Rose": "A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,\nwhere there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had\nplenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of\ngood things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but\nthough they had been married many years they had no children, and this\ngrieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking\nby the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor\nlittle fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping\nand nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little\nfish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away\nit lifted its head out of the water and said, \u2018I know what your wish is,\nand it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will\nsoon have a daughter.\u2019 What the little fish had foretold soon came to\npass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king\ncould not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great\nfeast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked\nhis kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen\nsaid, \u2018I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good\nto our little daughter.\u2019 Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;\nbut as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat\nout of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.\nSo twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red\nshoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:\nand after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all\ntheir best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another\nbeauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the\nworld.\n\nJust as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in\nthe courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was\ncome, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a\nbroomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.\nNow, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and\nscolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her\nrevenge. So she cried out, \u2018The king\u2019s daughter shall, in her fifteenth\nyear, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.\u2019 Then the twelfth of\nthe friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and\nsaid that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its\nmischief; so her gift was, that the king\u2019s daughter, when the spindle\nwounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a\nhundred years.\n\nHowever, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from\nthe threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom\nshould be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven\nfairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so\nbeautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew\nher loved her.\n\nIt happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king\nand queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she\nroved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till\nat last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase\nending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when\nshe turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning\naway very busily. \u2018Why, how now, good mother,\u2019 said the princess; \u2018what\nare you doing there?\u2019 \u2018Spinning,\u2019 said the old lady, and nodded her\nhead, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. \u2018How prettily that\nlittle thing turns round!\u2019 said the princess, and took the spindle\nand began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the\nfairy\u2019s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell\ndown lifeless on the ground.\n\nHowever, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and\nthe king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,\nfell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in\nthe court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon\nthe walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to\nsleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a\ngoose upon it for the king\u2019s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was\nat that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box\non the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell\nasleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the\njug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.\n\nA large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it\nbecame higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded\nand hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But\nthere went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar\nRose (for so the king\u2019s daughter was called): so that, from time to\ntime, several kings\u2019 sons came, and tried to break through the thicket\ninto the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the\nthorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there\nthey stuck fast, and died wretchedly.\n\nAfter many, many years there came a king\u2019s son into that land: and an\nold man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful\npalace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,\nlay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard\nfrom his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to\nbreak through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and\ndied. Then the young prince said, \u2018All this shall not frighten me; I\nwill go and see this Briar Rose.\u2019 The old man tried to hinder him, but\nhe was bent upon going.\n\nNow that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came\nto the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through\nwhich he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.\nThen he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs\nasleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat\nthe pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he\ncame into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit\nwas standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going\nto drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be\nplucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as\nif she was going to beat the boy.\n\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\nevery breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened\nthe door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,\nfast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he\ncould not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.\nBut the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled\nupon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also\nawoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.\nAnd the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the\npigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and\nflew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in\nthe kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,\nwith the goose for the king\u2019s dinner upon it; the butler finished his\ndraught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave\nthe boy the box on his ear.\n\nAnd then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast\nwas given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.", "The Dog and the Sparrow": "A shepherd\u2019s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him\nsuffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he\ntook to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.\nOn the road he met a sparrow that said to him, \u2018Why are you so sad,\nmy friend?\u2019 \u2018Because,\u2019 said the dog, \u2018I am very very hungry, and have\nnothing to eat.\u2019 \u2018If that be all,\u2019 answered the sparrow, \u2018come with me\ninto the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.\u2019 So on they\nwent together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher\u2019s shop,\nthe sparrow said to the dog, \u2018Stand there a little while till I peck you\ndown a piece of meat.\u2019 So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having\nfirst looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she\npecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,\ntill at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled\naway with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. \u2018Well,\u2019 said\nthe sparrow, \u2018you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to\nthe next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.\u2019 When the dog had\neaten this too, the sparrow said to him, \u2018Well, my good friend, have you\nhad enough now?\u2019 \u2018I have had plenty of meat,\u2019 answered he, \u2018but I should\nlike to have a piece of bread to eat after it.\u2019 \u2018Come with me then,\u2019\nsaid the sparrow, \u2018and you shall soon have that too.\u2019 So she took him\nto a baker\u2019s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till\nthey fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to\nanother shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the\nsparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said he; \u2018and\nnow let us take a walk a little way out of the town.\u2019 So they both went\nout upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone\nfar before the dog said, \u2018I am very much tired--I should like to take a\nnap.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 answered the sparrow, \u2018do so, and in the meantime\nI will perch upon that bush.\u2019 So the dog stretched himself out on the\nroad, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with\na cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The\nsparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would\ngo on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called\nout, \u2018Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.\u2019 But the\ncarter, grumbling to himself, \u2018You make it the worse for me, indeed!\nwhat can you do?\u2019 cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor\ndog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. \u2018There,\u2019 cried the\nsparrow, \u2018thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now\nmind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.\u2019\n\u2018Do your worst, and welcome,\u2019 said the brute, \u2018what harm can you do me?\u2019\nand passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and\npecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then\nall the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked\nround, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.\n\u2018What an unlucky wretch I am!\u2019 cried he. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 said\nthe sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and\npecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,\nhe drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill\nher; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse\u2019s head\nwith such force, that he fell down dead. \u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019\ncried he. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 said the sparrow. And as the carter\nwent on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the\ncart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine\nran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, \u2018Miserable wretch\nthat I am!\u2019 But the sparrow answered, \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 and\nperched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The\ncarter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she\nflew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the\nspot. \u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 said he. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 said\nthe sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him\ntoo. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or\ncaring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his\nthird horse as he done the other two. \u2018Alas! miserable wretch that I\nam!\u2019 cried he. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 answered the sparrow as she flew\naway; \u2018now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.\u2019 The\ncarter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home\noverflowing with rage and vexation. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said he to his wife, \u2018what\nill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three\ndead.\u2019 \u2018Alas! husband,\u2019 replied she, \u2018and a wicked bird has come into\nthe house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am\nsure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it\nup at such a rate!\u2019 Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of\nbirds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the\nmidst of them. \u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 cried the carter; for he saw\nthat the corn was almost all gone. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 said the\nsparrow; \u2018thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!\u2019 and away she flew.\n\nThe carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down\ninto his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat\nhimself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat\non the outside of the window, and cried \u2018Carter! thy cruelty shall cost\nthee thy life!\u2019 With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,\nand threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the\nwindow. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and\ncried, \u2018Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!\u2019 Then he became mad and\nblind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he\ncleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter\nand his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,\nglasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without\ntouching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the\nwife said, \u2018Shall I kill her at once?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 cried he, \u2018that is letting\nher off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat\nher.\u2019 But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck\nand cried, \u2018Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!\u2019 With that he\ncould wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, \u2018Wife,\nstrike at the bird and kill her in my hand.\u2019 And the wife struck; but\nshe missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down\ndead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.", "The Twelve Dancing Princesses": "There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in\ntwelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were\nshut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite\nworn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody\ncould find out how it happened, or where they had been.\n\nThen the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could\ndiscover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses\ndanced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his\nwife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not\nsucceed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.\n\nA king\u2019s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was\ntaken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their\ntwelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;\nand, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door\nof his chamber was left open. But the king\u2019s son soon fell asleep; and\nwhen he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been\ndancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing\nhappened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be\ncut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,\nand all lost their lives in the same manner.\n\nNow it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle\nand could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king\nreigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,\nwho asked him where he was going. \u2018I hardly know where I am going, or\nwhat I had better do,\u2019 said the soldier; \u2018but I think I should like very\nwell to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time\nI might be a king.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said the old dame, \u2018that is no very hard\ntask: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the\nprincesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves\nyou pretend to be fast asleep.\u2019\n\nThen she gave him a cloak, and said, \u2018As soon as you put that on\nyou will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the\nprincesses wherever they go.\u2019 When the soldier heard all this good\ncounsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said\nhe was willing to undertake the task.\n\nHe was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered\nfine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led\nto the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of\nthe princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all\naway secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself\ndown on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if\nhe was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed\nheartily; and the eldest said, \u2018This fellow too might have done a wiser\nthing than lose his life in this way!\u2019 Then they rose up and opened\ntheir drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and\ndressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager\nto begin dancing. But the youngest said, \u2018I don\u2019t know how it is, while\nyou are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will\nbefall us.\u2019 \u2018You simpleton,\u2019 said the eldest, \u2018you are always afraid;\nhave you forgotten how many kings\u2019 sons have already watched in vain?\nAnd as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping\ndraught, he would have slept soundly enough.\u2019\n\nWhen they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he\nsnored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were\nquite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,\nand the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier\nsaw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest\nleading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put\non the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;\nbut in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest\nprincess, and she cried out to her sisters, \u2018All is not right; someone\ntook hold of my gown.\u2019 \u2018You silly creature!\u2019 said the eldest, \u2018it is\nnothing but a nail in the wall.\u2019 Then down they all went, and at the\nbottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and\nthe leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.\nThe soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke\noff a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the\nyoungest daughter said again, \u2018I am sure all is not right--did not you\nhear that noise? That never happened before.\u2019 But the eldest said, \u2018It\nis only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.\u2019\n\nThen they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of\ngold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering\ndiamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there\nwas a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but\nthe eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.\nSo they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the\nlake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,\nwho seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.\n\nOne of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into\nthe same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the\nprince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier\nsaid, \u2018I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might\nwe do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat\nseems very heavy today.\u2019 \u2018It is only the heat of the weather,\u2019 said the\nprincess: \u2018I feel it very warm too.\u2019\n\nOn the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from\nwhich came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,\nand went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and\nthe soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and\nwhen any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it\nall up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,\ntoo, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always\nsilenced her. They danced on till three o\u2019clock in the morning, and then\nall their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.\nThe princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the\nsoldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the\nopposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising\nto come again the next night.\n\nWhen they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,\nand laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very\nmuch tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, \u2018Now all\nis quite safe\u2019; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine\nclothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the\nsoldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more\nof this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;\nand every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time\ntill their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,\non the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a\ntoken of where he had been.\n\nAs soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken\nbefore the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the\ntwelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would\nsay. And when the king asked him. \u2018Where do my twelve daughters dance at\nnight?\u2019 he answered, \u2018With twelve princes in a castle under ground.\u2019 And\nthen he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three\nbranches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king\ncalled for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said\nwas true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was\nof no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king\nasked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he\nanswered, \u2018I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.\u2019--And they\nwere married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king\u2019s\nheir.", "The Fisherman and His Wife": "There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close\nby the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and\none day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling\nwaves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away\ndeep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.\nBut the fish said, \u2018Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an\nenchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!\u2019 \u2018Oh, ho!\u2019\nsaid the man, \u2018you need not make so many words about the matter; I will\nhave nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon\nas you please!\u2019 Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted\nstraight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him\non the wave.\n\nWhen the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how\nhe had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted\nprince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. \u2018Did not\nyou ask it for anything?\u2019 said the wife, \u2018we live very wretchedly here,\nin this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug\nlittle cottage.\u2019\n\nThe fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the\nseashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and\ngreen. And he stood at the water\u2019s edge, and said:\n\n \u2018O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\n\nThen the fish came swimming to him, and said, \u2018Well, what is her will?\nWhat does your wife want?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018she says that when\nI had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let\nyou go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants\na snug little cottage.\u2019 \u2018Go home, then,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is in the\ncottage already!\u2019 So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the\ndoor of a nice trim little cottage. \u2018Come in, come in!\u2019 said she; \u2018is\nnot this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?\u2019 And there was a\nparlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there\nwas a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and\nthere was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the\nfisherman, \u2018how happily we shall live now!\u2019 \u2018We will try to do so, at\nleast,\u2019 said his wife.\n\nEverything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,\n\u2018Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the\ncourtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to\nhave a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him\nto give us a castle.\u2019 \u2018Wife,\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018I don\u2019t like to go to\nhim again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this\npretty cottage to live in.\u2019 \u2018Nonsense!\u2019 said the wife; \u2018he will do it\nvery willingly, I know; go along and try!\u2019\n\nThe fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to\nthe sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went\nclose to the edge of the waves, and said:\n\n \u2018O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, what does she want now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the man,\ndolefully, \u2018my wife wants to live in a stone castle.\u2019 \u2018Go home, then,\u2019\nsaid the fish; \u2018she is standing at the gate of it already.\u2019 So away went\nthe fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great\ncastle. \u2018See,\u2019 said she, \u2018is not this grand?\u2019 With that they went into\nthe castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the\nrooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and\nbehind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a\nmile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the\ncourtyard were stables and cow-houses. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the man, \u2018now we\nwill live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of\nour lives.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps we may,\u2019 said the wife; \u2018but let us sleep upon it,\nbefore we make up our minds to that.\u2019 So they went to bed.\n\nThe next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and\nshe jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, \u2018Get up, husband,\nand bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.\u2019 \u2018Wife, wife,\u2019\nsaid the man, \u2018why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.\u2019\n\u2018Then I will,\u2019 said she. \u2018But, wife,\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018how can you\nbe king--the fish cannot make you a king?\u2019 \u2018Husband,\u2019 said she, \u2018say\nno more about it, but go and try! I will be king.\u2019 So the man went away\nquite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time\nthe sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves\nand the ridges of foam as he cried out:\n\n \u2018O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, what would she have now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the poor\nman, \u2018my wife wants to be king.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is king\nalready.\u2019\n\nThen the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw\na troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when\nhe went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,\nwith a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six\nfair maidens, each a head taller than the other. \u2018Well, wife,\u2019 said the\nfisherman, \u2018are you king?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am king.\u2019 And when he had\nlooked at her for a long time, he said, \u2018Ah, wife! what a fine thing it\nis to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long\nas we live.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know how that may be,\u2019 said she; \u2018never is a long\ntime. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I\nthink I should like to be emperor.\u2019 \u2018Alas, wife! why should you wish to\nbe emperor?\u2019 said the fisherman. \u2018Husband,\u2019 said she, \u2018go to the fish!\nI say I will be emperor.\u2019 \u2018Ah, wife!\u2019 replied the fisherman, \u2018the fish\ncannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for\nsuch a thing.\u2019 \u2018I am king,\u2019 said Ilsabill, \u2018and you are my slave; so go\nat once!\u2019\n\nSo the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,\n\u2018This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be\ntired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.\u2019 He\nsoon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and\na mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he\nwent as near as he could to the water\u2019s brink, and said:\n\n \u2018O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\n\n\u2018What would she have now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the fisherman,\n\u2018she wants to be emperor.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is emperor\nalready.\u2019\n\nSo he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill\nsitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on\nher head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards\nand attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the\ntallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And\nbefore her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went\nup to her and said, \u2018Wife, are you emperor?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am\nemperor.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the man, as he gazed upon her, \u2018what a fine thing\nit is to be emperor!\u2019 \u2018Husband,\u2019 said she, \u2018why should we stop at being\nemperor? I will be pope next.\u2019 \u2018O wife, wife!\u2019 said he, \u2018how can you be\npope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.\u2019 \u2018Husband,\u2019 said\nshe, \u2018I will be pope this very day.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 replied the husband, \u2018the\nfish cannot make you pope.\u2019 \u2018What nonsense!\u2019 said she; \u2018if he can make\nan emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.\u2019\n\nSo the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging\nand the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were\nin trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the\nmiddle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards\nthe south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight\nthe fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his\nknees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and\nsaid:\n\n \u2018O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\n\n\u2018What does she want now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018my\nwife wants to be pope.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is pope already.\u2019\n\nThen the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne\nthat was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and\naround her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side\nof her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as\nlarge as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no\nlarger than a small rushlight. \u2018Wife,\u2019 said the fisherman, as he looked\nat all this greatness, \u2018are you pope?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am pope.\u2019\n\u2018Well, wife,\u2019 replied he, \u2018it is a grand thing to be pope; and now\nyou must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.\u2019 \u2018I will think about\nthat,\u2019 said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not\nsleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she\nwas dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. \u2018Ha!\u2019 thought she,\nas she woke up and looked at it through the window, \u2018after all I cannot\nprevent the sun rising.\u2019 At this thought she was very angry, and wakened\nher husband, and said, \u2018Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must\nbe lord of the sun and moon.\u2019 The fisherman was half asleep, but the\nthought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.\n\u2018Alas, wife!\u2019 said he, \u2018cannot you be easy with being pope?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019\nsaid she, \u2018I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my\nleave. Go to the fish at once!\u2019\n\nThen the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to\nthe shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks\nshook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the\nlightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in\nthe sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of\nwhite foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,\nand cried out, as well as he could:\n\n \u2018O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\u2019\n\n\u2018What does she want now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018she wants to\nbe lord of the sun and moon.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish, \u2018to your pigsty\nagain.\u2019\n\nAnd there they live to this very day.", "The Willow-Wren and the Bear": "Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,\nand the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: \u2018Brother\nwolf, what bird is it that sings so well?\u2019 \u2018That is the King of birds,\u2019\nsaid the wolf, \u2018before whom we must bow down.\u2019 In reality the bird was\nthe willow-wren. \u2018IF that\u2019s the case,\u2019 said the bear, \u2018I should very\nmuch like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.\u2019 \u2018That is not\ndone quite as you seem to think,\u2019 said the wolf; \u2018you must wait until\nthe Queen comes,\u2019 Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in\nher beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young\nones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him\nback by the sleeve, and said: \u2018No, you must wait until the lord and lady\nQueen have gone away again.\u2019 So they took stock of the hole where the\nnest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he\nhad seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it\nagain. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw\nfive or six young ones lying there. \u2018Is that the royal palace?\u2019 cried\nthe bear; \u2018it is a wretched palace, and you are not King\u2019s children, you\nare disreputable children!\u2019 When the young wrens heard that, they were\nfrightfully angry, and screamed: \u2018No, that we are not! Our parents are\nhonest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!\u2019\n\nThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\nholes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and\nwhen their parents again brought food they said: \u2018We will not so much as\ntouch one fly\u2019s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have\nsettled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been\nhere and has insulted us!\u2019 Then the old King said: \u2018Be easy, he shall\nbe punished,\u2019 and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear\u2019s cave, and\ncalled in: \u2018Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall\nsuffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.\u2019 Thus war was\nannounced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take\npart in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth\ncontained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the\nair, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and\nflies had to come.\n\nWhen the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies\nto discover who was the enemy\u2019s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was\nthe most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,\nand hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be\nannounced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him\nand said: \u2018Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be\ngeneral and lead us.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 said the fox, \u2018but what signal shall we\nagree upon?\u2019 No one knew that, so the fox said: \u2018I have a fine long\nbushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift\nmy tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I\nlet it hang down, run away as fast as you can.\u2019 When the gnat had heard\nthat, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest\ndetail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,\nall the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the\nearth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through\nthe air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one\nwas uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each\nother. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle\nbeneath the fox\u2019s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt\nthe first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but\nhe bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second\nsting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could\nhold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When\nthe animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each\ninto his hole, and the birds had won the battle.\n\nThen the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:\n\u2018Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart\u2019s content, we have won\nthe battle!\u2019 But the young wrens said: \u2018We will not eat yet, the bear\nmust come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable\nchildren, before we will do that.\u2019 Then the willow-wren flew to the\nbear\u2019s hole and cried: \u2018Growler, you are to come to the nest to my\nchildren, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall\nbe broken.\u2019 So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged\ntheir pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat\ndown together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the\nnight.", "The Frog-Prince": "One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went\nout to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool\nspring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down\nto rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her\nfavourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and\ncatching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that\nshe missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled\nalong upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The\nprincess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so\ndeep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail\nher loss, and said, \u2018Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would\ngive all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the\nworld.\u2019\n\nWhilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,\n\u2018Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 said she, \u2018what can you\ndo for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.\u2019\nThe frog said, \u2018I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;\nbut if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off\nyour golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball\nagain.\u2019 \u2018What nonsense,\u2019 thought the princess, \u2018this silly frog is\ntalking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though\nhe may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he\nshall have what he asks.\u2019 So she said to the frog, \u2018Well, if you will\nbring me my ball, I will do all you ask.\u2019 Then the frog put his head\ndown, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came\nup again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the\nspring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick\nit up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she\nnever thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.\nThe frog called after her, \u2018Stay, princess, and take me with you as you\nsaid,\u2019 But she did not stop to hear a word.\n\nThe next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\nstrange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the\nmarble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the\ndoor, and a little voice cried out and said:\n\n \u2018Open the door, my princess dear,\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\u2019\n\nThen the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw\nthe frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly\nfrightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her\nseat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,\nasked her what was the matter. \u2018There is a nasty frog,\u2019 said she, \u2018at\nthe door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I\ntold him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never\nget out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come\nin.\u2019\n\nWhile she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\n\n \u2018Open the door, my princess dear,\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\u2019\n\nThen the king said to the young princess, \u2018As you have given your word\nyou must keep it; so go and let him in.\u2019 She did so, and the frog hopped\ninto the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the\nbottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where\nthe princess sat. \u2018Pray lift me upon chair,\u2019 said he to the princess,\n\u2018and let me sit next to you.\u2019 As soon as she had done this, the frog\nsaid, \u2018Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.\u2019 This\nshe did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, \u2018Now I am\ntired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.\u2019 And the princess,\nthough very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the\npillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was\nlight he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.\n\u2018Now, then,\u2019 thought the princess, \u2018at last he is gone, and I shall be\ntroubled with him no more.\u2019\n\nBut she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same\ntapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\n\n \u2018Open the door, my princess dear,\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\u2019\n\nAnd when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon\nher pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did\nthe same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\nastonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her\nwith the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head\nof her bed.\n\nHe told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\nchanged him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till\nsome princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from\nher plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. \u2018You,\u2019 said the\nprince, \u2018have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for\nbut that you should go with me into my father\u2019s kingdom, where I will\nmarry you, and love you as long as you live.\u2019\n\nThe young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying \u2018Yes\u2019 to\nall this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful\nhorses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind\nthe coach rode the prince\u2019s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed\nthe misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\nbitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\n\nThey then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\nhorses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince\u2019s\nkingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great\nmany years.", "Cat and Mouse in Partnership": "A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\nto her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\nlength the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\n\u2018But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer\nfrom hunger,\u2019 said the cat; \u2018and you, little mouse, cannot venture\neverywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.\u2019 The good advice\nwas followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where\nto put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: \u2018I know no\nplace where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\ndares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,\nand not touch it until we are really in need of it.\u2019 So the pot was\nplaced in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great\nyearning for it, and said to the mouse: \u2018I want to tell you something,\nlittle mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has\nasked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold\nhim over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look\nafter the house by yourself.\u2019 \u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 answered the mouse, \u2018by all\nmeans go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I\nshould like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.\u2019 All this,\nhowever, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to\nbe godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,\nbegan to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a\nwalk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then\nstretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought\nof the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.\n\u2018Well, here you are again,\u2019 said the mouse, \u2018no doubt you have had a\nmerry day.\u2019 \u2018All went off well,\u2019 answered the cat. \u2018What name did they\ngive the child?\u2019 \u2018Top off!\u2019 said the cat quite coolly. \u2018Top off!\u2019 cried\nthe mouse, \u2018that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in\nyour family?\u2019 \u2018What does that matter,\u2019 said the cat, \u2018it is no worse\nthan Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.\u2019\n\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to\nthe mouse: \u2018You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for\na day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a\nwhite ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.\u2019 The good mouse consented,\nbut the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured\nhalf the pot of fat. \u2018Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to\noneself,\u2019 said she, and was quite satisfied with her day\u2019s work. When\nshe went home the mouse inquired: \u2018And what was the child christened?\u2019\n\u2018Half-done,\u2019 answered the cat. \u2018Half-done! What are you saying? I\nnever heard the name in my life, I\u2019ll wager anything it is not in the\ncalendar!\u2019\n\nThe cat\u2019s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. \u2018All good\nthings go in threes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am asked to stand godmother again.\nThe child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that\nexception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only\nhappens once every few years, you will let me go, won\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Top-off!\nHalf-done!\u2019 answered the mouse, \u2018they are such odd names, they make me\nvery thoughtful.\u2019 \u2018You sit at home,\u2019 said the cat, \u2018in your dark-grey\nfur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that\u2019s because\nyou do not go out in the daytime.\u2019 During the cat\u2019s absence the mouse\ncleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely\nemptied the pot of fat. \u2018When everything is eaten up one has some\npeace,\u2019 said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return\nhome till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to\nthe third child. \u2018It will not please you more than the others,\u2019 said the\ncat. \u2018He is called All-gone.\u2019 \u2018All-gone,\u2019 cried the mouse \u2018that is the\nmost suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;\nwhat can that mean?\u2019 and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay\ndown to sleep.\n\nFrom this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but\nwhen the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found\noutside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: \u2018Come, cat,\nwe will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we\nshall enjoy that.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered the cat, \u2018you will enjoy it as much\nas you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the\nwindow.\u2019 They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of\nfat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the\nmouse, \u2018now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true\nfriend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First\ntop off, then half-done, then--\u2019 \u2018Will you hold your tongue,\u2019 cried the\ncat, \u2018one word more, and I will eat you too.\u2019 \u2018All-gone\u2019 was already on\nthe poor mouse\u2019s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang\non her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of\nthe world.", "The Goose-Girl": "The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their\nonly child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her\nmother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good\nfairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch\nover her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a\ngreat way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she\ngot ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her\nmother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and\nsilver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a\nroyal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give\nher into the bridegroom\u2019s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.\nNow the princess\u2019s horse was the fairy\u2019s gift, and it was called Falada,\nand could speak.\n\nWhen the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her\nbed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,\nand gave it to the princess, and said, \u2018Take care of it, dear child; for\nit is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.\u2019 Then they all took\na sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into\nher bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her\nbridegroom\u2019s kingdom.\n\nOne day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to\nfeel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, \u2018Pray get down, and fetch\nme some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to\ndrink.\u2019 \u2018Nay,\u2019 said the maid, \u2018if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and\nstoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any\nlonger.\u2019 Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the\nlittle brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out\nher golden cup; and she wept and said, \u2018Alas! what will become of me?\u2019\nAnd the lock answered her, and said:\n\n \u2018Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\u2019\n\nBut the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\nmaid\u2019s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.\n\nThen all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and\nthe sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;\nand at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid\u2019s rude\nspeech, and said, \u2018Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in\nmy golden cup.\u2019 But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily\nthan before: \u2018Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.\u2019\nThen the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay\ndown, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,\n\u2018What will become of me?\u2019 And the lock of hair answered her again:\n\n \u2018Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\u2019\n\nAnd as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,\nand floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did\nnot see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the\ncharm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that\nshe had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would\nhave got upon Falada again, the maid said, \u2018I shall ride upon Falada,\nand you may have my horse instead\u2019; so she was forced to give up her\nhorse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her\nmaid\u2019s shabby ones.\n\nAt last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\nservant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had\nhappened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.\n\nThen the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the\nother horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the\nroyal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to\nmeet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one\nwho was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;\nbut the true princess was told to stay in the court below.\n\nNow the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\namused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was\ngoing on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,\nand too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber\nto ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left\nstanding in the court below. \u2018I brought her with me for the sake of her\ncompany on the road,\u2019 said she; \u2018pray give the girl some work to do,\nthat she may not be idle.\u2019 The old king could not for some time think\nof any work for her to do; but at last he said, \u2018I have a lad who takes\ncare of my geese; she may go and help him.\u2019 Now the name of this lad,\nthat the real bride was to help in watching the king\u2019s geese, was\nCurdken.\n\nBut the false bride said to the prince, \u2018Dear husband, pray do me one\npiece of kindness.\u2019 \u2018That I will,\u2019 said the prince. \u2018Then tell one of\nyour slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it\nwas very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road\u2019; but the truth was,\nshe was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and\ntell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the\nfaithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she\nwept, and begged the man to nail up Falada\u2019s head against a large\ndark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning\nand evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the\nslaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and\nnailed it up under the dark gate.\n\nEarly the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,\nshe said sorrowfully:\n\n \u2018Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\u2019\n\nand the head answered:\n\n \u2018Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\u2019\n\nThen they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she\ncame to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her\nwaving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken\nsaw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the\nlocks out, but she cried:\n\n \u2018Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let Curdken\u2019s hat go!\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let him after it go!\n  O\u2019er hills, dales, and rocks,\n  Away be it whirl\u2019d\n  Till the silvery locks\n  Are all comb\u2019d and curl\u2019d!\n\nThen there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken\u2019s hat; and\naway it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after\nit; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her\nhair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,\nand would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it\ngrew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.\n\nThe next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor\ngirl looked up at Falada\u2019s head, and cried:\n\n \u2018Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\u2019\n\nand the head answered:\n\n \u2018Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\u2019\n\nThen she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began\nto comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to\ntake hold of it; but she cried out quickly:\n\n \u2018Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let Curdken\u2019s hat go!\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let him after it go!\n  O\u2019er hills, dales, and rocks,\n  Away be it whirl\u2019d\n  Till the silvery locks\n  Are all comb\u2019d and curl\u2019d!\n\nThen the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,\nover the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when\nhe came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they\nwatched the geese till it grew dark.\n\nIn the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and\nsaid, \u2018I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any\nlonger.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 said the king. \u2018Because, instead of doing any good, she\ndoes nothing but tease me all day long.\u2019 Then the king made him tell him\nwhat had happened. And Curdken said, \u2018When we go in the morning through\nthe dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head\nof a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:\n\n \u2018Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\u2019\n\nand the head answers:\n\n \u2018Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\u2019\n\nAnd Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow\nwhere the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced\nto run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the\nold king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning\ncame, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke\nto Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and\nhid himself in a bush by the meadow\u2019s side; and he soon saw with his own\neyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,\nshe let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her\nsay:\n\n \u2018Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let Curdken\u2019s hat go!\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let him after it go!\n  O\u2019er hills, dales, and rocks,\n  Away be it whirl\u2019d\n  Till the silvery locks\n  Are all comb\u2019d and curl\u2019d!\n\nAnd soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken\u2019s hat, and away\nwent Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her\nhair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and\nwhen the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,\nand asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, \u2018That\nI must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.\u2019\n\nBut the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told\nhim all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very\nlucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered\nroyal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was\nso beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a\nfalse bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true\nbride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and\nheard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to\nthe false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all\nhis court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one\nside, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her\nbeauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all\nlike the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.\n\nWhen they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said\nhe would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the\nprincess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the\ntrue waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would\nbehave thus. \u2018Nothing better,\u2019 said this false bride, \u2018than that she\nshould be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that\ntwo white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to\nstreet till she was dead.\u2019 \u2018Thou art she!\u2019 said the old king; \u2018and as\nthou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.\u2019 And the young\nking was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the\nkingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came\nto see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.", "The Adventures of Chanticleer and Partlet": "1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS\n\n\u2018The nuts are quite ripe now,\u2019 said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\n\u2018suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\nbefore the squirrel takes them all away.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said\nPartlet, \u2018let us go and make a holiday of it together.\u2019\n\nSo they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\nthere till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many\nnuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,\nI do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not\nbecome them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little\ncarriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into\nit and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her\nhome. \u2018That\u2019s a good joke!\u2019 said Chanticleer; \u2018no, that will never do;\nI had rather by half walk home; I\u2019ll sit on the box and be coachman,\nif you like, but I\u2019ll not draw.\u2019 While this was passing, a duck came\nquacking up and cried out, \u2018You thieving vagabonds, what business have\nyou in my grounds? I\u2019ll give it you well for your insolence!\u2019 and upon\nthat she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no\ncoward, and returned the duck\u2019s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely\nthat she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her\nupon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she\nagreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, \u2018Now,\nduck, get on as fast as you can.\u2019 And away they went at a pretty good\npace.\n\nAfter they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin\nwalking together along the road: and the needle cried out, \u2018Stop, stop!\u2019\nand said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such\ndirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his\nfriend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat\ndrinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore\nthat the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their\ncarriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not\nlikely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them\npromise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to\ntread on Partlet\u2019s toes.\n\nLate at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in\nthe dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good\ndeal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their\nquarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his\nhouse was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:\nhowever, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet\nhad laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in\nthe habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and\nthey bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.\n\nEarly in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\nstirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the\negg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the\nfireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,\nand seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord\u2019s easy chair\nand the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept\naway as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open\nair in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran\nclose by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.\n\nAn hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief\nto wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he\nwalked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he\nstirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.\n\u2018Bless me!\u2019 said he, \u2018all the world seems to have a design against my\nhead this morning\u2019: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his\neasy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the\npain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and,\nsuspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look\nafter them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again\nwould take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no\nreckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.\n\n\n2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\n\nAnother day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;\nso Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\nharnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,\nand away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, \u2018Where\nare you going?\u2019 And Chanticleer replied,\n\n \u2018All on our way\n  A visit to pay\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.\u2019\n\nThen the cat said, \u2018Take me with you,\u2019 Chanticleer said, \u2018With all my\nheart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.\u2019\n\n \u2018Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\n  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!\n  Now, mice, be ready,\n  And, wheels, run steady!\n  For we are going a visit to pay\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.\u2019\n\nSoon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and\nChanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with\nthem.\n\nWhen they arrived at Mr Korbes\u2019s house, he was not at home; so the mice\ndrew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew\nupon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\nthe washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\nmillstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\nup in the towel.\n\nWhen Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\nthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\nwash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and\nwhen he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all\nover his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his\nsupper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into\nhis cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have\nrun out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell\ndown on his head, and killed him on the spot.\n\n\n3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\n\nAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains\nto eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found\nshould be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large\nnut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to\nherself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it\nstuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to\nChanticleer, \u2018Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I\nshall be choked.\u2019 Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and\nsaid, \u2018River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and\nwill be choked by a great nut.\u2019 The river said, \u2018Run first to the bride,\nand ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.\u2019 Chanticleer ran to\nthe bride, and said, \u2018Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then\nthe river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who\nlies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.\u2019 But the bride\nsaid, \u2018Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow\nin the garden.\u2019 Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland\nfrom the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then\nthe bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to\nthe river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to\nPartlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay\nquite dead, and never moved any more.\n\nThen Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\ncame and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little\nhearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\nthemselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they\nmet the fox. \u2018Where are you going, Chanticleer?\u2019 said he. \u2018To bury my\nPartlet,\u2019 said the other. \u2018May I go with you?\u2019 said the fox. \u2018Yes; but\nyou must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.\u2019 Then\nthe fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and\nall the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.\n\nSo on they went till they came to a rapid stream. \u2018How shall we get\nover?\u2019 said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, \u2018I will lay myself across,\nand you may pass over upon me.\u2019 But as the mice were going over, the\nstraw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in\nand were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came\nand said, \u2018I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you\nshall pass over upon me.\u2019 So he laid himself down; but they managed\nso clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the\nstream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly\noffered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;\nand this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and\nmanaged to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,\nwho were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water\nand were all carried away by the stream and drowned.\n\nThus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug\na grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.\nThen he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he\ndied too; and so all were dead.", "Rapunzel": "There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a\nchild. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.\nThese people had a little window at the back of their house from which\na splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\nflowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no\none dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\ngreat power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was\nstanding by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a\nbed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it\nlooked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,\nand began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and\nasked: \u2018What ails you, dear wife?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 she replied, \u2018if I can\u2019t eat\nsome of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall\ndie.\u2019 The man, who loved her, thought: \u2018Sooner than let your wife die,\nbring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.\u2019\nAt twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the\nenchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his\nwife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It\ntasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it\nthree times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband\nmust once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening\ntherefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the\nwall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before\nhim. \u2018How can you dare,\u2019 said she with angry look, \u2018descend into my\ngarden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 answered he, \u2018let mercy take the place of justice, I only made\nup my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the\nwindow, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she\nhad not got some to eat.\u2019 Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be\nsoftened, and said to him: \u2018If the case be as you say, I will allow\nyou to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\ncondition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into\nthe world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a\nmother.\u2019 The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the\nwoman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the\nchild the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\n\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was\ntwelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in\na forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a\nlittle window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself\nbeneath it and cried:\n\n \u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n  Let down your hair to me.\u2019\n\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she\nheard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,\nwound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair\nfell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\n\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the king\u2019s son rode through\nthe forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so\ncharming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her\nsolitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king\u2019s\nson wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,\nbut none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply\ntouched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and\nlistened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw\nthat an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\n\n \u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n  Let down your hair to me.\u2019\n\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress\nclimbed up to her. \u2018If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too\nwill try my fortune,\u2019 said he, and the next day when it began to grow\ndark, he went to the tower and cried:\n\n \u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n  Let down your hair to me.\u2019\n\nImmediately the hair fell down and the king\u2019s son climbed up.\n\nAt first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes\nhad never yet beheld, came to her; but the king\u2019s son began to talk to\nher quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred\nthat it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.\nThen Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take\nhim for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she\nthought: \u2018He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does\u2019; and she said\nyes, and laid her hand in his. She said: \u2018I will willingly go away with\nyou, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk\nevery time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when\nthat is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.\u2019 They\nagreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\nold woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until\nonce Rapunzel said to her: \u2018Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that\nyou are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king\u2019s son--he\nis with me in a moment.\u2019 \u2018Ah! you wicked child,\u2019 cried the enchantress.\n\u2018What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all\nthe world, and yet you have deceived me!\u2019 In her anger she clutched\nRapunzel\u2019s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand,\nseized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut\noff, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless\nthat she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great\ngrief and misery.\n\nOn the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress\nfastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the\nwindow, and when the king\u2019s son came and cried:\n\n \u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n  Let down your hair to me.\u2019\n\nshe let the hair down. The king\u2019s son ascended, but instead of finding\nhis dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with\nwicked and venomous looks. \u2018Aha!\u2019 she cried mockingly, \u2018you would fetch\nyour dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;\nthe cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is\nlost to you; you will never see her again.\u2019 The king\u2019s son was beside\nhimself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He\nescaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his\neyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but\nroots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of\nhis dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at\nlength came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she\nhad given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a\nvoice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and\nwhen he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two\nof her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could\nsee with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was\njoyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and\ncontented.", "Fundevogel": "There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as\nhe entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were\nthere. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at\nthe top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen\nasleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in\nher arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.\n\nThe forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:\n\u2018You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.\u2019 He\ntook it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the\none, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird\nhad carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that\nwhen they did not see each other they were sad.\n\nNow the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and\nbegan to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out\nto the spring. Lina saw this and said, \u2018Listen, old Sanna, why are you\nfetching so much water?\u2019 \u2018If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will\ntell you why.\u2019 So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,\nand then the cook said: \u2018Early tomorrow morning, when the forester\nis out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the\nkettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.\u2019\n\nEarly next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he\nwas gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel:\n\u2018If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.\u2019 Fundevogel\nsaid: \u2018Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.\u2019 Then said Lina: \u2018Then\nwill I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water\ninto the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said\nthat if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early\ntomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle\nfull of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up\nquickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.\u2019\n\nThe two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went\naway. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the\nbedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,\nand went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly\nalarmed, and she said to herself: \u2018What shall I say now when the\nforester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be\nfollowed instantly to get them back again.\u2019\n\nThen the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\novertake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the\nforest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina\nsaid to Fundevogel: \u2018Never leave me, and I will never leave you.\u2019\nFundevogel said: \u2018Neither now, nor ever.\u2019 Then said Lina: \u2018Do you become\na rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.\u2019 When the three servants came to\nthe forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but\nthe children were nowhere. Then said they: \u2018There is nothing to be done\nhere,\u2019 and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing\nin the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the\nold cook scolded and said: \u2018You simpletons, you should have cut the\nrose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with\nyou; go, and do it at once.\u2019 They had therefore to go out and look for\nthe second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.\nThen Lina said: \u2018Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave\nyou.\u2019 Fundevogel said: \u2018Neither now; nor ever.\u2019 Said Lina: \u2018Then do you\nbecome a church, and I\u2019ll be the chandelier in it.\u2019 So when the three\nservants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in\nit. They said therefore to each other: \u2018What can we do here, let us go\nhome.\u2019 When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;\nso they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a\nchandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: \u2018You fools! why\ndid you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home\nwith you?\u2019 And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with\nthe three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,\nsaw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling\nafter them. Then said Lina: \u2018Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will\nnever leave you.\u2019 Then said Fundevogel: \u2018Neither now, nor ever.\u2019\nSaid Lina: \u2018Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.\u2019 The cook,\nhowever, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,\nand was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized\nher head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old\nwitch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were\nheartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.", "The Valiant Little Tailor": "One summer\u2019s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the\nwindow; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came\na peasant woman down the street crying: \u2018Good jams, cheap! Good jams,\ncheap!\u2019 This rang pleasantly in the tailor\u2019s ears; he stretched his\ndelicate head out of the window, and called: \u2018Come up here, dear woman;\nhere you will get rid of your goods.\u2019 The woman came up the three steps\nto the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots\nfor him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and\nat length said: \u2018The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four\nounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no\nconsequence.\u2019 The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him\nwhat he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. \u2018Now, this jam\nshall be blessed by God,\u2019 cried the little tailor, \u2018and give me health\nand strength\u2019; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself\na piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. \u2018This won\u2019t\ntaste bitter,\u2019 said he, \u2018but I will just finish the jacket before I\ntake a bite.\u2019 He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made\nbigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam\nrose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were\nattracted and descended on it in hosts. \u2018Hi! who invited you?\u2019 said the\nlittle tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however,\nwho understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back\nagain in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all\npatience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,\nand saying: \u2018Wait, and I will give it to you,\u2019 struck it mercilessly on\nthem. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer\nthan seven, dead and with legs stretched out. \u2018Are you a fellow of that\nsort?\u2019 said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. \u2018The whole\ntown shall know of this!\u2019 And the little tailor hastened to cut himself\na girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: \u2018Seven at\none stroke!\u2019 \u2018What, the town!\u2019 he continued, \u2018the whole world shall hear\nof it!\u2019 and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb\u2019s tail. The tailor\nput on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he\nthought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away,\nhe sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could\ntake with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that\nhe put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which\nhad caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the\ncheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,\nhe felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had\nreached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking\npeacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,\nand said: \u2018Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the\nwide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.\nHave you any inclination to go with me?\u2019 The giant looked contemptuously\nat the tailor, and said: \u2018You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, indeed?\u2019 answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\nshowed the giant the girdle, \u2018there may you read what kind of a man I\nam!\u2019 The giant read: \u2018Seven at one stroke,\u2019 and thought that they had\nbeen men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect\nfor the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took\na stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\nof it. \u2018Do that likewise,\u2019 said the giant, \u2018if you have strength.\u2019 \u2018Is\nthat all?\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018that is child\u2019s play with us!\u2019 and put his\nhand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until\nthe liquid ran out of it. \u2018Faith,\u2019 said he, \u2018that was a little better,\nwasn\u2019t it?\u2019 The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it\nof the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high\nthat the eye could scarcely follow it. \u2018Now, little mite of a man, do\nthat likewise,\u2019 \u2018Well thrown,\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018but after all the stone\ncame down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come\nback at all,\u2019 and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,\nand threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty,\nrose, flew away and did not come back. \u2018How does that shot please you,\ncomrade?\u2019 asked the tailor. \u2018You can certainly throw,\u2019 said the giant,\n\u2018but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.\u2019 He\ntook the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on\nthe ground, and said: \u2018If you are strong enough, help me to carry the\ntree out of the forest.\u2019 \u2018Readily,\u2019 answered the little man; \u2018take you\nthe trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;\nafter all, they are the heaviest.\u2019 The giant took the trunk on his\nshoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who\ncould not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little\ntailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and\nwhistled the song: \u2018Three tailors rode forth from the gate,\u2019 as if\ncarrying the tree were child\u2019s play. The giant, after he had dragged the\nheavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: \u2018Hark\nyou, I shall have to let the tree fall!\u2019 The tailor sprang nimbly down,\nseized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said\nto the giant: \u2018You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\nthe tree!\u2019\n\nThey went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid\nhold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it\ndown, gave it into the tailor\u2019s hand, and bade him eat. But the little\ntailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,\nit sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.\nWhen he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: \u2018What is\nthis? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?\u2019 \u2018There is no\nlack of strength,\u2019 answered the little tailor. \u2018Do you think that could\nbe anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over\nthe tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.\nJump as I did, if you can do it.\u2019 The giant made the attempt but he\ncould not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so\nthat in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.\n\nThe giant said: \u2018If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our\ncavern and spend the night with us.\u2019 The little tailor was willing, and\nfollowed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting\nthere by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and\nwas eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: \u2018It is much\nmore spacious here than in my workshop.\u2019 The giant showed him a bed, and\nsaid he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too\nbig for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into\na corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little\ntailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,\ncut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the\ngrasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the\nforest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he\nwalked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified,\nthey were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a\ngreat hurry.\n\nThe little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.\nAfter he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal\npalace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.\nWhilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and\nread on his girdle: \u2018Seven at one stroke.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said they, \u2018what does\nthe great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty\nlord.\u2019 They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their\nopinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful\nman who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased\nthe king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer\nhim military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by\nthe sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,\nand then conveyed to him this proposal. \u2018For this very reason have\nI come here,\u2019 the tailor replied, \u2018I am ready to enter the king\u2019s\nservice.\u2019 He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling\nwas assigned him.\n\nThe soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished\nhim a thousand miles away. \u2018What is to be the end of this?\u2019 they said\namong themselves. \u2018If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,\nseven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against\nhim.\u2019 They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to\nthe king, and begged for their dismissal. \u2018We are not prepared,\u2019 said\nthey, \u2018to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.\u2019 The king was\nsorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,\nwished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly\nhave been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his\ndismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people\ndead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a\nlong time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor\nand caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one\nrequest to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants,\nwho caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging,\nand burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in\ndanger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he\nwould give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a\ndowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.\n\u2018That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!\u2019 thought the\nlittle tailor. \u2018One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a\nkingdom every day of one\u2019s life!\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 he replied, \u2018I will soon\nsubdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen\nto do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of\ntwo.\u2019\n\nThe little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.\nWhen he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:\n\u2018Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.\u2019 Then\nhe bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a\nwhile he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and\nsnored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not\nidle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the\ntree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat\njust above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on\nthe breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing,\nbut at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: \u2018Why are you\nknocking me?\u2019 \u2018You must be dreaming,\u2019 said the other, \u2018I am not knocking\nyou.\u2019 They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor\nthrew a stone down on the second. \u2018What is the meaning of this?\u2019 cried\nthe other \u2018Why are you pelting me?\u2019 \u2018I am not pelting you,\u2019 answered\nthe first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were\nweary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The\nlittle tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and\nthrew it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. \u2018That\nis too bad!\u2019 cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his\ncompanion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in\nthe same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and\nbelaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on\nthe ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. \u2018It is\na lucky thing,\u2019 said he, \u2018that they did not tear up the tree on which\nI was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a\nsquirrel; but we tailors are nimble.\u2019 He drew out his sword and gave\neach of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the\nhorsemen and said: \u2018The work is done; I have finished both of them\noff, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and\ndefended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man\nlike myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.\u2019 \u2018But are you not\nwounded?\u2019 asked the horsemen. \u2018You need not concern yourself about\nthat,\u2019 answered the tailor, \u2018they have not bent one hair of mine.\u2019 The\nhorsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they\nfound the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the\ntorn-up trees.\n\nThe little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,\nrepented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get\nrid of the hero. \u2018Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my\nkingdom,\u2019 said he to him, \u2018you must perform one more heroic deed. In\nthe forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch\nit first.\u2019 \u2018I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one\nblow, is my kind of affair.\u2019 He took a rope and an axe with him, went\nforth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to\nwait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards\nhim, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its\nhorn without more ado. \u2018Softly, softly; it can\u2019t be done as quickly as\nthat,\u2019 said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite\nclose, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against\nthe tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk\nthat it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it\nwas caught. \u2018Now, I have got the bird,\u2019 said the tailor, and came out\nfrom behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his\naxe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the\nbeast away and took it to the king.\n\nThe king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third\ndemand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\nmade great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their\nhelp. \u2018Willingly,\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018that is child\u2019s play!\u2019 He did not\ntake the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased\nthat he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in\nsuch a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When\nthe boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and\nwhetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero\nfled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at\nonce, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor\nran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging\nbeast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,\nwas caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they\nmight see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to\nthe king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his\npromise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known\nthat it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before\nhim, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding\nwas held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a\nking was made.\n\nAfter some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at\nnight: \u2018Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I\nwill rap the yard-measure over your ears.\u2019 Then she discovered in what\nstate of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained\nof her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of\nher husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her\nand said: \u2018Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants\nshall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind\nhim, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide\nworld.\u2019 The woman was satisfied with this; but the king\u2019s armour-bearer,\nwho had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of\nthe whole plot. \u2018I\u2019ll put a screw into that business,\u2019 said the little\ntailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and\nwhen she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door,\nand then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to\nbe asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: \u2018Boy, make me the doublet\nand patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your\nears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one\nunicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing\noutside the room.\u2019 When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they\nwere overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were\nbehind them, and none of them would venture anything further against\nhim. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his\nlife.", "Hansel and Gretel": "Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his\ntwo children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had\nlittle to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the\nland, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought\nover this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he\ngroaned and said to his wife: \u2018What is to become of us? How are we\nto feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for\nourselves?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you what, husband,\u2019 answered the woman, \u2018early\ntomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where\nit is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each\nof them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and\nleave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be\nrid of them.\u2019 \u2018No, wife,\u2019 said the man, \u2018I will not do that; how can I\nbear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would\nsoon come and tear them to pieces.\u2019 \u2018O, you fool!\u2019 said she, \u2018then we\nmust all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our\ncoffins,\u2019 and she left him no peace until he consented. \u2018But I feel very\nsorry for the poor children, all the same,\u2019 said the man.\n\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\nheard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept\nbitter tears, and said to Hansel: \u2018Now all is over with us.\u2019 \u2018Be quiet,\nGretel,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way\nto help us.\u2019 And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put\non his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon\nshone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house\nglittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the\nlittle pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went\nback and said to Gretel: \u2018Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in\npeace, God will not forsake us,\u2019 and he lay down again in his bed. When\nday dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the\ntwo children, saying: \u2018Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the\nforest to fetch wood.\u2019 She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:\n\u2018There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,\nfor you will get nothing else.\u2019 Gretel took the bread under her apron,\nas Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together\non the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel\nstood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.\nHis father said: \u2018Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying\nbehind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\nfather,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018I am looking at my little white cat, which is\nsitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.\u2019 The wife said:\n\u2018Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\nshining on the chimneys.\u2019 Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\nthe cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones\nout of his pocket on the road.\n\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: \u2018Now,\nchildren, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not\nbe cold.\u2019 Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a\nlittle hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning\nvery high, the woman said: \u2018Now, children, lay yourselves down by the\nfire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we\nhave done, we will come back and fetch you away.\u2019\n\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little\npiece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they\nbelieved that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but\na branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was\nblowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long\ntime, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When\nat last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and\nsaid: \u2018How are we to get out of the forest now?\u2019 But Hansel comforted\nher and said: \u2018Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we\nwill soon find the way.\u2019 And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took\nhis little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like\nnewly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\n\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more\nto their father\u2019s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman\nopened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: \u2018You naughty\nchildren, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were\nnever coming back at all!\u2019 The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut\nhim to the heart to leave them behind alone.\n\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the\nland, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their\nfather: \u2018Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that\nis the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the\nwood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other\nmeans of saving ourselves!\u2019 The man\u2019s heart was heavy, and he thought:\n\u2018It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your\nchildren.\u2019 The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to\nsay, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,\nand as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time\nalso.\n\nThe children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.\nWhen the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go\nout and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked\nthe door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his\nlittle sister, and said: \u2018Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the\ngood God will help us.\u2019\n\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their\nbeds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller\nthan the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his\nin his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.\n\u2018Hansel, why do you stop and look round?\u2019 said the father, \u2018go on.\u2019 \u2018I\nam looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and\nwants to say goodbye to me,\u2019 answered Hansel. \u2018Fool!\u2019 said the woman,\n\u2018that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining\non the chimney.\u2019 Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs\non the path.\n\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\nnever in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\nthe mother said: \u2018Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired\nyou may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in\nthe evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\u2019 When\nit was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had\nscattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but\nno one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark\nnight, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: \u2018Just wait,\nGretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread\nwhich I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\u2019 When\nthe moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many\nthousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked\nthem all up. Hansel said to Gretel: \u2018We shall soon find the way,\u2019 but\nthey did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day\ntoo from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\nand were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\nberries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their\nlegs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell\nasleep.\n\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father\u2019s house. They\nbegan to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\nhelp did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it\nwas mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,\nwhich sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And\nwhen its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,\nand they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of\nwhich it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw\nthat it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows\nwere of clear sugar. \u2018We will set to work on that,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018and\nhave a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat\nsome of the window, it will taste sweet.\u2019 Hansel reached up above, and\nbroke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant\nagainst the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried\nfrom the parlour:\n\n \u2018Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\n  Who is nibbling at my little house?\u2019\n\nThe children answered:\n\n \u2018The wind, the wind,\n  The heaven-born wind,\u2019\n\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the\ntaste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\nthe whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with\nit. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who\nsupported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were\nso terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their\nhands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: \u2018Oh, you dear\nchildren, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No\nharm shall happen to you.\u2019 She took them both by the hand, and led them\ninto her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and\npancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little\nbeds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down\nin them, and thought they were in heaven.\n\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality\na wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\nlittle house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell\ninto her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast\nday with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have\na keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.\nWhen Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with\nmalice, and said mockingly: \u2018I have them, they shall not escape me\nagain!\u2019 Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was\nalready up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so\npretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: \u2018That\nwill be a dainty mouthful!\u2019 Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled\nhand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a\ngrated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to\nGretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: \u2018Get up, lazy thing, fetch\nsome water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the\nstable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.\u2019\nGretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was\nforced to do what the wicked witch commanded.\n\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing\nbut crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and\ncried: \u2018Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon\nbe fat.\u2019 Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and\nthe old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was\nHansel\u2019s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening\nhim. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she\nwas seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. \u2018Now, then,\nGretel,\u2019 she cried to the girl, \u2018stir yourself, and bring some water.\nLet Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.\u2019 Ah,\nhow the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,\nand how her tears did flow down her cheeks! \u2018Dear God, do help us,\u2019 she\ncried. \u2018If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should\nat any rate have died together.\u2019 \u2018Just keep your noise to yourself,\u2019\nsaid the old woman, \u2018it won\u2019t help you at all.\u2019\n\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with\nthe water, and light the fire. \u2018We will bake first,\u2019 said the old woman,\n\u2018I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\u2019 She pushed poor\nGretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.\n\u2018Creep in,\u2019 said the witch, \u2018and see if it is properly heated, so that\nwe can put the bread in.\u2019 And once Gretel was inside, she intended to\nshut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.\nBut Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: \u2018I do not know how I am\nto do it; how do I get in?\u2019 \u2018Silly goose,\u2019 said the old woman. \u2018The door\nis big enough; just look, I can get in myself!\u2019 and she crept up and\nthrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove\nher far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then\nshe began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless\nwitch was miserably burnt to death.\n\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,\nand cried: \u2018Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!\u2019 Then Hansel\nsprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did\nrejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And\nas they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch\u2019s\nhouse, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.\n\u2018These are far better than pebbles!\u2019 said Hansel, and thrust into his\npockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: \u2018I, too, will take\nsomething home with me,\u2019 and filled her pinafore full. \u2018But now we must\nbe off,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018that we may get out of the witch\u2019s forest.\u2019\n\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of\nwater. \u2018We cannot cross,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018I see no foot-plank, and no\nbridge.\u2019 \u2018And there is also no ferry,\u2019 answered Gretel, \u2018but a white\nduck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.\u2019 Then she\ncried:\n\n \u2018Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\n  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\n  There\u2019s never a plank, or bridge in sight,\n  Take us across on thy back so white.\u2019\n\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told\nhis sister to sit by him. \u2018No,\u2019 replied Gretel, \u2018that will be too heavy\nfor the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.\u2019 The\ngood little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had\nwalked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar\nto them, and at length they saw from afar their father\u2019s house. Then\nthey began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round\ntheir father\u2019s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had\nleft the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel\nemptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the\nroom, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to\nadd to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together\nin perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever\ncatches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.", "The Mouse, the Bird, and the Sausage": "Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\npartnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;\nthey lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\nconsiderably to their stores. The bird\u2019s duty was to fly daily into the\nwood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw\nto the cooking.\n\nWhen people are too well off they always begin to long for something\nnew. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\nfellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\nhousehold arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a\npoor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\nat home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire\nand fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest\nuntil it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the\npot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near\ndinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out\namong the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,\nand salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and\nhad laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had\nfinished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following\nmorning: and that was really a very delightful life.\n\nInfluenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\nthe wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,\nand had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a\nchange, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray\nas the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\nmaster of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore\ndrew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse\nto cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.\n\nAnd now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\nmade the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\ntill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\nsausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\nflew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across\na dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate\nbooty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog\nof this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for\nthe dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and\nthat was the reason his life had been forfeited.\n\nHe picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he\nhad seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the\nbest of things and to remain with one another.\n\nSo now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,\nwishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and\nout among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the\npot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having\nalready parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.\n\nPresently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he\ncould nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood\nhere and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to\nbe found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,\ncaught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,\nbut his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable\nto recover himself, he was drowned.", "Mother Holle": "Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them\nwas beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,\nhowever, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own\ndaughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made\nto do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the\nfamily. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in\nthe high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it\nchanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl\nstopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out\nof her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her\nmisfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving\nher a violent scolding, said unkindly, \u2018As you have let the spindle fall\ninto the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.\u2019\n\nThe girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in\nher distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.\n\nShe remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\nbeautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming\nin every direction.\n\nShe walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker\u2019s oven\nfull of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, \u2018Take us out, take us\nout, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long\nago.\u2019 So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.\n\nShe went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.\n\u2018Shake me, shake me, I pray,\u2019 cried the tree; \u2018my apples, one and all,\nare ripe.\u2019 So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon\nher like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single\napple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a\nheap and walked on again.\n\nThe next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old\nwoman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and\nturned to run away. But the old woman called after her, \u2018What are you\nafraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house\nproperly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,\nhowever, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake\nit thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there\nin the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.\u2019 The old woman\nspoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter\ninto her service.\n\nShe took care to do everything according to the old woman\u2019s bidding and\nevery time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the\nfeathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good\nas her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and\nboiled meats every day.\n\nSo she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began\nto grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she\nbecame conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she\nwas homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother\nHolle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went\nto Mother Holle and said, \u2018I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with\nyou any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own\npeople.\u2019\n\nThen Mother Holle said, \u2018I am pleased that you should want to go back\nto your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I\nwill take you home myself.\u2019\n\nThereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate\nwas opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon\nher, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from\nhead to foot.\n\n\u2018That is a reward for your industry,\u2019 said Mother Holle, and as she\nspoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.\n\nThe gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\nworld close to her mother\u2019s house. As she entered the courtyard, the\ncock who was perched on the well, called out:\n\n \u2018Cock-a-doodle-doo!\n  Your golden daughter\u2019s come back to you.\u2019\n\nThen she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\ncovered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them\nall that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her\ngreat riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go\nand try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well\nand spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a\nthorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then\nshe threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.\n\nLike her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it\ntill she came to the oven. \u2018Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall\nbe burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,\u2019 cried the loaves\nas before. But the lazy girl answered, \u2018Do you think I am going to dirty\nmy hands for you?\u2019 and walked on.\n\nPresently she came to the apple-tree. \u2018Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\napples, one and all, are ripe,\u2019 it cried. But she only answered, \u2018A nice\nthing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,\u2019 and\npassed on.\n\nAt last she came to Mother Holle\u2019s house, and as she had heard all about\nthe large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\nherself without delay to the old woman.\n\nThe first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\nto please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\nreturn. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and\nthe third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in\nthe mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to\nmake the old woman\u2019s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the\nfeathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,\nand told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and\nthought to herself, \u2018The gold will soon be mine.\u2019 Mother Holle led her,\nas she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing\nthrough, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came\npouring over her.\n\n\u2018That is in return for your services,\u2019 said the old woman, and she shut\nthe gate.\n\nSo the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the\nwell called out as she saw her:\n\n \u2018Cock-a-doodle-doo!\n  Your dirty daughter\u2019s come back to you.\u2019\n\nBut, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to\nher as long as she lived.", "Little Red-Cap ": "[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]\n\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone\nwho looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was\nnothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a\nlittle cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never\nwear anything else; so she was always called \u2018Little Red-Cap.\u2019\n\nOne day her mother said to her: \u2018Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\nof cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill\nand weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and\nwhen you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,\nor you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\nget nothing; and when you go into her room, don\u2019t forget to say, \u201cGood\nmorning\u201d, and don\u2019t peep into every corner before you do it.\u2019\n\n\u2018I will take great care,\u2019 said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave\nher hand on it.\n\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,\nand just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap\ndid not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of\nhim.\n\n\u2018Good day, Little Red-Cap,\u2019 said he.\n\n\u2018Thank you kindly, wolf.\u2019\n\n\u2018Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?\u2019\n\n\u2018To my grandmother\u2019s.\u2019\n\n\u2018What have you got in your apron?\u2019\n\n\u2018Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to\nhave something good, to make her stronger.\u2019\n\n\u2018Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?\u2019\n\n\u2018A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands\nunder the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you\nsurely must know it,\u2019 replied Little Red-Cap.\n\nThe wolf thought to himself: \u2018What a tender young creature! what a nice\nplump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must\nact craftily, so as to catch both.\u2019 So he walked for a short time by\nthe side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: \u2018See, Little Red-Cap, how\npretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,\ntoo, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you\nwalk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else\nout here in the wood is merry.\u2019\n\nLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\nhere and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,\nshe thought: \u2018Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would\nplease her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there\nin good time\u2019; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for\nflowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a\nstill prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and\ndeeper into the wood.\n\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother\u2019s house and knocked\nat the door.\n\n\u2018Who is there?\u2019\n\n\u2018Little Red-Cap,\u2019 replied the wolf. \u2018She is bringing cake and wine; open\nthe door.\u2019\n\n\u2018Lift the latch,\u2019 called out the grandmother, \u2018I am too weak, and cannot\nget up.\u2019\n\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a\nword he went straight to the grandmother\u2019s bed, and devoured her. Then\nhe put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\nand drew the curtains.\n\nLittle Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\nand when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she\nremembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\n\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\nwent into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\nherself: \u2018Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like\nbeing with grandmother so much.\u2019 She called out: \u2018Good morning,\u2019 but\nreceived no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.\nThere lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and\nlooking very strange.\n\n\u2018Oh! grandmother,\u2019 she said, \u2018what big ears you have!\u2019\n\n\u2018The better to hear you with, my child,\u2019 was the reply.\n\n\u2018But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018The better to see you with, my dear.\u2019\n\n\u2018But, grandmother, what large hands you have!\u2019\n\n\u2018The better to hug you with.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!\u2019\n\n\u2018The better to eat you with!\u2019\n\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of\nbed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\n\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\nfell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing\nthe house, and thought to himself: \u2018How the old woman is snoring! I must\njust see if she wants anything.\u2019 So he went into the room, and when he\ncame to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. \u2018Do I find you\nhere, you old sinner!\u2019 said he. \u2018I have long sought you!\u2019 Then just as\nhe was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\ndevoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did\nnot fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach\nof the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little\nRed-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl\nsprang out, crying: \u2018Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was\ninside the wolf\u2019; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive\nalso, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched\ngreat stones with which they filled the wolf\u2019s belly, and when he awoke,\nhe wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at\nonce, and fell dead.\n\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf\u2019s skin and\nwent home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which\nRed-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: \u2018As\nlong as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the\nwood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\u2019\n\nIt also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old\ngrandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the\npath. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on\nher way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he\nhad said \u2018good morning\u2019 to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,\nthat if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would\nhave eaten her up. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the grandmother, \u2018we will shut the door,\nthat he may not come in.\u2019 Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:\n\u2018Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you\nsome cakes.\u2019 But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard\nstole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,\nintending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to\nsteal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother\nsaw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone\ntrough, so she said to the child: \u2018Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some\nsausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the\ntrough.\u2019 Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the\nsmell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down,\nand at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep\nhis footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight\ninto the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home,\nand no one ever did anything to harm her again.", "The Robber Bridegroom": "There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was\ngrown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided\nfor. He said to himself, \u2018I will give her to the first suitable man who\ncomes and asks for her hand.\u2019 Not long after a suitor appeared, and as\nhe appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with\nwhich to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did\nnot care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.\nShe did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him\nnor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, \u2018You\nhave not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some\ntime.\u2019 \u2018I do not know where your house is,\u2019 she answered. \u2018My house is\nout there in the dark forest,\u2019 he said. She tried to excuse herself by\nsaying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed\nonly replied, \u2018You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already\ninvited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I\nwill strew ashes along the path.\u2019\n\nWhen Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\ndread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might\nbe able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and\nlentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the\nentrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these\nshe followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every\nstep she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,\ndarkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so\ngrim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped\ninside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned\nthroughout. Suddenly a voice cried:\n\n \u2018Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\n  Linger not in this murderers\u2019 lair.\u2019\n\nThe girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a\ncage on the wall. Again it cried:\n\n \u2018Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\n  Linger not in this murderers\u2019 lair.\u2019\n\nThe girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were\nall empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,\nand there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from\nshaking. \u2018Can you tell me,\u2019 asked the girl, \u2018if my betrothed husband\nlives here?\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, you poor child,\u2019 answered the old woman, \u2018what a place for you to\ncome to! This is a murderers\u2019 den. You think yourself a promised bride,\nand that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that\nyou will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron\nof water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have\nyou in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat\nyou, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save\nyou, you would be lost.\u2019\n\nThereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her\nfrom view. \u2018Keep as still as a mouse,\u2019 she said; \u2018do not move or speak,\nor it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are\nall asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an\nopportunity to escape.\u2019\n\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,\ndragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and\npaid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,\nthree glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,\nand with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her\ndainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into\npieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.\n\nThe poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the\ncask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by\nthe robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on\nthe little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off\neasily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang\ninto the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was\nhiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he\ncould not find it. \u2018Have you looked behind the large cask?\u2019 said one of\nthe others. But the old woman called out, \u2018Come and eat your suppers,\nand let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won\u2019t run away.\u2019\n\n\u2018The old woman is right,\u2019 said the robbers, and they ceased looking for\nthe finger and sat down.\n\nThe old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before\nlong they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and\nsnoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind\nthe cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who\nwere lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed\ndread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she\npassed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,\nopened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers\u2019\nden. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and\nlentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide\nthem in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it\nwas morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father\nall that had happened.\n\nThe day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom\narrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken\ncare to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,\neach guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did\nnot say a word.\n\n\u2018And you, my love,\u2019 said the bridegroom, turning to her, \u2018is there no\ntale you know? Tell us something.\u2019\n\n\u2018I will tell you a dream, then,\u2019 said the bride. \u2018I went alone through a\nforest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but\na bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:\n\n \u2018Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\n  Linger not in this murderers\u2019 lair.\u2019\n\nand again a second time it said these words.\u2019\n\n\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\n\n\u2018I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,\nand everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the\ncellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her\nhead still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,\n\u201cAh, you poor child, you are come to a murderers\u2019 den; your betrothed\ndoes indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards\ncook and eat you.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\n\n\u2018The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done\nthis when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with\nthem. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and\nyellow, and with that she died.\u2019\n\n\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\n\n\u2018Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into\npieces and sprinkled salt upon it.\u2019\n\n\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\n\n\u2018And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her\nfinger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut\noff her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the\ngreat cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.\u2019 And\nwith these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the\nassembled guests.\n\nThe bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and\ntried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They\ndelivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were\ncondemned to death for their wicked deeds.", "Tom Thumb": "A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the\nfireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. \u2018How lonely it is,\nwife,\u2019 said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, \u2018for you and me\nto sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse\nus while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!\u2019\n\u2018What you say is very true,\u2019 said the wife, sighing, and turning round\nher wheel; \u2018how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were\never so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very\nhappy, and love it dearly.\u2019 Now--odd as you may think it--it came to\npass that this good woman\u2019s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she\nhad wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was\nquite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So\nthey said, \u2018Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,\nlittle as he is, we will love him dearly.\u2019 And they called him Thomas\nThumb.\n\nThey gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\nbigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.\nStill, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to\nbe a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.\n\nOne day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut\nfuel, he said, \u2018I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I\nwant to make haste.\u2019 \u2018Oh, father,\u2019 cried Tom, \u2018I will take care of that;\nthe cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.\u2019 Then the woodman\nlaughed, and said, \u2018How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse\u2019s\nbridle.\u2019 \u2018Never mind that, father,\u2019 said Tom; \u2018if my mother will only\nharness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to\ngo.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said the father, \u2018we will try for once.\u2019\n\nWhen the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put\nTom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how\nto go, crying out, \u2018Go on!\u2019 and \u2018Stop!\u2019 as he wanted: and thus the horse\nwent on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the\nwood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom\nwas calling out, \u2018Gently! gently!\u2019 two strangers came up. \u2018What an odd\nthing that is!\u2019 said one: \u2018there is a cart going along, and I hear a\ncarter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.\u2019 \u2018That is queer,\nindeed,\u2019 said the other; \u2018let us follow the cart, and see where it\ngoes.\u2019 So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the\nplace where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried\nout, \u2018See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take\nme down!\u2019 So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with\nthe other took his son out of the horse\u2019s ear, and put him down upon a\nstraw, where he sat as merry as you please.\n\nThe two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what\nto say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, \u2018That\nlittle urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him\nabout from town to town as a show; we must buy him.\u2019 So they went up to\nthe woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. \u2018He\nwill be better off,\u2019 said they, \u2018with us than with you.\u2019 \u2018I won\u2019t sell\nhim at all,\u2019 said the father; \u2018my own flesh and blood is dearer to me\nthan all the silver and gold in the world.\u2019 But Tom, hearing of the\nbargain they wanted to make, crept up his father\u2019s coat to his shoulder\nand whispered in his ear, \u2018Take the money, father, and let them have me;\nI\u2019ll soon come back to you.\u2019\n\nSo the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a\nlarge piece of gold, and they paid the price. \u2018Where would you like to\nsit?\u2019 said one of them. \u2018Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be\na nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we\ngo along.\u2019 So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his\nfather they took him away with them.\n\nThey journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man\nsaid, \u2018Let me get down, I\u2019m tired.\u2019 So the man took off his hat, and\nput him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the\nroad. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into\nan old mouse-hole. \u2018Good night, my masters!\u2019 said he, \u2018I\u2019m off! mind and\nlook sharp after me the next time.\u2019 Then they ran at once to the place,\nand poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;\nTom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite\ndark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as\nsulky as could be.\n\nWhen Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. \u2018What\ndangerous walking it is,\u2019 said he, \u2018in this ploughed field! If I were to\nfall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.\u2019\nAt last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. \u2018This is\nlucky,\u2019 said he, \u2018I can sleep here very well\u2019; and in he crept.\n\nJust as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting\ntogether; and one said to the other, \u2018How can we rob that rich parson\u2019s\nhouse of his silver and gold?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you!\u2019 cried Tom. \u2018What noise\nwas that?\u2019 said the thief, frightened; \u2018I\u2019m sure I heard someone speak.\u2019\nThey stood still listening, and Tom said, \u2018Take me with you, and I\u2019ll\nsoon show you how to get the parson\u2019s money.\u2019 \u2018But where are you?\u2019 said\nthey. \u2018Look about on the ground,\u2019 answered he, \u2018and listen where the\nsound comes from.\u2019 At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him\nup in their hands. \u2018You little urchin!\u2019 they said, \u2018what can you do for\nus?\u2019 \u2018Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson\u2019s house,\nand throw you out whatever you want.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a good thought,\u2019 said the\nthieves; \u2018come along, we shall see what you can do.\u2019\n\nWhen they came to the parson\u2019s house, Tom slipped through the\nwindow-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,\n\u2018Will you have all that is here?\u2019 At this the thieves were frightened,\nand said, \u2018Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.\u2019\nBut Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,\n\u2018How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?\u2019 Now the cook lay in\nthe next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and\nlistened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little\nway; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, \u2018The little\nurchin is only trying to make fools of us.\u2019 So they came back and\nwhispered softly to him, saying, \u2018Now let us have no more of your\nroguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.\u2019 Then Tom called out\nas loud as he could, \u2018Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.\u2019\n\nThe cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to\nopen the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and\nthe maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.\nBy the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when\nshe had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found\nnobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her\neyes open.\n\nThe little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug\nplace to finish his night\u2019s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning\nto sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and\nmother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows\nhappen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,\nto feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away\na large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast\nasleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found\nhimself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the\ncow\u2019s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. \u2018Good\nlack-a-day!\u2019 said he, \u2018how came I to tumble into the mill?\u2019 But he soon\nfound out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about\nhim, that he might not get between the cow\u2019s teeth, and so be crushed to\ndeath. At last down he went into her stomach. \u2018It is rather dark,\u2019 said\nhe; \u2018they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a\ncandle would be no bad thing.\u2019\n\nThough he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at\nall; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming\ndown, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he\ncried out as loud as he could, \u2018Don\u2019t bring me any more hay! Don\u2019t bring\nme any more hay!\u2019\n\nThe maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone\nspeak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice\nthat she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off\nher stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself\nup out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the\nparson, and said, \u2018Sir, sir, the cow is talking!\u2019 But the parson\nsaid, \u2018Woman, thou art surely mad!\u2019 However, he went with her into the\ncow-house, to try and see what was the matter.\n\nScarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, \u2018Don\u2019t\nbring me any more hay!\u2019 Then the parson himself was frightened; and\nthinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the\nspot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom\nlay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.\n\nTom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy\ntask; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh\nill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the\nwhole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.\n\nTom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would\nnot dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called\nout, \u2018My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.\u2019 \u2018Where\u2019s that?\u2019\nsaid the wolf. \u2018In such and such a house,\u2019 said Tom, describing his own\nfather\u2019s house. \u2018You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and\nthen into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold\nchicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can\nwish.\u2019\n\nThe wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to\nthe house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into\nthe pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart\u2019s content. As soon as\nhe had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that\nhe could not go out by the same way he came in.\n\nThis was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a\ngreat shout, making all the noise he could. \u2018Will you be easy?\u2019 said the\nwolf; \u2018you\u2019ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s that to me?\u2019 said the little man; \u2018you have had your frolic, now\nI\u2019ve a mind to be merry myself\u2019; and he began, singing and shouting as\nloud as he could.\n\nThe woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through\na crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well\nsuppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his\naxe, and gave his wife a scythe. \u2018Do you stay behind,\u2019 said the woodman,\n\u2018and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the\nscythe.\u2019 Tom heard all this, and cried out, \u2018Father, father! I am here,\nthe wolf has swallowed me.\u2019 And his father said, \u2018Heaven be praised! we\nhave found our dear child again\u2019; and he told his wife not to use the\nscythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and\nstruck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was\ndead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the father,\n\u2018what fears we have had for you!\u2019 \u2018Yes, father,\u2019 answered he; \u2018I have\ntravelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we\nparted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.\u2019\n\u2018Why, where have you been?\u2019 said his father. \u2018I have been in a\nmouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow\u2019s throat--and in the\nwolf\u2019s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said they, \u2018you are come back, and we will not sell you again\nfor all the riches in the world.\u2019\n\nThen they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty\nto eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new\nclothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.\nSo Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for\nthough he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many\nfine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always\nagreed that, after all, there\u2019s no place like HOME!", "Rumpelstiltskin": "By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream\nof water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller\u2019s house was\nclose by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.\nShe was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud\nof her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and\nhunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now\nthis king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller\u2019s boast\nhis greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before\nhim. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great\nheap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, \u2018All this must\nbe spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.\u2019 It was in vain\nthat the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,\nfor that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber\ndoor was locked, and she was left alone.\n\nShe sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard\nfate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man\nhobbled in, and said, \u2018Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you\nweeping for?\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 said she, \u2018I must spin this straw into gold, and\nI know not how.\u2019 \u2018What will you give me,\u2019 said the hobgoblin, \u2018to do it\nfor you?\u2019 \u2018My necklace,\u2019 replied the maiden. He took her at her word,\nand sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\n\n \u2018Round about, round about,\n    Lo and behold!\n  Reel away, reel away,\n    Straw into gold!\u2019\n\nAnd round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and\nthe straw was all spun into gold.\n\nWhen the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;\nbut his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor\nmiller\u2019s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,\nand sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and\nsaid, \u2018What will you give me to do your task?\u2019 \u2018The ring on my finger,\u2019\nsaid she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the\nwheel again, and whistled and sang:\n\n \u2018Round about, round about,\n    Lo and behold!\n  Reel away, reel away,\n    Straw into gold!\u2019\n\ntill, long before morning, all was done again.\n\nThe king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;\nbut still he had not enough: so he took the miller\u2019s daughter to a yet\nlarger heap, and said, \u2018All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,\nyou shall be my queen.\u2019 As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and\nsaid, \u2018What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?\u2019\n\u2018I have nothing left,\u2019 said she. \u2018Then say you will give me,\u2019 said\nthe little man, \u2018the first little child that you may have when you are\nqueen.\u2019 \u2018That may never be,\u2019 thought the miller\u2019s daughter: and as she\nknew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he\nasked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once\nmore spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding\nall he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller\u2019s\ndaughter, and she really became queen.\n\nAt the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the\ndwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where\nshe was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then\nshe grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all\nthe wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at\nlast her tears softened him, and he said, \u2018I will give you three days\u2019\ngrace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your\nchild.\u2019\n\nNow the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that\nshe had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find\nout new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with\nTIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could\nremember; but to all and each of them he said, \u2018Madam, that is not my\nname.\u2019\n\nThe second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,\nBANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman\nstill said to every one of them, \u2018Madam, that is not my name.\u2019\n\nThe third day one of the messengers came back, and said, \u2018I have\ntravelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as\nI was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox\nand the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before\nthe hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was\ndancing upon one leg, and singing:\n\n \u201cMerrily the feast I\u2019ll make.\n  Today I\u2019ll brew, tomorrow bake;\n  Merrily I\u2019ll dance and sing,\n  For next day will a stranger bring.\n  Little does my lady dream\n  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!\u201d\n\nWhen the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little\nfriend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round\nto enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her\narms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began\nto chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with\nhim to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, \u2018Now, lady, what is my\nname?\u2019 \u2018Is it JOHN?\u2019 asked she. \u2018No, madam!\u2019 \u2018Is it TOM?\u2019 \u2018No, madam!\u2019\n\u2018Is it JEMMY?\u2019 \u2018It is not.\u2019 \u2018Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?\u2019 said the\nlady slyly. \u2018Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!\u2019 cried\nthe little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the\nfloor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it\nout.\n\nThen he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the\nbaby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much\ntrouble for nothing, and said, \u2018We wish you a very good morning, and a\nmerry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!\u2019", "Clever Gretel": "There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and\nwhen she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,\nwas quite happy and thought: \u2018You certainly are a pretty girl!\u2019 And when\nshe came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,\nand as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she\nwas cooking until she was satisfied, and said: \u2018The cook must know what\nthe food is like.\u2019\n\nIt came to pass that the master one day said to her: \u2018Gretel, there is a\nguest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.\u2019 \u2018I will\nsee to it, master,\u2019 answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,\nplucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before\nthe fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were\nnearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out\nto her master: \u2018If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away\nfrom the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten\nthe moment they are at their juiciest.\u2019 The master said: \u2018I will run\nmyself, and fetch the guest.\u2019 When the master had turned his back,\nGretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: \u2018Standing\nso long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows\nwhen they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a\ndrink.\u2019 She ran down, set a jug, said: \u2018God bless it for you, Gretel,\u2019\nand took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should\nnot be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.\n\nThen she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,\nand drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,\nGretel thought: \u2018Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!\u2019\nShe touched it with her finger, and said: \u2018Ah! how good fowls are! It\ncertainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right\ntime!\u2019 She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with\nhis guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:\n\u2018One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.\u2019\nSo she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she\nthought: \u2018The other must go down too, or else master will observe that\nsomething is missing.\u2019 When the two wings were eaten, she went and\nlooked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to\nher: \u2018Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in\nsomewhere.\u2019 Then she said: \u2018Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has\nbeen cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is\neaten you will have some peace, why should God\u2019s good gifts be spoilt?\u2019\nSo she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the\none chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,\nand still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:\n\u2018What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what\u2019s\nright for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take\nanother draught it would do me no harm.\u2019 So she took another hearty\ndrink, and let the second chicken follow the first.\n\nWhile she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: \u2018Hurry\nup, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir, I will\nsoon serve up,\u2019 answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that\nthe table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was\ngoing to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently\nthe guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.\nGretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,\nshe put her finger to her lips and said: \u2018Hush! hush! go away as quickly\nas you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he\ncertainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your\ntwo ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!\u2019 The guest\nheard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he\ncould. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:\n\u2018You have invited a fine guest!\u2019 \u2018Why, Gretel? What do you mean by\nthat?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018he has taken the chickens which I was just\ngoing to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a\nnice trick!\u2019 said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. \u2018If he had\nbut left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.\u2019 He called to\nhim to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him\nwith the knife still in his hand, crying: \u2018Just one, just one,\u2019 meaning\nthat the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The\nguest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of\nhis ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take\nthem both with him.", "The Old Man and His Grandson": "There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull\nof hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly\nhold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run\nout of his mouth. His son and his son\u2019s wife were disgusted at this, so\nthe old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,\nand they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough\nof it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of\ntears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it\nfell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said\nnothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few\nhalf-pence, out of which he had to eat.\n\nThey were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old\nbegan to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. \u2018What are\nyou doing there?\u2019 asked the father. \u2018I am making a little trough,\u2019\nanswered the child, \u2018for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.\u2019\n\nThe man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently\nbegan to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and\nhenceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he\ndid spill a little of anything.", "The Little Peasant": "There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\npeasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He\nhad not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and\nyet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:\n\u2018Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall\nmake us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any\nother, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.\u2019 the woman\nalso liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed\nthe calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head\nhanging down as if it were eating.\n\nNext morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\ncalled the cow-herd in and said: \u2018Look, I have a little calf there,\nbut it is still small and has to be carried.\u2019 The cow-herd said: \u2018All\nright,\u2019 and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set\nit among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one\nwhich was eating, and the cow-herd said: \u2018It will soon run by itself,\njust look how it eats already!\u2019 At night when he was going to drive the\nherd home again, he said to the calf: \u2018If you can stand there and eat\nyour fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don\u2019t care to drag you\nhome again in my arms.\u2019 But the little peasant stood at his door, and\nwaited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through\nthe village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The\ncow-herd answered: \u2018It is still standing out there eating. It would not\nstop and come with us.\u2019 But the little peasant said: \u2018Oh, but I must\nhave my beast back again.\u2019 Then they went back to the meadow together,\nbut someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: \u2018It\nmust have run away.\u2019 The peasant, however, said: \u2018Don\u2019t tell me\nthat,\u2019 and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness\ncondemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.\n\nAnd now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had\nso long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for\nit, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They\nsalted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell\nthe skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On\nthe way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,\nand out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the\nweather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could\ngo no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The\nmiller\u2019s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: \u2018Lay\nyourself on the straw there,\u2019 and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.\nThe peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman\nthought: \u2018He is tired and has gone to sleep.\u2019 In the meantime came the\nparson; the miller\u2019s wife received him well, and said: \u2018My husband is\nout, so we will have a feast.\u2019 The peasant listened, and when he heard\nthem talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make\nshift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four\ndifferent things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\n\nJust as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking\noutside. The woman said: \u2018Oh, heavens! It is my husband!\u2019 she quickly\nhid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,\nthe salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet\non the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: \u2018Thank\nheaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the\nworld were coming to an end.\u2019 The miller saw the peasant lying on the\nstraw, and asked, \u2018What is that fellow doing there?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said the\nwife, \u2018the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for\nshelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where\nthe straw was.\u2019 The man said: \u2018I have no objection, but be quick and get\nme something to eat.\u2019 The woman said: \u2018But I have nothing but bread and\ncheese.\u2019 \u2018I am contented with anything,\u2019 replied the husband, \u2018so far as\nI am concerned, bread and cheese will do,\u2019 and looked at the peasant and\nsaid: \u2018Come and eat some more with me.\u2019 The peasant did not require to\nbe invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin\nin which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: \u2018What have you\nthere?\u2019 The peasant answered: \u2018I have a soothsayer inside it.\u2019 \u2018Can\nhe foretell anything to me?\u2019 said the miller. \u2018Why not?\u2019 answered\nthe peasant: \u2018but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to\nhimself.\u2019 The miller was curious, and said: \u2018Let him foretell something\nfor once.\u2019 Then the peasant pinched the raven\u2019s head, so that he croaked\nand made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: \u2018What did he say?\u2019 The\npeasant answered: \u2018In the first place, he says that there is some wine\nhidden under the pillow.\u2019 \u2018Bless me!\u2019 cried the miller, and went there\nand found the wine. \u2018Now go on,\u2019 said he. The peasant made the raven\ncroak again, and said: \u2018In the second place, he says that there is some\nroast meat in the tiled stove.\u2019 \u2018Upon my word!\u2019 cried the miller, and\nwent thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven\nprophesy still more, and said: \u2018Thirdly, he says that there is some\nsalad on the bed.\u2019 \u2018That would be a fine thing!\u2019 cried the miller, and\nwent there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven\nonce more till he croaked, and said: \u2018Fourthly, he says that there\nare some cakes under the bed.\u2019 \u2018That would be a fine thing!\u2019 cried the\nmiller, and looked there, and found the cakes.\n\nAnd now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller\u2019s wife\nwas frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with\nher. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little\npeasant said: \u2018First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth\nis something bad.\u2019 So they ate, and after that they bargained how much\nthe miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on\nthree hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven\u2019s\nhead till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: \u2018What did he say?\u2019 The\npeasant replied: \u2018He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in\nthe closet on the porch.\u2019 The miller said: \u2018The Devil must go out,\u2019 and\nopened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,\nand the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he\ncould, and the miller said: \u2018It was true; I saw the black rascal with my\nown eyes.\u2019 The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with\nthe three hundred talers.\n\nAt home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\nhouse, and the peasants said: \u2018The small peasant has certainly been to\nthe place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in\nshovels.\u2019 Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and\nbidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: \u2018I sold my cow\u2019s\nskin in the town, for three hundred talers.\u2019 When the peasants heard\nthat, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed\nall their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in\nthe town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: \u2018But my\nservant must go first.\u2019 When she came to the merchant in the town, he\ndid not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others\ncame, he did not give them so much, and said: \u2018What can I do with all\nthese skins?\u2019\n\nThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\noutwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this\ntreachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously\nsentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel\npierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who\nwas to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to\na distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the\nman who had been with the miller\u2019s wife. He said to him: \u2018I set you free\nfrom the closet, set me free from the barrel.\u2019 At this same moment up\ncame, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had\nlong been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: \u2018No, I\nwill not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!\u2019 The\nshepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: \u2018What are you about?\nWhat is it that you will not do?\u2019 The peasant said: \u2018They want to make\nme mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.\u2019\nThe shepherd said: \u2018If nothing more than that is needful in order to be\nmayor, I would get into the barrel at once.\u2019 The peasant said: \u2018If you\nwill get in, you will be mayor.\u2019 The shepherd was willing, and got in,\nand the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd\u2019s\nflock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,\nand declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the\nbarrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd\ncried: \u2018I am quite willing to be mayor.\u2019 They believed no otherwise than\nthat it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: \u2018That is\nwhat we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below\nthere,\u2019 and they rolled the barrel down into the water.\n\nAfter that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the\nvillage, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of\nsheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,\nand said: \u2018Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the\nwater?\u2019 \u2018Yes, truly,\u2019 replied the peasant, \u2018I sank deep, deep down,\nuntil at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the\nbarrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number\nof lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with\nme.\u2019 Said the peasants: \u2018Are there any more there?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he,\n\u2018more than I could want.\u2019 Then the peasants made up their minds that\nthey too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the\nmayor said: \u2018I come first.\u2019 So they went to the water together, and just\nthen there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which\nare called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon\nthe peasants cried: \u2018We already see the sheep down below!\u2019 The mayor\npressed forward and said: \u2018I will go down first, and look about me, and\nif things promise well I\u2019ll call you.\u2019 So he jumped in; splash! went\nthe water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd\nplunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and\nthe small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.", "Frederick and Catherine": "There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\nCatherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.\n\u2018Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\nhungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.\u2019\n\u2018Very well,\u2019 said she, \u2018it shall all be ready.\u2019 When dinner-time drew\nnigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and\nput it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to\ncrackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:\nthen she said to herself, \u2018The steak is almost ready, I may as well go\nto the cellar for the ale.\u2019 So she left the pan on the fire and took a\nlarge jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran\ninto the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her\nhead, \u2018The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;\nthat\u2019s well thought of.\u2019 So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough\nthe rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with\nit.\n\nAway ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\nfaster than she, and stuck close to the steak. \u2018It\u2019s all gone, and \u201cwhat\ncan\u2019t be cured must be endured\u201d,\u2019 said Catherine. So she turned round;\nand as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely\nto cool herself.\n\nNow all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\nthe cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till\nthe cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\nhappened. \u2018My stars!\u2019 said she, \u2018what shall I do to keep Frederick from\nseeing all this slopping about?\u2019 So she thought a while; and at last\nremembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,\nand that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale\nnicely. \u2018What a lucky thing,\u2019 said she, \u2018that we kept that meal! we have\nnow a good use for it.\u2019 So away she went for it: but she managed to set\nit down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus\nall the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. \u2018Ah!\nwell,\u2019 said she, \u2018when one goes another may as well follow.\u2019 Then she\nstrewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her\ncleverness, and said, \u2018How very neat and clean it looks!\u2019\n\nAt noon Frederick came home. \u2018Now, wife,\u2019 cried he, \u2018what have you for\ndinner?\u2019 \u2018O Frederick!\u2019 answered she, \u2018I was cooking you a steak; but\nwhile I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while\nI ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale\nwith the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the\ncellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!\u2019 \u2018Kate, Kate,\u2019 said he,\n\u2018how could you do all this?\u2019 Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the\nale to run, and then spoil all the meal?\u2019 \u2018Why, Frederick,\u2019 said she, \u2018I\ndid not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.\u2019\n\nThe husband thought to himself, \u2018If my wife manages matters thus, I must\nlook sharp myself.\u2019 Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he\nsaid to Catherine, \u2018What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put\nthem into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you\nnever go near or meddle with them.\u2019 \u2018No, Frederick,\u2019 said she, \u2018that\nI never will.\u2019 As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with\nearthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.\n\u2018Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if\nyou had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.\u2019 \u2018Yellow\nbuttons!\u2019 said they: \u2018let us have a look at them.\u2019 \u2018Go into the garden\nand dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare\nnot go myself.\u2019 So the rogues went: and when they found what these\nyellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of\nplates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:\nand when Frederick came back, he cried out, \u2018Kate, what have you been\ndoing?\u2019 \u2018See,\u2019 said she, \u2018I have bought all these with your yellow\nbuttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves\nand dug them up.\u2019 \u2018Wife, wife,\u2019 said Frederick, \u2018what a pretty piece of\nwork you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you\nto do such a thing?\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 answered she, \u2018I did not know there was any\nharm in it; you should have told me.\u2019\n\nCatherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,\n\u2018Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after\nthe thieves.\u2019 \u2018Well, we will try,\u2019 answered he; \u2018but take some butter\nand cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.\u2019\n\u2018Very well,\u2019 said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the\nfastest, he left his wife some way behind. \u2018It does not matter,\u2019 thought\nshe: \u2018when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.\u2019\n\nPresently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there\nwas a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees\non each side as they passed. \u2018Ah, see now,\u2019 said she, \u2018how they have\nbruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.\u2019 So she\ntook pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so\nthat the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this\nkind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down\nthe hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she\nsaid, \u2018Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he\nhas younger legs than I have.\u2019 Then she rolled the other cheese after\nit; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said\nshe supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she\ncould not stay there all day waiting for them.\n\nAt last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to\neat. Then she gave him the dry bread. \u2018Where are the butter and cheese?\u2019\nsaid he. \u2018Oh!\u2019 answered she, \u2018I used the butter to grease those poor\ntrees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I\nsent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on\nthe road together somewhere.\u2019 \u2018What a goose you are to do such silly\nthings!\u2019 said the husband. \u2018How can you say so?\u2019 said she; \u2018I am sure\nyou never told me not.\u2019\n\nThey ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, \u2018Kate, I hope you\nlocked the door safe when you came away.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered she, \u2018you did\nnot tell me.\u2019 \u2018Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,\u2019\nsaid Frederick, \u2018and bring with you something to eat.\u2019\n\nCatherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\n\u2018Frederick wants something to eat; but I don\u2019t think he is very fond of\nbutter and cheese: I\u2019ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,\nfor I have often seen him take some.\u2019\n\nWhen she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she\ntook off the hinges, and said, \u2018Frederick told me to lock the door, but\nsurely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.\u2019 So she took\nher time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried\nout, \u2018There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as\ncarefully as you please.\u2019 \u2018Alas! alas!\u2019 said he, \u2018what a clever wife I\nhave! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so\nthat everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have\nbrought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.\u2019\n\u2018Very well,\u2019 answered she, \u2018I\u2019ll carry the door; but I\u2019ll not carry the\nnuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if\nyou please, I\u2019ll fasten them to the door.\u2019\n\nFrederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off\ninto the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and\nwhen it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.\nScarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they\nwere looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that\nclass of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;\nso they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and\nCatherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up\nsome stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on\nthe head with them: but they only said, \u2018It must be near morning, for\nthe wind shakes the fir-apples down.\u2019\n\nCatherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;\nbut she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said\nsoftly, \u2018Frederick, I must let the nuts go.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered he, \u2018not\nnow, they will discover us.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t help that: they must go.\u2019 \u2018Well,\nthen, make haste and throw them down, if you will.\u2019 Then away rattled\nthe nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, \u2018Bless me,\nit is hailing.\u2019\n\nA little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:\nso she whispered to Frederick, \u2018I must throw the vinegar down.\u2019 \u2018Pray\ndon\u2019t,\u2019 answered he, \u2018it will discover us.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said\nshe, \u2018go it must.\u2019 So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves\nsaid, \u2018What a heavy dew there is!\u2019\n\nAt last it popped into Catherine\u2019s head that it was the door itself that\nwas so heavy all the time: so she whispered, \u2018Frederick, I must throw\nthe door down soon.\u2019 But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he\nwas sure it would betray them. \u2018Here goes, however,\u2019 said she: and down\nwent the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried\nout \u2018Murder!\u2019 and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they\ncould, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,\nthere they found all their money safe and sound.", "Sweetheart Roland": "There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\ndaughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was\nher own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,\nbecause she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty\napron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and\ntold her mother that she must and would have that apron. \u2018Be quiet, my\nchild,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018and you shall have it. Your stepsister has\nlong deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her\nhead off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and\npush her well to the front.\u2019 It would have been all over with the poor\ngirl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard\neverything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime\nhad come, the witch\u2019s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the\nfar side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the\nfront, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In\nthe night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right\nhand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,\nand then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child\u2019s\nhead off.\n\nWhen she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who\nwas called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said\nto him: \u2018Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother\nwanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,\nand she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 said Roland,\n\u2018I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape\nif she pursues us.\u2019 The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the\ndead girl\u2019s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in\nfront of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she\nhurried away with her lover.\n\nWhen the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\nwanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch\ncried: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,\u2019 answered\nthe first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the\nstairs, and cried again: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Here in the kitchen, I am\nwarming myself,\u2019 cried the second drop of blood. She went into the\nkitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\nhere in the bed, I am sleeping,\u2019 cried the third drop of blood. She went\ninto the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,\nwhose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into\na passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far\ninto the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her\nsweetheart Roland. \u2018That shall not help you,\u2019 cried she, \u2018even if you\nhave got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.\u2019 She put on her\nmany-league boots, in which she covered an hour\u2019s walk at every step,\nand it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when\nshe saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic\nwand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck\nswimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,\nthrew breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;\nbut the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to\ngo home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart\nRoland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole\nnight until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful\nflower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart\nRoland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up\ntowards them, and said to the musician: \u2018Dear musician, may I pluck that\nbeautiful flower for myself?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 he replied, \u2018I will play to\nyou while you do it.\u2019 As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was\njust going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower\nwas, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced\nto dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more\nviolent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes\nfrom her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he\ndid not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.\n\nAs they were now set free, Roland said: \u2018Now I will go to my father and\narrange for the wedding.\u2019 \u2018Then in the meantime I will stay here and\nwait for you,\u2019 said the girl, \u2018and that no one may recognize me, I will\nchange myself into a red stone landmark.\u2019 Then Roland went away, and the\ngirl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.\nBut when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so\nfascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a\nlong time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and\nchanged herself into a flower, and thought: \u2018Someone will surely come\nthis way, and trample me down.\u2019\n\nIt befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw\nthe flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and\nlaid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened\nin the shepherd\u2019s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was\nalready done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the\nfire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,\nwhen he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He\ncould not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being\nin his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was\ncertainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so\nafraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise\nwoman said: \u2018There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some\nmorning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no\nmatter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will\nbe stopped.\u2019\n\nThe shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,\nhe saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he\nsprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the\ntransformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,\nwho admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this\ntime she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,\nand as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she\nanswered: \u2018No,\u2019 for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart\nRoland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to\ngo away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.\n\nAnd now the time drew near when Roland\u2019s wedding was to be celebrated,\nand then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced\nthat all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the\nbridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad\nthat she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,\nbut the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,\nshe stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she\ncould not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland\u2019s\nears, he sprang up and cried: \u2018I know the voice, that is the true\nbride, I will have no other!\u2019 Everything he had forgotten, and which had\nvanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then\nthe faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and\ngrief came to an end and joy began.", "Snowdrop": "It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling\naround, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working\nat her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and\nas she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three\ndrops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red\ndrops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, \u2018Would that my little\ndaughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as\nblack as this ebony windowframe!\u2019 And so the little girl really did grow\nup; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and\nher hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.\n\nBut this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became\nqueen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear\nto think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy\nlooking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon\nherself in it, and say:\n\n \u2018Tell me, glass, tell me true!\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\u2019\n\nAnd the glass had always answered:\n\n \u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.\u2019\n\nBut Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years\nold she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.\nThen the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it\nas usual:\n\n \u2018Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,\n  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!\u2019\n\nWhen she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to\none of her servants, and said, \u2018Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,\nthat I may never see her any more.\u2019 Then the servant led her away; but\nhis heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he\nsaid, \u2018I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.\u2019 So he left her by\nherself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would\ntear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his\nheart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to\nher fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.\n\nThen poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and\nthe wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the\nevening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for\nher little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and\nneat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there\nwere seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses\nwith wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by\nthe wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked\na little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each\nglass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she\ntried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too\nshort, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself\ndown and went to sleep.\n\nBy and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little\ndwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.\nThey lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not\nright. The first said, \u2018Who has been sitting on my stool?\u2019 The second,\n\u2018Who has been eating off my plate?\u2019 The third, \u2018Who has been picking my\nbread?\u2019 The fourth, \u2018Who has been meddling with my spoon?\u2019 The fifth,\n\u2018Who has been handling my fork?\u2019 The sixth, \u2018Who has been cutting with\nmy knife?\u2019 The seventh, \u2018Who has been drinking my wine?\u2019 Then the first\nlooked round and said, \u2018Who has been lying on my bed?\u2019 And the rest came\nrunning to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his\nbed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come\nand see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought\ntheir lamps to look at her, and said, \u2018Good heavens! what a lovely child\nshe is!\u2019 And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake\nher; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs\nin turn, till the night was gone.\n\nIn the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,\nand said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and\nknit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would\ntake good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,\nseeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at\nhome; and they warned her, and said, \u2018The queen will soon find out where\nyou are, so take care and let no one in.\u2019\n\nBut the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she\nmust be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and\nsaid:\n\n \u2018Tell me, glass, tell me true!\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\u2019\n\nAnd the glass answered:\n\n \u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.\u2019\n\nThen the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass\nalways spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.\nAnd she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful\nthan she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went\nher way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she\nknocked at the door, and cried, \u2018Fine wares to sell!\u2019 Snowdrop looked\nout at the window, and said, \u2018Good day, good woman! what have you to\nsell?\u2019 \u2018Good wares, fine wares,\u2019 said she; \u2018laces and bobbins of all\ncolours.\u2019 \u2018I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good\nsort of body,\u2019 thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.\n\u2018Bless me!\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018how badly your stays are laced! Let me\nlace them up with one of my nice new laces.\u2019 Snowdrop did not dream of\nany mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work\nso nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop\u2019s breath was\nstopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. \u2018There\u2019s an end to all\nthy beauty,\u2019 said the spiteful queen, and went away home.\n\nIn the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how\ngrieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the\nground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when\nthey found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she\nbegan to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, \u2018The\nold woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one\nin when we are away.\u2019\n\nWhen the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it\nas before; but to her great grief it still said:\n\n \u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.\u2019\n\nThen the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that\nSnowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite\nanother dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned\ncomb. When she reached the dwarfs\u2019 cottage, she knocked at the door, and\ncried, \u2018Fine wares to sell!\u2019 But Snowdrop said, \u2018I dare not let anyone\nin.\u2019 Then the queen said, \u2018Only look at my beautiful combs!\u2019 and gave\nher the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and\nput it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,\nthe poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. \u2018There you may\nlie,\u2019 said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs\ncame in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on\nthe ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned\ncomb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that\nhad passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to\nanyone.\n\nMeantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she\nread the very same answer as before; and she said, \u2018Snowdrop shall die,\nif it cost me my life.\u2019 So she went by herself into her chamber, and got\nready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but\nwhoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a\npeasant\u2019s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs\u2019 cottage,\nand knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and\nsaid, \u2018I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.\u2019 \u2018Do\nas you please,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018but at any rate take this pretty\napple; I will give it you.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Snowdrop, \u2018I dare not take it.\u2019\n\u2018You silly girl!\u2019 answered the other, \u2018what are you afraid of? Do you\nthink it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the\nother.\u2019 Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the\nother side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for\nthe apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she\ncould wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,\nwhen she fell down dead upon the ground. \u2018This time nothing will save\nthee,\u2019 said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it\nsaid:\n\n \u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.\u2019\n\nAnd then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could\nbe.\n\nWhen evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop\nlying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid\nthat she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and\nwashed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little\ngirl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven\nwatched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they\nwould bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just\nas it did while she was alive; so they said, \u2018We will never bury her in\nthe cold ground.\u2019 And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might\nstill look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name\nwas, and that she was a king\u2019s daughter. And the coffin was set among\nthe hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the\nbirds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came\nan owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.\n\nAnd thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as\nthough she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red\nas blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the\ndwarfs\u2019 house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden\nletters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them\nto let him take her away; but they said, \u2018We will not part with her for\nall the gold in the world.\u2019 At last, however, they had pity on him, and\ngave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home\nwith him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop\nawoke, and said, \u2018Where am I?\u2019 And the prince said, \u2018Thou art quite safe\nwith me.\u2019\n\nThen he told her all that had happened, and said, \u2018I love you far better\nthan all the world; so come with me to my father\u2019s palace, and you shall\nbe my wife.\u2019 And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;\nand everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their\nwedding.\n\nTo the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop\u2019s old enemy the queen;\nand as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the\nglass and said:\n\n \u2018Tell me, glass, tell me true!\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\u2019\n\nAnd the glass answered:\n\n \u2018Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;\n  But lovelier far is the new-made queen.\u2019\n\nWhen she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity\nwere so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And\nwhen she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as\nshe thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell\ndown and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily\nover that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the\nmountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind\nto Snowdrop in her time of need.", "The Pink": "There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\nEvery morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\nbestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her\nand said: \u2018Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,\nso that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.\u2019 Then\nshe went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time\nwas come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.\n\nEvery morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild\nbeasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It\nhappened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in\nher arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the\nchild had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,\nand cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen\u2019s apron\nand on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place,\nwhere a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and\naccused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by\nthe wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed\nthis, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,\nin which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into\nit, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat\nor drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the\nshape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her\nfood until the seven years were over.\n\nThe cook, however, thought to himself: \u2018If the child has the power of\nwishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.\u2019 So\nhe left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to\nspeak, and said to him: \u2018Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with\na garden, and all else that pertains to it.\u2019 Scarcely were the words out\nof the boy\u2019s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.\nAfter a while the cook said to him: \u2018It is not well for you to be so\nalone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.\u2019 Then the king\u2019s son\nwished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more\nbeautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played\ntogether, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook\nwent out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however,\nthat the king\u2019s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus\nbring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside,\nand said: \u2018Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this\nknife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do\nnot do it, you shall lose your life.\u2019 Thereupon he went away, and when\nhe returned next day she had not done it, and said: \u2018Why should I shed\nthe blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?\u2019 The cook once\nmore said: \u2018If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.\u2019 When\nhe had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her\nto be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,\nand when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: \u2018Lie down in\nyour bed, and draw the clothes over you.\u2019 Then the wicked wretch came in\nand said: \u2018Where are the boy\u2019s heart and tongue?\u2019 The girl reached the\nplate to him, but the king\u2019s son threw off the quilt, and said: \u2018You old\nsinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence.\nYou shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,\nand shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your\nthroat.\u2019 And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\ninto a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\nwere ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\nflames broke forth from his throat. The king\u2019s son remained there a\nshort while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she\nwere still alive. At length he said to the maiden: \u2018I will go home to my\nown country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019\nshe replied, \u2018the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land\nwhere I am unknown?\u2019 As she did not seem quite willing, and as they\ncould not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed\ninto a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his\nown country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower\nin which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for\na ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and\nlooked inside, and cried: \u2018Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still\nalive, or are you dead?\u2019 She answered: \u2018I have just eaten, and am still\nsatisfied,\u2019 for she thought the angels were there. Said he: \u2018I am your\ndear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;\nbut I am alive still, and will soon set you free.\u2019 Then he descended\nagain, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a\nstrange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said\nyes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to\nhim, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the\ndistrict or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game\nfor him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all\nthe huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.\nAnd he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end\nwhere he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more\ncame running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.\nThen they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the\nking, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having\nhad none at all for years.\n\nNow the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\nhousehold should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When\nthey were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: \u2018As you are\nso clever, you shall sit by me.\u2019 He replied: \u2018Lord King, your majesty\nmust excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.\u2019 But the king insisted on it,\nand said: \u2018You shall sit by me,\u2019 until he did it. Whilst he was sitting\nthere, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the\nking\u2019s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how\nit was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,\nor had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,\nand said: \u2018Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen\nliving in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?\u2019 But the king\nreplied: \u2018She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will\nnot have her named.\u2019 Then the huntsman arose and said: \u2018Gracious lord\nfather she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away\nby wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her\narms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a\nchicken.\u2019 Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:\n\u2018That is the wretch!\u2019 and caused live coals to be brought, and these the\ndog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst\nforth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would\nlike to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form\nof the cook, in the which he stood immediately, with his white apron,\nand his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion,\nand ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman\nspoke further and said: \u2018Father, will you see the maiden who brought me\nup so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,\nthough her own life depended on it?\u2019 The king replied: \u2018Yes, I would\nlike to see her.\u2019 The son said: \u2018Most gracious father, I will show her\nto you in the form of a beautiful flower,\u2019 and he thrust his hand into\nhis pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,\nand it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.\nThen the son said: \u2018Now will I show her to you in her own form,\u2019 and\nwished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so\nbeautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.\n\nAnd the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,\nto fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was\nled in she ate nothing, and said: \u2018The gracious and merciful God who has\nsupported me in the tower, will soon set me free.\u2019 She lived three days\nmore, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white\ndoves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of\nheaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged\nking ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the\nking\u2019s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden\nwhom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they\nare still alive or not, is known to God.", "Clever Elsie": "There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And\nwhen she had grown up her father said: \u2018We will get her married.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019\nsaid the mother, \u2018if only someone would come who would have her.\u2019 At\nlength a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;\nbut he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said\nthe father, \u2018she has plenty of good sense\u2019; and the mother said: \u2018Oh,\nshe can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Hans, \u2018if she is not really smart, I won\u2019t have her.\u2019 When\nthey were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: \u2018Elsie, go\ninto the cellar and fetch some beer.\u2019 Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher\nfrom the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she\nwent, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she\nfetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had\nno need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected\ninjury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and\nwhile the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but\nlooked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a\npick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left\nthere.\n\nThen Clever Elsie began to weep and said: \u2018If I get Hans, and we have\na child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw\nbeer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.\u2019 Then she\nsat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the\nmisfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,\nbut Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:\n\u2018Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.\u2019 The maid went and\nfound her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. \u2018Elsie why\ndo you weep?\u2019 asked the maid. \u2018Ah,\u2019 she answered, \u2018have I not reason to\nweep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to\ndraw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill\nhim.\u2019 Then said the maid: \u2018What a clever Elsie we have!\u2019 and sat down\nbeside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,\nas the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the\nbeer, the man said to the boy: \u2018Just go down into the cellar and see\nwhere Elsie and the girl are.\u2019 The boy went down, and there sat Clever\nElsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: \u2018Why are you\nweeping?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Elsie, \u2018have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,\nand we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the\npick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.\u2019 Then said the boy: \u2018What\na clever Elsie we have!\u2019 and sat down by her, and likewise began to\nhowl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not\nreturn, the man said to the woman: \u2018Just go down into the cellar and see\nwhere Elsie is!\u2019 The woman went down, and found all three in the midst\nof their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told\nher also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it\ngrew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the\nmother likewise: \u2018What a clever Elsie we have!\u2019 and sat down and wept\nwith them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not\ncome back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: \u2018I must go into the\ncellar myself and see where Elsie is.\u2019 But when he got into the cellar,\nand they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and\nthat Elsie\u2019s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one\ninto the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if\nhe should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very\ntime when it fell down, he cried: \u2018Oh, what a clever Elsie!\u2019 and sat\ndown, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone\nfor a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: \u2018They must be\nwaiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.\u2019\nWhen he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting\nquite piteously, each out-doing the other. \u2018What misfortune has happened\nthen?\u2019 asked he. \u2018Ah, dear Hans,\u2019 said Elsie, \u2018if we marry each other\nand have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw\nsomething to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might\ndash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to\nweep?\u2019 \u2018Come,\u2019 said Hans, \u2018more understanding than that is not needed\nfor my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,\u2019 and\nseized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\n\nAfter Hans had had her some time, he said: \u2018Wife, I am going out to work\nand earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we\nmay have some bread.\u2019 \u2018Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.\u2019 After Hans had\ngone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field\nwith her. When she came to the field she said to herself: \u2018What shall I\ndo; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.\u2019 Then\nshe drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once\nmore said: \u2018What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?\nI will sleep first.\u2019 Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.\nHans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said\nhe: \u2018What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not\neven come home to eat.\u2019 But when evening came and she still stayed away,\nHans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she\nwas lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought\na fowler\u2019s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she\nstill went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat\ndown in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever\nElsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about\nher, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was\nalarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or\nnot, and said: \u2018Is it I, or is it not I?\u2019 But she knew not what answer\nto make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:\n\u2018I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure\nto know.\u2019 She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then\nshe knocked at the window and cried: \u2018Hans, is Elsie within?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019\nanswered Hans, \u2018she is within.\u2019 Hereupon she was terrified, and said:\n\u2018Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,\u2019 and went to another door; but when the\npeople heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she\ncould get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has\nseen her since.", "The Miser in the Bush": "A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for\nhim three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came\ninto the man\u2019s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;\nso he went to his master, and said, \u2018I have worked hard for you a long\ntime, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my\ntrouble.\u2019 The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very\nsimple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year\u2019s\nservice a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to\nhave, and said to himself, \u2018Why should I work hard, and live here on bad\nfare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself\nmerry.\u2019 With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming\nover hill and valley.\n\nAs he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf\nmet him, and asked him what made him so merry. \u2018Why, what should make\nme down-hearted?\u2019 said he; \u2018I am sound in health and rich in purse, what\nshould I care for? I have saved up my three years\u2019 earnings and have it\nall safe in my pocket.\u2019 \u2018How much may it come to?\u2019 said the little man.\n\u2018Full threepence,\u2019 replied the countryman. \u2018I wish you would give them\nto me,\u2019 said the other; \u2018I am very poor.\u2019 Then the man pitied him, and\ngave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, \u2018As you have\nsuch a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every\npenny; so choose whatever you like.\u2019 Then the countryman rejoiced at\nhis good luck, and said, \u2018I like many things better than money: first, I\nwill have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,\na fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and\nthirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.\u2019 The dwarf\nsaid he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,\nand went his way.\n\nOur honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,\nhe was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old\nmiser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush\nsinging away most joyfully. \u2018Oh, what a pretty bird!\u2019 said the miser; \u2018I\nwould give a great deal of money to have such a one.\u2019 \u2018If that\u2019s all,\u2019\nsaid the countryman, \u2018I will soon bring it down.\u2019 Then he took up his\nbow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.\nThe miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into\nthe middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the\nmiser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in\nthe air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung\nin rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that\nthe blood ran down. \u2018Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake!\u2019 cried the miser, \u2018Master!\nmaster! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?\u2019\n\u2018Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,\u2019 said the other; \u2018thou\nart only meeting thy reward\u2019: so he played up another tune. Then the\nmiser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but\nhe did not come up to the musician\u2019s price for some time, and he danced\nhim along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till\nat last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,\nand had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman\nsaw so much money, he said, \u2018I will agree to your proposal.\u2019 So he took\nthe purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his\nbargain.\n\nMeanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\nplight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve\nhis late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and\ncomplained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him\ninto the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his\nback and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his\nofficers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he\nwas soon caught and brought up to be tried.\n\nThe miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of\nhis money. \u2018No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.\u2019 said the\ncountryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the\nmatter short by ordering him off to the gallows.\n\nSo away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, \u2018My Lord\nJudge, grant me one last request.\u2019 \u2018Anything but thy life,\u2019 replied the\nother. \u2018No,\u2019 said he, \u2018I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon\nmy fiddle for the last time.\u2019 The miser cried out, \u2018Oh, no! no! for\nheaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t listen to him! don\u2019t listen to him!\u2019 But the judge\nsaid, \u2018It is only this once, he will soon have done.\u2019 The fact was, he\ncould not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf\u2019s third gift.\n\nThen the miser said, \u2018Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity\u2019s sake.\u2019 But\nthe countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first\nnote judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and\nno one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his\nprisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first\nbar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and\nall the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry\nand pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed\nto be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him\nto leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,\ntill the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him\nthe hundred florins.\n\nThen he called to the miser, and said, \u2018Tell us now, you vagabond, where\nyou got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,\u2019 \u2018I stole\nit,\u2019 said the miser in the presence of all the people; \u2018I acknowledge\nthat I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.\u2019 Then the countryman\nstopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.", "Ashputtel": "The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew\nnigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, \u2018Always be\na good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.\u2019 Soon\nafterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;\nand the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always\ngood and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful\nwhite covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the\nsun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This\nnew wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;\nthey were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time\nfor the poor little girl. \u2018What does the good-for-nothing want in the\nparlour?\u2019 said they; \u2018they who would eat bread should first earn it;\naway with the kitchen-maid!\u2019 Then they took away her fine clothes, and\ngave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her\ninto the kitchen.\n\nThere she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to\nbring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,\nthe sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the\nevening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made\nto lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her\nalways dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.\n\nIt happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his\nwife\u2019s daughters what he should bring them. \u2018Fine clothes,\u2019 said the\nfirst; \u2018Pearls and diamonds,\u2019 cried the second. \u2018Now, child,\u2019 said he\nto his own daughter, \u2018what will you have?\u2019 \u2018The first twig, dear\nfather, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come\nhomewards,\u2019 said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes\nand pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he\nrode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost\npushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he\ngot home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to\nher mother\u2019s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was\nwatered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three\ntimes every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came\nand built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over\nher, and brought her whatever she wished for.\n\nNow it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to\nlast three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose\na bride for himself. Ashputtel\u2019s two sisters were asked to come; so they\ncalled her up, and said, \u2018Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie\nour sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king\u2019s feast.\u2019\nThen she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help\ncrying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have\ngone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard\nto let her go. \u2018You, Ashputtel!\u2019 said she; \u2018you who have nothing to\nwear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to\nthe ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of\nher, \u2018I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in\ntwo hours\u2019 time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast\ntoo.\u2019\n\nThen she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran\nout at the back door into the garden, and cried out:\n\n \u2018Hither, hither, through the sky,\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\n  One and all come help me, quick!\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!\u2019\n\nThen first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next\ncame two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\nheaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.\nAnd the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,\npick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among\nthem all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish\nbut left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite\ndone, and all flew out again at the windows.\n\nThen Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought\nthat now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, \u2018No, no! you\nslut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.\u2019 And when\nAshputtel begged very hard to go, she said, \u2018If you can in one hour\u2019s\ntime pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go\ntoo.\u2019 And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she\nshook two dishes of peas into the ashes.\n\nBut the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,\nand cried out as before:\n\n \u2018Hither, hither, through the sky,\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\n  One and all come help me, quick!\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!\u2019\n\nThen first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two\nturtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,\nchirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the\nlittle doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and\nthen the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain\ninto the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour\u2019s time all\nwas done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to\nher mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.\nBut her mother said, \u2018It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no\nclothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame\u2019: and off\nshe went with her two daughters to the ball.\n\nNow when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went\nsorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:\n\n \u2018Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\n  Gold and silver over me!\u2019\n\nThen her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and\nsilver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them\non, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,\nand thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and\nbeautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,\ntaking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.\n\nThe king\u2019s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced\nwith her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone\nelse came to ask her to dance, he said, \u2018This lady is dancing with me.\u2019\n\nThus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to\ngo home: and the king\u2019s son said, \u2018I shall go and take care of you to\nyour home\u2019; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But\nshe slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as\nthe prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut\nthe door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that\nthe unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the\npigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one\nwithin; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as\nshe always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little\nlamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could\nthrough the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken\noff her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird\nmight carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her\nlittle grey frock.\n\nThe next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and\nsisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:\n\n \u2018Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\n  Gold and silver over me!\u2019\n\nAnd the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she\nhad worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone\nwondered at her beauty: but the king\u2019s son, who was waiting for her,\ntook her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to\ndance, he said as before, \u2018This lady is dancing with me.\u2019\n\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king\u2019s son followed here\nas before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang\naway from him all at once into the garden behind her father\u2019s house.\nIn this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and\nAshputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without\nbeing seen. Then the king\u2019s son lost sight of her, and could not find\nout where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said\nto him, \u2018The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I\nthink she must have sprung into the pear-tree.\u2019 The father thought to\nhimself, \u2018Can it be Ashputtel?\u2019 So he had an axe brought; and they cut\ndown the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into\nthe kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped\ndown on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes\nback to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey\nfrock.\n\nThe third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she\nwent again into the garden, and said:\n\n \u2018Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\n  Gold and silver over me!\u2019\n\nThen her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the\nformer one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came\nto the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the\nking\u2019s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to\ndance, he said, \u2018This lady is _my_ partner, sir.\u2019\n\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king\u2019s son would go with\nher, and said to himself, \u2018I will not lose her this time\u2019; but, however,\nshe again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped\nher left golden slipper upon the stairs.\n\nThe prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,\nand said, \u2018I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper\nfits.\u2019 Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they\nhad beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden\nslipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and\nwanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could\nnot go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then\nthe mother gave her a knife, and said, \u2018Never mind, cut it off; when you\nare queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.\u2019 So\nthe silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,\nand went to the king\u2019s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her\nbeside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.\n\nBut on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel\nhad planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:\n\n \u2018Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\n  For she\u2019s not the true one that sits by thy side.\u2019\n\nThen the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the\nblood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he\nturned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,\nand said, \u2018This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put\non the slipper.\u2019 Then she went into the room and got her foot into the\nshoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it\nin till the blood came, and took her to the king\u2019s son: and he set her\nas his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.\n\nBut when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,\nand sang:\n\n \u2018Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\n  For she\u2019s not the true one that sits by thy side.\u2019\n\nThen he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the\nshoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse\nand brought her also back again. \u2018This is not the true bride,\u2019 said he\nto the father; \u2018have you no other daughters?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said he; \u2018there is\nonly a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am\nsure she cannot be the bride.\u2019 The prince told him to send her. But the\nmother said, \u2018No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show\nherself.\u2019 However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed\nher face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached\nher the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,\nand put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made\nfor her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and\nsaid, \u2018This is the right bride.\u2019 But the mother and both the sisters\nwere frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his\nhorse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the\nwhite dove sang:\n\n \u2018Home! home! look at the shoe!\n  Princess! the shoe was made for you!\n  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,\n  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!\u2019\n\nAnd when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon\nher right shoulder, and so went home with her.", "The White Snake": "A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through\nall the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of\nthe most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a\nstrange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,\nand no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more\ndish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what\nwas in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the\ncover to eat of it until he was quite alone.\n\nThis had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took\naway the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help\ncarrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,\nhe lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But\nwhen he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,\nso he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it\ntouched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices\noutside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was\nthe sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of\nall kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating\nthe snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.\n\nNow it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most\nbeautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty\nservant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to\nbe brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he\ncould before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked\nupon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was\ndismissed with no better answer.\n\nIn his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought\nhow to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting\ntogether quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they\nwere making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a\nconfidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.\nThey were telling one another of all the places where they had been\nwaddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and\none said in a pitiful tone: \u2018Something lies heavy on my stomach; as\nI was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen\u2019s\nwindow.\u2019 The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the\nkitchen, and said to the cook: \u2018Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; \u2018she has spared\nno trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long\nenough.\u2019 So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the\nspit, the queen\u2019s ring was found inside her.\n\nThe servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make\namends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him\nthe best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused\neverything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as\nhe had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request\nwas granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he\nsaw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though\nit is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must\nperish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his\nhorse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with\ndelight, put out their heads, and cried to him: \u2018We will remember you\nand repay you for saving us!\u2019\n\nHe rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\nthe sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: \u2018Why\ncannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid\nhorse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without\nmercy!\u2019 So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to\nhim: \u2018We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!\u2019\n\nThe path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing\nby their nest, and throwing out their young ones. \u2018Out with you, you\nidle, good-for-nothing creatures!\u2019 cried they; \u2018we cannot find food for\nyou any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.\u2019\nBut the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and\ncrying: \u2018Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,\nand yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?\u2019 So the\ngood young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave\nit to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their\nhunger, and cried: \u2018We will remember you--one good turn deserves\nanother!\u2019\n\nAnd now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long\nway, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in\nthe streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: \u2018The king\u2019s\ndaughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard\ntask, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.\u2019 Many had\nalready made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth\nsaw the king\u2019s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he\nforgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\n\nSo he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before\nhis eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the\nbottom of the sea, and added: \u2018If you come up again without it you will\nbe thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.\u2019 All the\npeople grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him\nalone by the sea.\n\nHe stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly\nhe saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very\nfishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in\nits mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth\u2019s feet, and when he\nhad taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.\nFull of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him\nthe promised reward.\n\nBut when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in\nbirth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another\ntask. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten\nsacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: \u2018Tomorrow morning\nbefore sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be\nwanting.\u2019\n\nThe youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible\nto perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat\nsorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.\nBut as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw\nall the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single\ngrain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands\nand thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry\npicked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.\n\nPresently the king\u2019s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was\namazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.\nBut she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: \u2018Although he\nhas performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had\nbrought me an apple from the Tree of Life.\u2019 The youth did not know where\nthe Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,\nas long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding\nit. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to\na wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in\nthe branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time\nthree ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and\nsaid: \u2018We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when\nwe had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,\nwe flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life\nstands, and have brought you the apple.\u2019 The youth, full of joy, set out\nhomewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king\u2019s beautiful daughter,\nwho had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in\ntwo and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,\nand they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.", "The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids": "There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\nloved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she\nwanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all\nseven to her and said: \u2018Dear children, I have to go into the forest,\nbe on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you\nall--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but\nyou will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.\u2019 The\nkids said: \u2018Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go\naway without any anxiety.\u2019 Then the old one bleated, and went on her way\nwith an easy mind.\n\nIt was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:\n\u2018Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought\nsomething back with her for each of you.\u2019 But the little kids knew that\nit was the wolf, by the rough voice. \u2018We will not open the door,\u2019 cried\nthey, \u2018you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but\nyour voice is rough; you are the wolf!\u2019 Then the wolf went away to a\nshopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made\nhis voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the\nhouse, and called: \u2018Open the door, dear children, your mother is here\nand has brought something back with her for each of you.\u2019 But the wolf\nhad laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them\nand cried: \u2018We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet\nlike you: you are the wolf!\u2019 Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: \u2018I\nhave hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.\u2019 And when the baker\nhad rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: \u2018Strew some\nwhite meal over my feet for me.\u2019 The miller thought to himself: \u2018The\nwolf wants to deceive someone,\u2019 and refused; but the wolf said: \u2018If you\nwill not do it, I will devour you.\u2019 Then the miller was afraid, and made\nhis paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.\n\nSo now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at\nit and said: \u2018Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother\nhas come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the\nforest with her.\u2019 The little kids cried: \u2018First show us your paws that\nwe may know if you are our dear little mother.\u2019 Then he put his paws\nin through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they\nbelieved that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should\ncome in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.\nOne sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the\nstove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the\nsixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But\nthe wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the\nother he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in\nthe clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had\nsatisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a\ntree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards\nthe old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw\nthere! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches\nwere thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts\nand pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they\nwere nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but\nno one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice\ncried: \u2018Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.\u2019 She took the kid out, and\nit told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then\nyou may imagine how she wept over her poor children.\n\nAt length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.\nWhen they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored\nso loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and\nsaw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. \u2018Ah,\nheavens,\u2019 she said, \u2018is it possible that my poor children whom he has\nswallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?\u2019 Then the kid had to\nrun home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut\nopen the monster\u2019s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one\nlittle kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six\nsprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered\nno injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them\ndown whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,\nand jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: \u2018Now\ngo and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast\u2019s\nstomach with them while he is still asleep.\u2019 Then the seven kids dragged\nthe stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this\nstomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the\ngreatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once\nstirred.\n\nWhen the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,\nand as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to\ngo to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the\nstones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried\nhe:\n\n \u2018What rumbles and tumbles\n  Against my poor bones?\n  I thought \u2018twas six kids,\n  But it feels like big stones.\u2019\n\nAnd when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the\nheavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven\nkids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: \u2018The wolf\nis dead! The wolf is dead!\u2019 and danced for joy round about the well with\ntheir mother.", "The Queen Bee": "Two kings\u2019 sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their\nfortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so\nthat they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a\nlittle insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when\nhe had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so\nyoung and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who\nwere so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set\nout on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two\nelder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor\nants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the\nlittle dwarf said, \u2018Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not\nsuffer you to trouble them.\u2019\n\nSo on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming\nabout. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the\ndwarf said, \u2018Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill\nthem.\u2019 Next they came to a bees\u2019-nest in a hollow tree, and there was\nso much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to\nlight a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.\nBut the dwarf held them back, and said, \u2018Let the pretty insects enjoy\nthemselves, I cannot let you burn them.\u2019\n\nAt length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the\nstables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and\nno man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they\ncame to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door\nwas a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw\na little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or\ntwice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then\nhe rose and came out to them.\n\nHe said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful\ntable covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and\ndrunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.\n\nThe next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,\nwhere there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by\nwhich the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: \u2018In the\nwood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king\u2019s\ndaughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,\nhe who seeks them will be turned into marble.\u2019\n\nThe eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:\nbut the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was\nturned into stone as the tablet had foretold.\n\nThe next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no\nbetter than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the\npearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.\n\nAt last came the little dwarf\u2019s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it\nwas so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat\ndown upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants\n(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and\nit was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a\nheap.\n\nThe second tablet said: \u2018The key of the princess\u2019s bed-chamber must be\nfished up out of the lake.\u2019 And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,\nhe saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they\ndived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.\n\nThe third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and\nthe best of the king\u2019s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and\nall exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of\nsugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;\nso he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.\n\nThen came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf\nfrom the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat\nupon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew\nwhich was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been\nturned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf\nmarried the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after\nher father\u2019s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.", "The Elves and the Shoemaker": "There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:\nbut still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he\nhad in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of\nshoes.\n\nThen he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning\nto rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and\nhis heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,\nleft all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after\nhe had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his\ngreat wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The\ngood man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.\nHe looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the\nwhole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.\n\nThe same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that\nhe willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor\nshoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.\nIn the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might\nget up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for\nwhen he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon\nin came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought\nleather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight\nand found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some\ntime: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and\nthe good man soon became thriving and well off again.\n\nOne evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over\nthe fire chatting together, he said to her, \u2018I should like to sit up and\nwatch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for\nme.\u2019 The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid\nthemselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up\nthere, and watched what would happen.\n\nAs soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and\nthey sat themselves upon the shoemaker\u2019s bench, took up all the work\nthat was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching\nand rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all\nwonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the\njob was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.\nThis was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as\nlightning.\n\nThe next day the wife said to the shoemaker. \u2018These little wights have\nmade us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good\nturn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and\nindeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to\nkeep off the cold. I\u2019ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,\nand a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and\ndo you make each of them a little pair of shoes.\u2019\n\nThe thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when\nall the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the\nwork that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to\nwatch what the little elves would do.\n\nAbout midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the\nroom, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they\nsaw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed\nmightily delighted.\n\nThen they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and\ncapered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced\nout at the door, and away over the green.\n\nThe good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them\nfrom that time forward, as long as they lived.", "The Juniper-Tree": "Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich\nman with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but\nsorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire\nto have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they\nremained childless.\n\nIn front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.\nOne winter\u2019s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and\nas she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the\nsnow. \u2018Ah,\u2019 sighed the woman heavily, \u2018if I had but a child, as red as\nblood and as white as snow,\u2019 and as she spoke the words, her heart grew\nlight within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and\nshe returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,\nand the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all\nthe earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the\ntrees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly\nintertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife\nstood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her\nheart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that\nshe fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and\nshe was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the\nberries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little\nwhile later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. \u2018If I\ndie, bury me under the juniper-tree.\u2019 Then she felt comforted and happy\nagain, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and\nwhen she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy\nwas so great that she died.\n\nHer husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for\nher. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he\nstill grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later\non he married again.\n\nHe now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife\nwas a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother\nloved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked\nat the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in\nthe way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could\nget the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession\nof her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She\ndrove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the\npoor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left\nschool to the time he went back.\n\nOne day the little daughter came running to her mother in the\nstore-room, and said, \u2018Mother, give me an apple.\u2019 \u2018Yes, my child,\u2019 said\nthe wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest\nhad a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.\n\n\u2018Mother,\u2019 said the little daughter again, \u2018may not brother have one\ntoo?\u2019 The mother was angry at this, but she answered, \u2018Yes, when he\ncomes out of school.\u2019\n\nJust then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed\nas if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out\nof her little daughter\u2019s hand, and said, \u2018You shall not have one before\nyour brother.\u2019 She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The\nlittle boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say\nkindly to him, \u2018My son, will you have an apple?\u2019 but she gave him a\nwicked look. \u2018Mother,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018how dreadful you look! Yes, give\nme an apple.\u2019 The thought came to her that she would kill him. \u2018Come\nwith me,\u2019 she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; \u2018take one\nout for yourself.\u2019 And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged\nher, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy\u2019s head.\nThen she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.\n\u2018If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,\u2019 she thought. So\nshe went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of\nher top drawer; then she set the boy\u2019s head again on his shoulders, and\nbound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed\nhim on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.\n\nSoon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring\na pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, \u2018Mother, brother is\nsitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;\nand when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that\nfrightened me.\u2019\n\n\u2018Go to him again,\u2019 said her mother, \u2018and if he does not answer, give him\na box on the ear.\u2019 So little Marleen went, and said, \u2018Brother, give me\nthat apple,\u2019 but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the\near, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran\ncrying and screaming to her mother. \u2018Oh!\u2019 she said, \u2018I have knocked off\nbrother\u2019s head,\u2019 and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.\n\n\u2018What have you done!\u2019 said her mother, \u2018but no one must know about it,\nso you must keep silence; what is done can\u2019t be undone; we will make\nhim into puddings.\u2019 And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him\ninto puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,\nand wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no\nneed of salt.\n\nPresently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,\n\u2018Where is my son?\u2019 The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of\nblack pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.\n\nThe father again asked, \u2018Where is my son?\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 answered the wife, \u2018he is gone into the country to his mother\u2019s\ngreat uncle; he is going to stay there some time.\u2019\n\n\u2018What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six\nweeks; he is well looked after there.\u2019\n\n\u2018I feel very unhappy about it,\u2019 said the husband, \u2018in case it should not\nbe all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.\u2019\n\nWith this he went on with his dinner, and said, \u2018Little Marleen, why do\nyou weep? Brother will soon be back.\u2019 Then he asked his wife for more\npudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.\n\nLittle Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of\nher bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the\ntable and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but\nweep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and\nshe had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,\nand she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the\nbranches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and\nthen together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for\njoy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there\nwas a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful\nbird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it\ncould no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the\nsilk handkerchief and the bones were gone.\n\nLittle Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were\nstill alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to\nthe table and ate.\n\nThe bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to\nsing:\n\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\n\nThe goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the\nsong of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got\nup and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his\nslippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on\none foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still\nheld the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing\nup at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.\n\n\u2018Bird,\u2019 he said, \u2018how beautifully you sing!

the bird threw the millstone\ndown on her head, and she was crushed to death.\n\nThe father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only\nsaw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had\npassed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and\nlittle Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went\ninside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.", "The Turnip": "There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and\nthe other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,\npulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,\nand sowed turnips.\n\nWhen the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and\nit kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease\ngrowing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for\nthere never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it\nwas so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and\nthe gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it\nwould be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, \u2018What\nshall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;\nand for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing\nperhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.\u2019\n\nThen he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it\nto the king. \u2018What a wonderful thing!\u2019 said the king; \u2018I have seen many\nstrange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you\nget the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child\nof fortune.\u2019 \u2018Ah, no!\u2019 answered the gardener, \u2018I am no child of fortune;\nI am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I\nlaid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a\nbrother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world\nknows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.\u2019\n\nThe king then took pity on him, and said, \u2018You shall be poor no\nlonger. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your\nbrother.\u2019 Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so\nrich that his brother\u2019s fortune could not at all be compared with his.\n\nWhen the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the\ngardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he\ncould contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he\ndetermined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a\nrich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must\nhave a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so\nmuch for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?\n\nThe king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to\ngive in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so\nthe soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.\nWhen he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;\nand at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to\nkill his brother.\n\nSo he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to\nlie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, \u2018Dear brother, I have\nfound a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between\nus.\u2019 The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out\ntogether, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out\nupon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.\n\nBut whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a\nhorse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their\nprisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a\ncord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime\nhe worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out\nhis head.\n\nWhen the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,\nwho was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as\nthe man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, \u2018Good\nmorning! good morning to thee, my friend!\u2019 The student looked about\neverywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came\nfrom, cried out, \u2018Who calls me?\u2019\n\nThen the man in the tree answered, \u2018Lift up thine eyes, for behold here\nI sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great\nand wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the\nschools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man\ncan know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here\nI discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws\nthat control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the\nhealing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of\nprecious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel\nand own the power of knowledge.\n\nThe student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,\n\u2018Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to\nlet me into the sack for a little while?\u2019 Then the other answered, as if\nvery unwillingly, \u2018A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou\nwilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an\nhour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown\nto me.\u2019\n\nSo the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung\nheavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,\nfor his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give\nway, and said, \u2018Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying\nyonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.\u2019 So the student let him down,\nopened the sack, and set him free. \u2018Now then,\u2019 cried he, \u2018let me ascend\nquickly.\u2019 As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, \u2018Wait a\nwhile,\u2019 said the gardener, \u2018that is not the way.\u2019 Then he pushed him\nin head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after\nwisdom dangling in the air. \u2018How is it with thee, friend?\u2019 said he,\n\u2018dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace,\ntill thou art a wiser man than thou wert.\u2019\n\nSo saying, he trotted off on the student\u2019s nag, and left the poor fellow\nto gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.", "Clever Hans": "The mother of Hans said: \u2018Whither away, Hans?\u2019 Hans answered: \u2018To\nGretel.\u2019 \u2018Behave well, Hans.\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll behave well.

You must go from\nhence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall\nsee what he can do with you.\u2019 The youth was sent into a strange town,\nand remained a whole year with the master.

I\nwill send you into another town, to another master.\u2019 The youth was taken\nthither, and stayed a year with this master likewise.

I will\nsend you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I\nwill no longer be your father.\u2019 The youth remained a whole year with the\nthird master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired:\n\u2018My son, what have you learnt?\u2019 he answered: \u2018Dear father, I have this\nyear learnt what the frogs croak.\u2019 Then the father fell into the most\nfurious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: \u2018This man\nis no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him\nout into the forest, and kill him.\u2019 They took him forth, but when they\nshould have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go,\nand they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry\nthem to the old man as a token.\n\nThe youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he\nbegged for a night\u2019s lodging. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the lord of the castle, \u2018if\nyou will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I\nwarn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs,\nwhich bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to\nbe given to them, whom they at once devour.\u2019 The whole district was in\nsorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to\nstop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: \u2018Just let me\ngo down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to\nthem; they will do nothing to harm me.\u2019 As he himself would have it so,\nthey gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the\ntower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged\ntheir tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and\ndid not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of\neveryone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of\nthe castle: \u2018The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why\nthey dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and\nare obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower,\nand they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise\nlearnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.\u2019 Then all who\nheard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him\nas a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and\nas he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest\nfull of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth\nheard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the\ntrouble.\n\nAfter some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On\nthe way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting\ncroaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they\nwere saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in\nRome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among\nthe cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at\nlength agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be\ndistinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was\ndecided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two\nsnow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The\necclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on\nthe spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were\nworthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he\nsaid yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled\nwhat he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him,\nthat he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and\ndid not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his\nshoulders, and said it all in his ear.", "The Fox and the Cat": "It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to\nherself: \u2018He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the\nworld,\u2019 she spoke to him in a friendly way. \u2018Good day, dear Mr Fox,\nhow are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard\ntimes?\u2019 The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from\nhead to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give\nany answer or not. At last he said: \u2018Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you\npiebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have\nyou the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How\nmany arts do you understand?\u2019 \u2018I understand but one,\u2019 replied the\ncat, modestly. \u2018What art is that?\u2019 asked the fox. \u2018When the hounds are\nfollowing me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.\u2019 \u2018Is that all?\u2019\nsaid the fox. \u2018I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain\na sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will\nteach you how people get away from the hounds.\u2019 Just then came a hunter\nwith four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top\nof it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. \u2018Open your\nsack, Mr Fox, open your sack,\u2019 cried the cat to him, but the dogs had\nalready seized him, and were holding him fast. \u2018Ah, Mr Fox,\u2019 cried the\ncat. \u2018You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been\nable to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.\u2019", "The Four Clever Brothers": "\u2018Dear children,\u2019 said a poor man to his four sons, \u2018I have nothing to\ngive you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin\nby learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.\u2019 So the\nfour brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little\nbundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went\nall out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came\nto four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest\nsaid, \u2018Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back\nto this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for\nhimself.\u2019\n\nSo each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man\nmet him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. \u2018I am\ngoing to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning\nsome art or trade,\u2019 answered he. \u2018Then,\u2019 said the man, \u2018go with me, and\nI will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019\nsaid the other, \u2018that is not an honest calling, and what can one look\nto earn by it in the end but the gallows?\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 said the man, \u2018you need\nnot fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be\nfair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care\nanything about, and where no one can find you out.\u2019 So the young man\nagreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that\nnothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.\n\nThe second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was\nsetting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. \u2018I do not\nknow yet,\u2019 said he. \u2018Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a\nnoble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand\nthe stars.\u2019 The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful\nstar-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave\nhis master, he gave him a glass, and said, \u2018With this you can see all\nthat is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from\nyou.\u2019\n\nThe third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him\nso well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the\ncraft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and\nsaid, \u2018Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.\u2019\n\nThe youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to\ndo. \u2018Would not you like,\u2019 said he, \u2018to be a tailor?\u2019 \u2018Oh, no!\u2019 said\nthe young man; \u2018sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working\nbackwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.\u2019\n\u2018Oh!\u2019 answered the man, \u2018that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,\nand you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.\u2019 Not knowing\nwhat better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the\nbeginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,\n\u2018You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as\nsteel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.\u2019\n\nAfter the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four\nbrothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,\nset off towards their father\u2019s home, where they told him all that had\nhappened to them, and how each had learned some craft.\n\nThen, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high\ntree, the father said, \u2018I should like to try what each of you can do in\nthis way.\u2019 So he looked up, and said to the second son, \u2018At the top of\nthis tree there is a chaffinch\u2019s nest; tell me how many eggs there are\nin it.\u2019 The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, \u2018Five.\u2019\n\u2018Now,\u2019 said the father to the eldest son, \u2018take away the eggs without\nletting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know\nanything of what you are doing.\u2019 So the cunning thief climbed up the\ntree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;\nand it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its\nease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the\ntable, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, \u2018Cut all\nthe eggs in two pieces at one shot.\u2019 The huntsman took up his bow, and\nat one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.\n\n\u2018Now comes your turn,\u2019 said he to the young tailor; \u2018sew the eggs and\nthe young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall\nhave done them no harm.\u2019 Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the\neggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take\nthem back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing\nit. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they\ncrawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where\nthe tailor had sewn them together.\n\n\u2018Well done, sons!\u2019 said the old man; \u2018you have made good use of your\ntime, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not\nknow which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for\nyou to turn your skill to some account!\u2019\n\nNot long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the\nking\u2019s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king\nmourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever\nbrought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four\nbrothers said to each other, \u2018Here is a chance for us; let us try\nwhat we can do.\u2019 And they agreed to see whether they could not set the\nprincess free. \u2018I will soon find out where she is, however,\u2019 said the\nstar-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, \u2018I\nsee her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the\ndragon close by, guarding her.\u2019 Then he went to the king, and asked for\na ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the\nsea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess\nsitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was\nlying asleep, with his head upon her lap. \u2018I dare not shoot at him,\u2019\nsaid the huntsman, \u2018for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.\u2019\n\u2018Then I will try my skill,\u2019 said the thief, and went and stole her away\nfrom under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know\nit, but went on snoring.\n\nThen away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the\nship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for\nhe awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and\nwanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took\nup his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down\ndead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in\nhis fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea\nupon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large\nstitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,\nand sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked\nthem together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then\nreached the ship and got home safe.\n\nWhen they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great\nrejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, \u2018One of you shall marry\nher, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.\u2019 Then\nthere arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, \u2018If I had\nnot found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;\ntherefore she ought to be mine.\u2019 \u2018Your seeing her would have been of\nno use,\u2019 said the thief, \u2018if I had not taken her away from the dragon;\ntherefore she ought to be mine.\u2019 \u2018No, she is mine,\u2019 said the huntsman;\n\u2018for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you\nand the princess into pieces.\u2019 \u2018And if I had not sewn the boat together\nagain,\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018you would all have been drowned, therefore she\nis mine.\u2019 Then the king put in a word, and said, \u2018Each of you is right;\nand as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of\nyou to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great\ndeal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a\nreward for his skill, half a kingdom.\u2019 So the brothers agreed that this\nplan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who\nhad no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,\nas he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and\ntook good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the\nyoung lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have\nher again.", "Lily and the Lion": "A merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a\njourney; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should\nbring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels;\nbut the third, who was called Lily, said, \u2018Dear father, bring me a\nrose.\u2019 Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle\nof winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of\nflowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all\nthree, and bid them goodbye.\n\nAnd when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and\njewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the\nrose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the\npeople laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in\nsnow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as\nhe was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a\nfine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it\nseemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the\nfinest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked\ndreary and buried in the snow. \u2018A lucky hit!\u2019 said he, as he called to\nhis servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was\nthere, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.\n\nThis done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce\nlion, and roared out, \u2018Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up\nalive!\u2019 Then the man said, \u2018I knew not that the garden belonged to you;\ncan nothing save my life?\u2019 \u2018No!\u2019 said the lion, \u2018nothing, unless you\nundertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you\nagree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your\ndaughter.\u2019 But the man was unwilling to do so and said, \u2018It may be my\nyoungest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when\nI go home.\u2019 Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, \u2018It may\nperhaps be only a cat or a dog.\u2019 And at last the man yielded with a\nheavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever\nshould meet him first on his return.\n\nAnd as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest\ndaughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed\nhim home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was\nstill more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep,\nsaying, \u2018Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high\nprice, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has\nyou, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.\u2019 Then he told her all that\nhad happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen.\n\nBut she comforted him, and said, \u2018Dear father, the word you have given\nmust be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let\nme come safe home again.\u2019\n\nThe next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her\nfather, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was\nan enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the\nevening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the\ncastle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The\nwedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The\nprince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his\ncourt; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself,\nshe knew not whither, till the night came again.\n\nAfter some time he said to her, \u2018Tomorrow there will be a great feast in\nyour father\u2019s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if\nyou wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.\u2019 Then she\nrejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set\nout with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had\nthought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and\nstayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.\n\nHer second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to\ngo to the wedding, she said to the prince, \u2018I will not go alone this\ntime--you must go with me.\u2019 But he would not, and said that it would be\na very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should\nfall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be\nchanged into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven\nlong years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care\nno light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and\ntook with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick\nwalls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but,\nunluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the\nwedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church,\nand passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light\nfell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came\nin and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her,\n\u2018Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but\nevery now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you\nthe way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me\nfree.\u2019\n\nThis said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every\nnow and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to\njourney. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked\nneither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven\nyears. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time\nwas fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still\nfar off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white\nfeather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.\n\u2018Now,\u2019 thought she to herself, \u2018no aid of man can be of use to me.\u2019 So\nshe went to the sun and said, \u2018Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill\u2019s\ntop and the valley\u2019s depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said the sun, \u2018I have not seen it; but I will give thee a\ncasket--open it when thy hour of need comes.\u2019\n\nSo she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when\nthe moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, \u2018Thou shinest through the\nnight, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said the moon, \u2018I cannot help thee but I will give thee an\negg--break it when need comes.\u2019\n\nThen she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she\nraised up her voice to it, and said, \u2018Thou blowest through every tree\nand under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the\nnight-wind, \u2018but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen\nit.\u2019 Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had\nnot seen it, but the south wind said, \u2018I have seen the white dove--he\nhas fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the\nseven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon;\nand the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from\nyou.\u2019 Then the night-wind said, \u2018I will give thee counsel. Go to the\nRed Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count them, and when thou\ncomest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and\nso the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you\nin their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged\nlike bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved\none as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to\nyour home. I will also give thee this nut,\u2019 continued the night-wind.\n\u2018When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will\nimmediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able\nto rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole\nway; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let\nyou both fall into the sea.\u2019\n\nSo our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had\nsaid; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the\nlion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But\nno sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized\nthe prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin\u2019s back, and went off\ncarrying the prince away with her.\n\nThus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she\ntook heart and said, \u2018As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock\ncrows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.\u2019 She went on for\na long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the\nprincess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and\nshe heard that the wedding was about to be held. \u2018Heaven aid me now!\u2019\nsaid she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found\nthat within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it\non, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and\nthe dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be\nsold. \u2018Not for gold and silver.\u2019 said she, \u2018but for flesh and blood.\u2019\nThe princess asked what she meant, and she said, \u2018Let me speak with the\nbridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.\u2019\nAt last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the\nprince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When\nevening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into\nhis chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: \u2018I have\nfollowed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the\nnight-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome\nthe dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?\u2019 But the prince all the time\nslept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like\nthe whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.\n\nThen poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and\nwhen she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow,\nand sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of\nthe egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran\nout a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then\nnestled under the old one\u2019s wings, so as to form the most beautiful\nsight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the\nbride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth\nand asked her if she would sell the brood. \u2018Not for gold or silver, but\nfor flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom\nin his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.\u2019\n\nThen the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to\nwhat she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked\nthe chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the\nchamberlain told him all--how he had given him a sleeping draught, and\nhow a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was\nto come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the\nsleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what\nwoes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been,\nhe knew his beloved wife\u2019s voice, and sprang up, and said, \u2018You have\nawakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell\naround me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent\nyou to me in a lucky hour.\u2019\n\nAnd they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated\nthemselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea.\nWhen they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water,\nand immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin\nrested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found\ntheir child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their\ntroubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.", "The Fox and the Horse": "A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to\nhim: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him\nnothing more to eat, and said, \u2018I want you no longer, so take yourself\noff out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are\nstronger than a lion.\u2019 Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.\n\nThe poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the\nwood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently\na fox met him: \u2018What\u2019s the matter, my friend?\u2019 said he, \u2018why do you hang\ndown your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 replied the\nhorse, \u2018justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has\nforgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I\ncan no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become\nstronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I\nhave of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.\u2019\n\nHowever, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, \u2018I will help you;\nlie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be\ndead.\u2019 The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the\nlion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, \u2018A little way off\nlies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of\nhis carcase.\u2019 The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and\nwhen they came to the horse, the fox said, \u2018You will not be able to eat\nhim comfortably here; I\u2019ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to\nhis tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your\nleisure.\u2019\n\nThis advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the\nfox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs\ntogether and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he\ncould not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the\nhorse on the shoulder, and said, \u2018Jip! Dobbin! Jip!\u2019 Then up he sprang,\nand moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar\nand bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the\nhorse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his\nmaster\u2019s house.\n\n\u2018Here he is, master,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have got the better of him\u2019: and when\nthe farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. \u2018Thou\nshalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.\u2019 And so the poor old\nhorse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.", "The Blue Light": "There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the\nking faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer\nbecause of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him:\n\u2018You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not\nreceive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me\nservice for them.\u2019 Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living,\nwent away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the\nevening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light,\nwhich he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. \u2018Do give\nme one night\u2019s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,\u2019 said he to\nher, \u2018or I shall starve.\u2019 \u2018Oho!\u2019 she answered, \u2018who gives anything to a\nrun-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you\nwill do what I wish.\u2019 \u2018What do you wish?\u2019 said the soldier. \u2018That you\nshould dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.\u2019 The soldier consented,\nand next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by\nthe evening. \u2018I see well enough,\u2019 said the witch, \u2018that you can do no\nmore today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for\nwhich you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.\u2019 The\nsoldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch\nproposed that he should stay one night more. \u2018Tomorrow, you shall only\ndo me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old\ndry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes\nout, and you shall bring it up again.\u2019 Next day the old woman took him\nto the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and\nmade her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he\ncame near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the\nblue light away from him. \u2018No,\u2019 said he, perceiving her evil intention,\n\u2018I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon\nthe ground.\u2019 The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the\nwell, and went away.\n\nThe poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue\nlight went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well\nthat he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully,\nthen suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which\nwas still half full. \u2018This shall be my last pleasure,\u2019 thought he,\npulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the\nsmoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood\nbefore him, and said: \u2018Lord, what are your commands?\u2019 \u2018What my commands\nare?\u2019 replied the soldier, quite astonished. \u2018I must do everything you\nbid me,\u2019 said the little man. \u2018Good,\u2019 said the soldier; \u2018then in the\nfirst place help me out of this well.\u2019 The little man took him by the\nhand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget\nto take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the\ntreasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the\nsoldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said\nto the little man: \u2018Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before\nthe judge.\u2019 In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild\ntom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man\nreappeared. \u2018It is all done,\u2019 said he, \u2018and the witch is already hanging\non the gallows. What further commands has my lord?\u2019 inquired the dwarf.\n\u2018At this moment, none,\u2019 answered the soldier; \u2018you can return home, only\nbe at hand immediately, if I summon you.\u2019 \u2018Nothing more is needed than\nthat you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear\nbefore you at once.\u2019 Thereupon he vanished from his sight.\n\nThe soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the\nbest inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord\nfurnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the\nsoldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin\nand said: \u2018I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me,\nand left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.\u2019 \u2018What am I to\ndo?\u2019 asked the little man. \u2018Late at night, when the king\u2019s daughter is\nin bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant\u2019s work for\nme.\u2019 The manikin said: \u2018That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very\ndangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.\u2019\nWhen twelve o\u2019clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin\ncarried in the princess. \u2018Aha! are you there?\u2019 cried the soldier, \u2018get\nto your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.\u2019 When\nshe had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he\nstretched out his feet and said: \u2018Pull off my boots,\u2019 and then he\nthrew them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean\nand brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without\nopposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock\ncrowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her\nin her bed.\n\nNext morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told\nhim that she had had a very strange dream. \u2018I was carried through the\nstreets with the rapidity of lightning,\u2019 said she, \u2018and taken into a\nsoldier\u2019s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his\nroom, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a\ndream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.\u2019\n\u2018The dream may have been true,\u2019 said the king. \u2018I will give you a piece\nof advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the\npocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and\nleave a track in the streets.\u2019 But unseen by the king, the manikin was\nstanding beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when\nthe sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas\ncertainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the\ncrafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there\nwas. And again the princess was compelled to do servant\u2019s work until\ncock-crow.\n\nNext morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was\nall in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up\npeas, and saying: \u2018It must have rained peas, last night.\u2019 \u2018We must think\nof something else,\u2019 said the king; \u2018keep your shoes on when you go to\nbed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide\none of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.\u2019 The black manikin\nheard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to\nbring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no\nexpedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found\nin the soldier\u2019s house it would go badly with him. \u2018Do what I bid you,\u2019\nreplied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged\nto work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under\nthe bed.\n\nNext morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter\u2019s\nshoe. It was found at the soldier\u2019s, and the soldier himself, who at the\nentreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back,\nand thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable\nthings he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in\nhis pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of\nhis dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The\nsoldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to\nhim: \u2018Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in\nthe inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.\u2019 His comrade ran\nthither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone\nagain, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. \u2018Have no\nfear,\u2019 said the latter to his master. \u2018Go wheresoever they take you, and\nlet them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.\u2019 Next day\nthe soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge\ncondemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last\nfavour of the king. \u2018What is it?\u2019 asked the king. \u2018That I may smoke one\nmore pipe on my way.\u2019 \u2018You may smoke three,\u2019 answered the king, \u2018but do\nnot imagine that I will spare your life.\u2019 Then the soldier pulled out\nhis pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths\nof smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his\nhand, and said: \u2018What does my lord command?\u2019 \u2018Strike down to earth that\nfalse judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has\ntreated me so ill.\u2019 Then the manikin fell on them like lightning,\ndarting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by\nhis cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king\nwas terrified; he threw himself on the soldier\u2019s mercy, and merely to\nbe allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his\ndaughter to wife.", "The Raven": "There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run\nalone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not\nquiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens\nflying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: \u2018I wish you\nwere a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.\u2019\nScarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was\nturned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The\nbird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time,\nand meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.\n\nLong after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard\na raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew\nnear, the raven said, \u2018I am by birth a king\u2019s daughter, but am now under\nthe spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.\u2019 \u2018What\nam I to do?\u2019 he asked. She replied, \u2018Go farther into the wood until you\ncome to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and\ndrink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into\na deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the\nhouse is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.\nI shall drive there in my carriage at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon for\nthree successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the\nsecond by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you\nfail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.\u2019\n\nThe man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, \u2018Alas! I\nknow even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable\nto save me.\u2019 The man assured her again that he would on no account touch\na thing to eat or drink.\n\nWhen he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and\nsaid, \u2018Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you\nsomething to eat and drink.\u2019\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 answered the man, \u2018I will neither eat not drink.\u2019\n\nBut she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, \u2018If you will\nnot eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink\ncounts for nothing,\u2019 and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and\ndrank.\n\nAs it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden\nand mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of\nfatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little\nwhile, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute\nhis eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep,\nthat all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two\no\u2019clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;\nbut even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, \u2018I\nknow he has fallen asleep.\u2019 When she entered the garden, there she found\nhim as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out\nof her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it\nwas all in vain, he still continued sleeping.\n\nThe next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and\ndrink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent\nentreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank\nagain.\n\nTowards two o\u2019clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to\nwatch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel\nso tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could\nnot stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.\nAs the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully\nto herself, \u2018I know he has fallen asleep.\u2019 She went as before to look\nfor him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.\n\nThe following day the old woman said to him, \u2018What is this? You are not\neating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?\u2019\n\nHe answered, \u2018I may not and will not either eat or drink.\u2019\n\nBut she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,\nand when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and\ntook a deep draught.\n\nWhen the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in\nthe garden to await the king\u2019s daughter, but he felt even more overcome\nwith weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down,\nhe slept like a log. At two o\u2019clock the raven could be seen approaching,\nand this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her\nhorses, were black.\n\nShe was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, \u2018I\nknow he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.\u2019 She\nfound him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no\navail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask\nof wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would\nnever grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was\nengraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid\na letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food\nand drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words:\n\u2018I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me\nfree; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle\nof Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.\u2019 She then\nreturned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.\n\nWhen the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved\nat heart, and said, \u2018She has no doubt been here and driven away again,\nand it is now too late for me to save her.\u2019 Then his eyes fell on the\nthings which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it\nall that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his\nway and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which\ndirection he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it\nand came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for\nfourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night\ncame on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again\nthe next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,\nthinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a\nhowling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till\nit was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then\nseeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.\n\nHe found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than\nit really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense\ngiant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, \u2018If the giant\nsees me going in, my life will not be worth much.\u2019 However, after a\nwhile he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,\nhe called out, \u2018It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had\nanything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.\u2019 \u2018I\nwould rather you let that alone,\u2019 said the man, \u2018for I do not willingly\ngive myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to\nsatisfy your hunger.\u2019 \u2018If that is so,\u2019 replied the giant, \u2018I will leave\nyou in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.\u2019\n\nSo they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the\nbread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,\nwere still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and\nate and drank to his heart\u2019s content. When he had finished his supper\nthe man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.\nThe giant said, \u2018I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,\nvillages, and houses.\u2019 So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,\nbut could not find it. \u2018Never mind,\u2019 he said, \u2018I have larger maps\nupstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,\u2019 but they searched in\nvain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought\nhe should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to\nremain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was\naway in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him\nabout the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own\nmaps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when\nhe had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and\nlooked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he\nfetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until\nat last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. \u2018How shall I\nbe able to get there?\u2019 asked the man. \u2018I have two hours to spare,\u2019 said\nthe giant, \u2018and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I\nmust then return to look after the child who is in our care.\u2019\n\nThe giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues\nof the castle, where he left him, saying, \u2018You will be able to walk the\nremainder of the way yourself.\u2019 The man journeyed on day and night\ntill he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,\nhowever, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the\nenchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was\noverjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but\nthe sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he\nfell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was\ngreatly grieved, and said to himself, \u2018I will remain here and wait for\nher,\u2019 so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for\na whole year, and every day he saw the king\u2019s daughter driving round her\ncastle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.\n\nLooking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he\ncalled out to them, \u2018God be with you.\u2019 They stopped when they heard the\ncall, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their\nfighting, which now became more furious. \u2018God be with you,\u2019 he cried\nagain, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went\nback to their fighting. A third time he called out, \u2018God be with you,\u2019\nand then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between\nthe three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so\nangrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,\nand that he had but to strike it against any door through which he\nwished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he\nhad found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had\ncaught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even\nup the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they\nwould keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would\nseparate. On hearing this, the man said, \u2018I will give you something in\nexchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,\nbut something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove\nwhether all you have told me about your three things is true.\u2019 The\nrobbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick\nand the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer\nvisible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after\nanother, crying, \u2018There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you\ndeserve; are you satisfied now!\u2019\n\nAfter this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of\nthe castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,\nand it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the\nsteps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden\ngoblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still\nwore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger,\nand threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.\n\u2018That is my own ring,\u2019 she exclaimed, \u2018and if that is so the man must\nalso be here who is coming to set me free.\u2019\n\nShe sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.\nMeanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off\nthe cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and\ncried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and\nshe kissed him, and said, \u2018Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow\nwe will celebrate our marriage.\u2019", "The Golden Goose": "There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called\nDummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.\n\nIt happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,\nand before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a\nbottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.\n\nWhen he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade\nhim good day, and said: \u2018Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,\nand let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.\u2019 But\nthe clever son answered: \u2018If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have\nnone for myself; be off with you,\u2019 and he left the little man standing\nand went on.\n\nBut when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a\nfalse stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home\nand have it bound up. And this was the little grey man\u2019s doing.\n\nAfter this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,\nlike the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man\nmet him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.\nBut the second son, too, said sensibly enough: \u2018What I give you will be\ntaken away from myself; be off!\u2019 and he left the little man standing and\nwent on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a\nfew blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be\ncarried home.\n\nThen Dummling said: \u2018Father, do let me go and cut wood.\u2019 The father\nanswered: \u2018Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,\nyou do not understand anything about it.\u2019 But Dummling begged so long\nthat at last he said: \u2018Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting\nyourself.\u2019 His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the\ncinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.\n\nWhen he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,\nand greeting him, said: \u2018Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out\nof your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.\u2019 Dummling answered: \u2018I have\nonly cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit\ndown and eat.\u2019 So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his\ncinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good\nwine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: \u2018Since\nyou have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will\ngive you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will\nfind something at the roots.\u2019 Then the little man took leave of him.\n\nDummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose\nsitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and\ntaking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the\nnight. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were\ncurious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have\nliked to have one of its golden feathers.\n\nThe eldest thought: \u2018I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a\nfeather,\u2019 and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by\nthe wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.\n\nThe second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a\nfeather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she\nwas held fast.\n\nAt last the third also came with the like intent, and the others\nscreamed out: \u2018Keep away; for goodness\u2019 sake keep away!\u2019 But she did\nnot understand why she was to keep away. \u2018The others are there,\u2019 she\nthought, \u2018I may as well be there too,\u2019 and ran to them; but as soon as\nshe had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they\nhad to spend the night with the goose.\n\nThe next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,\nwithout troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to\nit. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,\nwherever his legs took him.\n\nIn the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the\nprocession he said: \u2018For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you\nrunning across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?\u2019 At the\nsame time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,\nbut as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself\nobliged to run behind.\n\nBefore long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running\nbehind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: \u2018Hi!\nyour reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a\nchristening today!\u2019 and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but\nwas also held fast to it.\n\nWhilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers\ncame with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them\nand begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had\nscarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were\nseven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.\n\nSoon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter\nwho was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth\na decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry\nher. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train\nbefore the king\u2019s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people\nrunning on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite\nloudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have\nher for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all\nmanner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink\na cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could\ncertainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place\nwhere he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very\nsorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so\nsorely, and he answered: \u2018I have such a great thirst and cannot quench\nit; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but\nthat to me is like a drop on a hot stone!\u2019\n\n\u2018There, I can help you,\u2019 said Dummling, \u2018just come with me and you shall\nbe satisfied.\u2019\n\nHe led him into the king\u2019s cellar, and the man bent over the huge\nbarrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was\nout he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more\nfor his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom\neveryone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a\nnew condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain\nof bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the\nforest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his\nbody with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: \u2018I have eaten a\nwhole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger\nas I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to\ndie of hunger.\u2019\n\nAt this Dummling was glad, and said: \u2018Get up and come with me; you shall\neat yourself full.\u2019 He led him to the king\u2019s palace where all the\nflour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge\nmountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,\nbegan to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.\nThen Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again\nsought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on\nwater. \u2018As soon as you come sailing back in it,\u2019 said he, \u2018you shall\nhave my daughter for wife.\u2019\n\nDummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey\nman to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,\nhe said: \u2018Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you\nthe ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.\u2019 Then he\ngave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king\nsaw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The\nwedding was celebrated, and after the king\u2019s death, Dummling inherited\nhis kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.\n\n     [*] Simpleton", "The Water of Life": "Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way\noff, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill\nthat nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved\nat their father\u2019s sickness; and as they were walking together very\nmournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and\nasked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill,\nand that they were afraid nothing could save him. \u2018I know what would,\u2019\nsaid the little old man; \u2018it is the Water of Life. If he could have a\ndraught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.\u2019 Then\nthe eldest son said, \u2018I will soon find it\u2019: and he went to the sick\nking, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as\nit was the only thing that could save him. \u2018No,\u2019 said the king. \u2018I had\nrather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in\nyour journey.\u2019 But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the\nprince thought to himself, \u2018If I bring my father this water, he will\nmake me sole heir to his kingdom.\u2019\n\nThen he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a\ndeep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he\nsaw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a\nsugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,\n\u2018Prince, whither so fast?\u2019 \u2018What is that to thee, you ugly imp?\u2019 said\nthe prince haughtily, and rode on.\n\nBut the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell\nof ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became\nnarrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he\ncould not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his\nhorse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing\nround him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was\nshut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way\non foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself\nunable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.\n\nMeantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son\u2019s\nreturn, till at last the second son said, \u2018Father, I will go in search\nof the Water of Life.\u2019 For he thought to himself, \u2018My brother is surely\ndead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.\u2019 The king was\nat first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.\nSo he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done,\nand met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the\nmountains, saying, as before, \u2018Prince, prince, whither so fast?\u2019 \u2018Mind\nyour own affairs, busybody!\u2019 said the prince scornfully, and rode on.\n\nBut the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder\nbrother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the\nheart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think\nthemselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.\n\nWhen the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son\nsaid he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should\nsoon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf\nmet him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and\nsaid, \u2018Prince, whither so fast?\u2019 And the prince said, \u2018I am going in\nsearch of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die:\ncan you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!\u2019 \u2018Do you know\nwhere it is to be found?\u2019 asked the dwarf. \u2018No,\u2019 said the prince, \u2018I do\nnot. Pray tell me if you know.\u2019 \u2018Then as you have spoken to me kindly,\nand are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to\ngo. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and,\nthat you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand\nand two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three\ntimes with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying\ndown inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they\nwill let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the\nWater of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer\nthe door will shut upon you for ever.\u2019\n\nThen the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his\nfriendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on\nand on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey\u2019s end, and\nfound everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at\nthe third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on\nthrough the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he\nsaw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings\nand put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a\nsword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a\nroom where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him\njoyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound\nher, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and\nmarry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life\nwas in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he\nwanted before the clock struck twelve.\n\nHe walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a\ndelightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,\nas he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on\nthe lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep\nfell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was\nstriking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully\nfrightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full\nof water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of\nthe iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him\nthat it snapped off a piece of his heel.\n\nWhen he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got\nthe Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed\nby the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, \u2018You\nhave made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole\narmies, and the bread will never fail you.\u2019 Then the prince thought\nto himself, \u2018I cannot go home to my father without my brothers\u2019; so he\nsaid, \u2018My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who\nset out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?\u2019\n\u2018I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,\u2019 said the dwarf,\n\u2018because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.\u2019\nThe prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set\nthem free, though unwillingly, saying, \u2018Beware of them, for they have\nbad hearts.\u2019 Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them,\nand told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water\nof Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful\nprincess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to\nwait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.\n\nThen they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a\ncountry that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was\nfeared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land\nthe bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the\nwonderful sword, and he slew the enemy\u2019s army with it; and thus the\nkingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he\nbefriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.\n\nWhen they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage\nthe two eldest said to themselves, \u2018Our brother has got the water which\nwe could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the\nkingdom, which is our right\u2019; so they were full of envy and revenge, and\nagreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was\nfast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it\nfor themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.\n\nWhen they came to their journey\u2019s end, the youngest son brought his cup\nto the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however,\nhad he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was\nbefore; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest\nfor what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father,\nbut that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.\nHe no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his\nsickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.\nThen they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, \u2018Well,\nbrother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble\nand we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did\nnot you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take\naway your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better\nsay nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you\nsay; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain:\nbut be quiet, and we will let you off.\u2019\n\nThe old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought\nthat he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court\ntogether, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to\nbe put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one\nday, when the king\u2019s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they\nwere alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that\nthe prince said, \u2018My friend, what is the matter with you?\u2019 \u2018I cannot and\ndare not tell you,\u2019 said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said,\n\u2018Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will\nforgive you.\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the huntsman; \u2018the king has ordered me to\nshoot you.\u2019 The prince started at this, and said, \u2018Let me live, and I\nwill change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my\nfather, and do you give me your shabby one.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said\nthe huntsman; \u2018I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not\nhave shot you.\u2019 Then he took the prince\u2019s coat, and gave him the shabby\none, and went away through the wood.\n\nSome time after, three grand embassies came to the old king\u2019s court,\nwith rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now\nall these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword\nand loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their\npeople. This touched the old king\u2019s heart, and he thought his son might\nstill be guiltless, and said to his court, \u2018O that my son were still\nalive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!\u2019 \u2018He is still alive,\u2019\nsaid the huntsman; \u2018and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him\ngo in peace, and brought home his royal coat.\u2019 At this the king was\noverwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that\nif his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.\n\nMeanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should\ncome back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining\ngold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode\nstraight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must\nlet him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was\nnot the right one; and that they must send him away at once.\n\nThe time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make\nhaste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set\nher free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with\nher. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to\nlook at it, and he thought to himself, \u2018It is a pity to ride upon this\nbeautiful road\u2019; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of\nit. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road\nhe took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go\nabout his business.\n\nThe second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when\nhe came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it,\nhe stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to\nhimself, \u2018What a pity it is that anything should tread here!\u2019 Then he\ntoo turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to\nthe gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too\nmust go away about his business; and away he went.\n\nNow when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest\nin which he had lain hid for fear of his father\u2019s anger, and set out in\nsearch of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all\nthe way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was\nmade of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the\ngate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said\nhe was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the\nkingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told\nhim she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to\nhave him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went\nto visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything;\nhow his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne\nall those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very\nangry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape,\nand got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they\nwent to nobody knew and nobody cared.\n\nAnd now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his\nkingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.\nAnd young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once\non the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the\nsugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.\n\n  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.\n  And all the good people they danced and they sung,\n  And feasted and frolick\u2019d I can\u2019t tell how long.", "The Twelve Huntsmen": "There was once a king\u2019s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And\nwhen he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father\nlay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.\nThen he said to his beloved: \u2018I must now go and leave you, I give you\na ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch\nyou.\u2019 So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was\ndangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: \u2018Dear son, I wished\nto see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,\u2019 and\nhe named a certain king\u2019s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was\nin such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: \u2018Yes,\ndear father, your will shall be done,\u2019 and thereupon the king shut his\neyes, and died.\n\nWhen therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of\nmourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given\nhis father, and caused the king\u2019s daughter to be asked in marriage, and\nshe was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted\nso much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father\nsaid to her: \u2018Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have\nwhatsoever you will.\u2019 She thought for a moment and said: \u2018Dear father,\nI wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.\u2019\nThe father said: \u2018If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,\u2019\nand he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven\nyoung maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face,\nfigure, and size.\n\nWhen they came to the king\u2019s daughter, she had twelve suits of\nhuntsmen\u2019s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put\non the huntsmen\u2019s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.\nThereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them,\nand rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.\nThen she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of\nthem into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but\nas they were such handsome fellows, he said: \u2018Yes,\u2019 and that he would\nwillingly take them, and now they were the king\u2019s twelve huntsmen.\n\nThe king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew\nall concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he\nsaid to the king: \u2018You think you have twelve huntsmen?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the\nking, \u2018they are twelve huntsmen.\u2019 The lion continued: \u2018You are mistaken,\nthey are twelve girls.\u2019 The king said: \u2018That cannot be true! How\nwill you prove that to me?\u2019 \u2018Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the\nante-chamber,\u2019 answered the lion, \u2018and then you will soon see. Men have\na firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls\ntrip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.\u2019 The king\nwas well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.\n\nThere was, however, a servant of the king\u2019s who favoured the huntsmen,\nand when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to\nthem and repeated everything, and said: \u2018The lion wants to make the king\nbelieve that you are girls.\u2019 Then the king\u2019s daughter thanked him, and\nsaid to her maidens: \u2018Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.\u2019\nSo next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before\nhim, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they\nstepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not\none of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again,\nand the king said to the lion: \u2018You have lied to me, they walk just like\nmen.\u2019 The lion said: \u2018They have been informed that they were going to\nbe put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve\nspinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to\nthem and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.\u2019\nThe king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the\nante-chamber.\n\nBut the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,\nand disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king\u2019s daughter\nsaid to her eleven girls: \u2018Show some constraint, and do not look round\nat the spinning-wheels.\u2019 And next morning when the king had his twelve\nhuntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once\nlooked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion:\n\u2018You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the\nspinning-wheels.\u2019 The lion replied: \u2018They have restrained themselves.\u2019\nThe king, however, would no longer believe the lion.\n\nThe twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his\nliking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that\nonce when they were out hunting, news came that the king\u2019s bride was\napproaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that\nher heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The\nking thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him,\nwanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which\nhe had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he\nrecognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and\nwhen she opened her eyes he said: \u2018You are mine, and I am yours, and\nno one in the world can alter that.\u2019 He sent a messenger to the other\nbride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife\nalready, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new\none. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken\ninto favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.", "The King of the Golden Mountain": "There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very\nyoung, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then\nmaking a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth,\nin the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were\nlost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that\nnothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often\nwent in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of\nhis trouble.\n\nOne day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no\ngreat comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like\nto be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking,\nblack dwarf. \u2018Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?\u2019 said he to the\nmerchant; \u2018what is it you take so deeply to heart?\u2019 \u2018If you would do me\nany good I would willingly tell you,\u2019 said the merchant. \u2018Who knows but\nI may?\u2019 said the little man: \u2018tell me what ails you, and perhaps you\nwill find I may be of some use.\u2019 Then the merchant told him how all his\nwealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left\nbut that little plot of land. \u2018Oh, trouble not yourself about that,\u2019\nsaid the dwarf; \u2018only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence,\nwhatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much\nas you please.\u2019 The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask;\nthat it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that\nsort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and\nsigned and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.\n\nBut as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he\ncrept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in\nhis face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and\nhorror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no\ngold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke\nthat the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money\ncame, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.\n\nAbout a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look\nfor some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and\nthere, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the\nfloor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about\nhis son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than\nbefore.\n\nMeantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew\nnear the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad\nand thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The\nboy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for\nsome time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it,\nsold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the\ntwelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel\nsaid, \u2018Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be\ntoo much for the little man.\u2019\n\nWhen the time came, the father and son went out together to the place\nagreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself\nand his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came,\nand walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way\nto get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At\nlast the boy said to him. \u2018Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or\nwhat do you want?\u2019 Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that\nwas fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what\ngood luck was in store for him. \u2018Have you brought me what you said you\nwould?\u2019 said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but\nHeinel said again, \u2018What do you want here?\u2019 The dwarf said, \u2018I come to\ntalk with your father, not with you.\u2019 \u2018You have cheated and taken in my\nfather,\u2019 said the son; \u2018pray give him up his bond at once.\u2019 \u2018Fair and\nsoftly,\u2019 said the little old man; \u2018right is right; I have paid my money,\nand your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me\nhave what I paid it for.\u2019 \u2018You must have my consent to that first,\u2019 said\nHeinel, \u2018so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.\u2019 The old\nman grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad\nto get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk,\nthey came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and\nthat so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the\nfairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed\nhis own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed\nfriend, who seemed so anxious for his company.\n\nSo, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that\nHeinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard\nby; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he\nshould thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and\nweather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat,\nbut before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side\nlow in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and\nwent home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at\nany rate he had had his revenge.\n\nThe boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her\nfriend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The\nyoung man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown\nland. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle\nbut empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. \u2018Here,\u2019 said he to\nhimself, \u2018must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.\u2019 So he once\nmore searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white\nsnake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.\n\nNow the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad\nto see him, and said, \u2018Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve\nlong years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she\npromised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come:\ntheir faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.\nThey will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do\nwhat they will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you--bear all; only\nspeak not a word, and at twelve o\u2019clock they must go away. The second\nnight twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who\nwill even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their\npower is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the\nWater of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life\nand health.\u2019 And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and\nspoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his\nneck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle,\nthe wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden\nMountain.\n\nThey lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus\neight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his\nfather; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was\nagainst his going, and said, \u2018I know well that misfortunes will come\nupon us if you go.\u2019 However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his\ngoing away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, \u2018Take this ring, and\nput it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise\nnever to make use of it to bring me hence to your father\u2019s house.\u2019 Then\nhe said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and\nwished himself near the town where his father lived.\n\nHeinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would\nnot let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a\nneighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock,\nand thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father\u2019s\nhouse, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him,\nand said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long\nsince dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would\nnot even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that\nhe was his son, and said, \u2018Is there no mark by which you would know me\nif I am really your son?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said his mother, \u2018our Heinel had a mark\nlike a raspberry on his right arm.\u2019 Then he showed them the mark, and\nthey knew that what he had said was true.\n\nHe next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was\nmarried to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant\nsaid, \u2018that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels\nabout in a shepherd\u2019s frock!\u2019 At this the son was vexed; and forgetting\nhis word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an\ninstant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had\nbroken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to\nsoothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in\ntruth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.\n\nOne day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her\nthe spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat\nhimself down, and said, \u2018I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my\nhead in your lap, and sleep a while.\u2019 As soon as he had fallen asleep,\nhowever, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and\nwished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke\nhe found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.\n\u2018I can never go back to my father\u2019s house,\u2019 said he; \u2018they would say I\nam a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to\nmy kingdom.\u2019\n\nSo saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three\ngiants were sharing their father\u2019s goods; and as they saw him pass they\ncried out and said, \u2018Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods\nbetween us.\u2019 Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy\u2019s head whenever\nthe wearer gave the words, \u2018Heads off!\u2019; a cloak that made the owner\ninvisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that\ncarried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let\nhim try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value\nupon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly,\nand in a moment he was a fly. \u2018The cloak is very well,\u2019 said he: \u2018now\ngive me the sword.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said they; \u2018not unless you undertake not to\nsay, \u201cHeads off!\u201d for if you do we are all dead men.\u2019 So they gave it\nhim, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also;\nand the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at\nthe Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left\nbehind with no goods to share or quarrel about.\n\nAs Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and\nthe people around told him that his queen was about to marry another\nhusband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the\ncastle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one\nsaw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it\naway and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he\ntook it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and\ndrink, her plate and cup were always empty.\n\nUpon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber\nalone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said\nshe to herself, \u2018was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment\nstill seem to bind me?\u2019\n\n\u2018False and fickle one!\u2019 said he. \u2018One indeed came who set thee free, and\nhe is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to\nhave had such treatment from thee?\u2019 Then he went out and sent away the\ncompany, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back\nto the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.\nHowever, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them\nif they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried\nto seize him; but he drew his sword. \u2018Heads Off!\u2019 cried he; and with the\nword the traitors\u2019 heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king\nof the Golden Mountain.", "Doctor Knowall": "There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with\ntwo oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two\ntalers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that\nthe doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he\nate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly\nhave been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length\ninquired if he too could not be a doctor. \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said the doctor,\n\u2018that is soon managed.\u2019 \u2018What must I do?\u2019 asked the peasant. \u2018In the\nfirst place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on\nthe frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into\nmoney, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to\nmedicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: \u201cI\nam Doctor Knowall,\u201d and have that nailed up above your house-door.\u2019 The\npeasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored\npeople awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money\nstolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such\na village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had\nthe horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and\nasked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was\nto go with him and bring back the stolen money. \u2018Oh, yes, but Grete, my\nwife, must go too.\u2019 The lord was willing, and let both of them have a\nseat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came\nto the nobleman\u2019s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to\nsit down and eat. \u2018Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,\u2019 said he, and he seated\nhimself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a\ndish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: \u2018Grete,\nthat was the first,\u2019 meaning that was the servant who brought the first\ndish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: \u2018That is\nthe first thief,\u2019 and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said\nto his comrade outside: \u2018The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he\nsaid I was the first.\u2019 The second did not want to go in at all, but was\nforced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,\nand said: \u2018Grete, that is the second.\u2019 This servant was equally alarmed,\nand he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the\npeasant again said: \u2018Grete, that is the third.\u2019 The fourth had to carry\nin a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to\nshow his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there\nwere crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and\ncried: \u2018Ah, poor Crabb.\u2019 When the lord heard that, he cried: \u2018There! he\nknows it; he must also know who has the money!\u2019\n\nOn this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the\ndoctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore\nhe went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen\nthe money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a\nheavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he\ndid they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was\nconcealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,\nsat down to the table, and said: \u2018My lord, now will I search in my book\nwhere the gold is hidden.\u2019 The fifth servant, however, crept into the\nstove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still\nand opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and\nlooked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: \u2018I\nknow you are there, so you had better come out!\u2019 Then the fellow in the\nstove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,\ncrying: \u2018That man knows everything!\u2019 Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord\nwhere the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received\nfrom both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.", "The Seven Ravens": "There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.\nAlthough the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that\nthey thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be\nchristened.\n\nSo the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some\nwater, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at\ndrawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their\npitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at\none another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the\nmeantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the\nyoung men stay so long. \u2018Surely,\u2019 said he, \u2018the whole seven must have\nforgotten themselves over some game of play\u2019; and when he had waited\nstill longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished\nthem all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he\nheard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as\nblack as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish\nso fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and\ncomforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons\nwith his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day\nmore beautiful.\n\nFor a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for\nher father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one\nday by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said\nthey, \u2018she is beautiful indeed, but still \u2018tis a pity that her brothers\nshould have been lost for her sake.\u2019 Then she was much grieved, and went\nto her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what\nhad become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but\nsaid it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent\ncause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and\nthought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;\nand she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole\naway, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever\nthey might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.\n\nShe took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother\nhad given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little\npitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool\nto rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and\njourneyed till she came to the world\u2019s end; then she came to the sun,\nbut the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to\nthe moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, \u2018I smell flesh\nand blood this way!\u2019 so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the\nstars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat\nupon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a\nlittle piece of wood, and said, \u2018If you have not this little piece of\nwood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,\nand there your brothers live.\u2019 The little girl took the piece of wood,\nrolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the\nglass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little\npiece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and\nshe saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?\nShe wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the\nglass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her\npocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the\npiece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.\n\nAs she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, \u2018What are you\nseeking for?\u2019 \u2018I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,\u2019 answered she.\nThen the dwarf said, \u2018My masters are not at home; but if you will wait\ntill they come, pray step in.\u2019 Now the little dwarf was getting their\ndinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and\ntheir drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and\nout of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each\nlittle glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had\nbrought with her fall into the last glass.\n\nOn a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the\ndwarf said, \u2018Here come my masters.\u2019 When they came in, they wanted to\neat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said\none after the other,\n\n\u2018Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my\nlittle glass?\u2019\n\n \u2018Caw! Caw! well I ween\n  Mortal lips have this way been.\u2019\n\nWhen the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the\nring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s,\nand said, \u2018O that our little sister would but come! then we should be\nfree.\u2019 When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door\nall the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all\nthe ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each\nother, and went merrily home.", "The Wedding of Mrs Fox": "FIRST STORY\n\nThere was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that\nhis wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He\nstretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved\nas if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in,\nand her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it\nbecame known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.\nThe maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went\nand opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:\n\n \u2018What may you be about, Miss Cat?\n  Do you sleep or do you wake?\u2019\n\nShe answered:\n\n \u2018I am not sleeping, I am waking,\n  Would you know what I am making?\n  I am boiling warm beer with butter,\n  Will you be my guest for supper?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, thank you, miss,\u2019 said the fox, \u2018what is Mrs Fox doing?\u2019 The maid\nreplied:\n\n \u2018She is sitting in her room,\n  Moaning in her gloom,\n  Weeping her little eyes quite red,\n  Because old Mr Fox is dead.\u2019\n\n\u2018Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo\nher.\u2019 \u2018Certainly, young sir.\u2019\n\n  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,\n  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,\n \u2018Mistress Fox, are you inside?\u2019\n \u2018Oh, yes, my little cat,\u2019 she cried.\n \u2018A wooer he stands at the door out there.\u2019\n \u2018What does he look like, my dear?\u2019\n\n\u2018Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?\u2019 \u2018Oh, no,\u2019 answered\nthe cat, \u2018he has only one.\u2019 \u2018Then I will not have him.\u2019\n\nMiss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there\nwas another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs\nFox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After\nthis still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they\nwere all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like\nold Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:\n\n \u2018Now open the gates and doors all wide,\n  And carry old Mr Fox outside.\u2019\n\nBut just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred\nunder the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs\nFox out of the house.\n\n\nSECOND STORY\n\nWhen old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the\ndoor, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The\nwolf greeted her, and said:\n\n \u2018Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,\n  How comes it that alone you sit?\n  What are you making good?\u2019\n\nThe cat replied:\n\n \u2018In milk I\u2019m breaking bread so sweet,\n  Will you be my guest, and eat?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, thank you, Mrs Cat,\u2019 answered the wolf. \u2018Is Mrs Fox not at home?\u2019\n\nThe cat said:\n\n \u2018She sits upstairs in her room,\n  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,\n  Bewailing her trouble so sore,\n  For old Mr Fox is no more.\u2019\n\nThe wolf answered:\n\n \u2018If she\u2019s in want of a husband now,\n  Then will it please her to step below?\u2019\n  The cat runs quickly up the stair,\n  And lets her tail fly here and there,\n  Until she comes to the parlour door.\n  With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:\n \u2018Are you within, good Mistress Fox?\n  If you\u2019re in want of a husband now,\n  Then will it please you to step below?\n\nMrs Fox asked: \u2018Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed\nmouth?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered the cat. \u2018Then he won\u2019t do for me.\u2019\n\nWhen the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and\nall the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good\nqualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the\ncat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young\nfox. Then Mrs Fox said: \u2018Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a\nlittle pointed mouth?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the cat, \u2018he has.\u2019 \u2018Then let him come\nupstairs,\u2019 said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding\nfeast.\n\n \u2018Sweep me the room as clean as you can,\n  Up with the window, fling out my old man!\n  For many a fine fat mouse he brought,\n  Yet of his wife he never thought,\n  But ate up every one he caught.\u2019\n\nThen the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much\nrejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing\nstill.", "The Salad": "As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood,\nthere came up a little old woman, and said to him, \u2018Good day, good day;\nyou seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me\nsomething to eat.\u2019 The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in\nhis pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but\nshe took hold of him, and said, \u2018Listen, my friend, to what I am going\nto tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after\na little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds\nsitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down\ndead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when\nyou wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to\nbe. Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will\nfind a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It\nis the bird\u2019s heart that will bring you this good luck.\u2019\n\nThe huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, \u2018If all this does\nhappen, it will be a fine thing for me.\u2019 When he had gone a hundred\nsteps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him,\nand looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills\nand feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if\neach wished to have it himself. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the huntsman, \u2018this is\nwonderful; this happens just as the old woman said\u2019; then he shot into\nthe midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the\nflock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.\nThen the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took\nout the heart, and carried the cloak home with him.\n\nThe next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay\nthe piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and\nindeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold, and\nat last thought to himself, \u2018Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am\nat home? I will go out into the world and look about me.\u2019\n\nThen he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his\nneck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through\na thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow,\nand at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young\nlady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and\nsaid to the young lady, \u2018There is a young man coming out of the wood who\ncarries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child,\nfor it is more fit for us than for him. He has a bird\u2019s heart that\nbrings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.\u2019 Meantime the\nhuntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, \u2018I\nhave been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle\nand rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want\u2019;\nbut the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful\nlady. Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was\nnot long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else\nbut looking at the lady\u2019s eyes, and doing everything that she wished.\nThen the old woman said, \u2018Now is the time for getting the bird\u2019s heart.\u2019\nSo the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his\npillow, for it lay now under the young lady\u2019s, and the old woman took it\naway every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his\nprize.\n\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said the old witch, \u2018we have got the bird\u2019s heart, but not the\nwishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.\u2019 \u2018Let us leave him that,\u2019\nsaid the young lady; \u2018he has already lost his wealth.\u2019 Then the witch\nwas very angry, and said, \u2018Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful\nthing, and I must and will have it.\u2019 So she did as the old woman told\nher, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and\nseemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, \u2018What makes you so sad?\u2019\n\u2018Alas! dear sir,\u2019 said she, \u2018yonder lies the granite rock where all the\ncostly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I\nthink of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only\nthe birds and the flies--man cannot.\u2019 \u2018If that\u2019s all your grief,\u2019 said\nthe huntsman, \u2018I\u2019ll take you there with all my heart\u2019; so he drew her under\nhis cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they\nwere both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were\ndelighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch\nmade a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, \u2018Let us\nsit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand\nany longer.\u2019 So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and\nfell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from\nhis shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished\nherself home again.\n\nWhen he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him\nalone on the wild rock, he said, \u2018Alas! what roguery there is in the\nworld!\u2019 and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to\ndo. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as\nhe saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, \u2018I can only\nsave myself by feigning to be asleep\u2019; so he laid himself down as if he\nwere in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed\nhim with his foot, and said, \u2018What worm is this that lies here curled\nup?\u2019 \u2018Tread upon him and kill him,\u2019 said the second. \u2018It\u2019s not worth the\ntrouble,\u2019 said the third; \u2018let him live, he\u2019ll go climbing higher up the\nmountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.\u2019 And they\npassed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they\nwere gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat\nthere a short time a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a\nwhirlwind and bore him along for some time, till it settled in a garden,\nand he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.\n\nThen he looked around him, and said, \u2018I wish I had something to eat, if\nnot I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples\nnor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.\u2019 At last he\nthought to himself, \u2018I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen\nme.\u2019 So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he\nswallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with\nhorror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very\nhungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came\nto another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt\nanother change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to\nhave found his old shape again.\n\nThen he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and\nwhen he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and\nthe bad salad, and thought to himself, \u2018This will help me to my fortune\nagain, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.\u2019 So he\nwent away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering\nabout a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over\nbrown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into\nthe castle and asked for a lodging; \u2018I am so tired,\u2019 said he, \u2018that I\ncan go no farther.\u2019 \u2018Countryman,\u2019 said the witch, \u2018who are you? and what\nis your business?\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 said he, \u2018a messenger sent by the king to\nfind the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky\nenough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun\nscorches so that it begins to wither, and I don\u2019t know that I can carry\nit farther.\u2019\n\nWhen the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they\nlonged to taste it, and said, \u2018Dear countryman, let us just taste it.\u2019\n\u2018To be sure,\u2019 answered he; \u2018I have two heads of it with me, and will\ngive you one\u2019; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the\nwitch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was\nready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves\nimmediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed\nwhen she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the\nform of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing\nthe salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a\nwish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she\nalso was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish\nwith the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with\nthe beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she\nlonged to taste it, she said, \u2018I don\u2019t know where the salad can be.\u2019\nThen he thought something must have happened, and said, \u2018I will go\ninto the kitchen and see.\u2019 And as he went he saw two asses in the court\nrunning about, and the salad lying on the ground. \u2018All right!\u2019 said\nhe; \u2018those two have had their share.\u2019 Then he took up the rest of\nthe leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady,\nsaying, \u2018I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.\u2019\nSo she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying\naway.\n\nThen the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they\nmight know him. \u2018Now you shall be paid for your roguery,\u2019 said he; and\ntied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he\ncame to a mill and knocked at the window. \u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 said the\nmiller. \u2018I have three tiresome beasts here,\u2019 said the other; \u2018if you\nwill take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you,\nI will pay you whatever you ask.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said the miller;\n\u2018but how shall I treat them?\u2019 Then the huntsman said, \u2018Give the old\none stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was\nthe servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give\nthe youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and\nno stripes\u2019: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.\nAfter this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he\nwanted.\n\nSome days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass\nwas dead; \u2018The other two,\u2019 said he, \u2018are alive and eat, but are so\nsorrowful that they cannot last long.\u2019 Then the huntsman pitied them,\nand told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he\ngave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady\nfell upon her knees before him, and said, \u2018O dearest huntsman! forgive\nme all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was\nagainst my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak\nhangs up in the closet, and as for the bird\u2019s heart, I will give it you\ntoo.\u2019 But he said, \u2018Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean\nto make you my wife.\u2019 So they were married, and lived together very\nhappily till they died.", "The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was": "A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,\nand could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither\nlearn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:\n\u2018There\u2019s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!\u2019 When anything\nhad to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but\nif his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the\nnight-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal\nplace, he answered: \u2018Oh, no father, I\u2019ll not go there, it makes me\nshudder!\u2019 for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at\nnight which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: \u2018Oh,\nit makes us shudder!\u2019 The younger sat in a corner and listened with\nthe rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. \u2018They are\nalways saying: \u201cIt makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!\u201d It does not\nmake me shudder,\u2019 thought he. \u2018That, too, must be an art of which I\nunderstand nothing!\u2019\n\nNow it came to pass that his father said to him one day: \u2018Hearken to me,\nyou fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you\ntoo must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your\nbrother works, but you do not even earn your salt.\u2019 \u2018Well, father,\u2019 he\nreplied, \u2018I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but\nbe managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don\u2019t understand\nthat at all yet.\u2019 The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and\nthought to himself: \u2018Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!\nHe will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to\nbe a sickle must bend himself betimes.\u2019\n\nThe father sighed, and answered him: \u2018You shall soon learn what it is to\nshudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.\u2019\n\nSoon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father\nbewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward\nin every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. \u2018Just think,\u2019\nsaid he, \u2018when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he\nactually wanted to learn to shudder.\u2019 \u2018If that be all,\u2019 replied the\nsexton, \u2018he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon\npolish him.\u2019 The father was glad to do it, for he thought: \u2018It will\ntrain the boy a little.\u2019 The sexton therefore took him into his house,\nand he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke\nhim at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and\nring the bell. \u2018You shall soon learn what shuddering is,\u2019 thought he,\nand secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of\nthe tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell\nrope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding\nhole. \u2018Who is there?\u2019 cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did\nnot move or stir. \u2018Give an answer,\u2019 cried the boy, \u2018or take yourself\noff, you have no business here at night.\u2019\n\nThe sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might\nthink he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: \u2018What do you want\nhere?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the\nsteps!\u2019 The sexton thought: \u2018He can\u2019t mean to be as bad as his words,\u2019\nuttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy\ncalled to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,\nhe ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell\ndown the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he\nrang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and\nfell asleep. The sexton\u2019s wife waited a long time for her husband, but\nhe did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,\nand asked: \u2018Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower\nbefore you did.\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 replied the boy, \u2018but someone was\nstanding by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he\nwould neither gave an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,\nand threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.\nI should be sorry if it were.\u2019 The woman ran away and found her husband,\nwho was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.\n\nShe carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the\nboy\u2019s father, \u2018Your boy,\u2019 cried she, \u2018has been the cause of a great\nmisfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his\nleg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.\u2019 The father was\nterrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. \u2018What wicked tricks\nare these?\u2019 said he. \u2018The devil must have put them into your head.\u2019\n\u2018Father,\u2019 he replied, \u2018do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was\nstanding there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know\nwho it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go\naway.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said the father, \u2018I have nothing but unhappiness with you.\nGo out of my sight. I will see you no more.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I\ngo forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,\nunderstand one art which will support me.\u2019 \u2018Learn what you will,\u2019 spoke\nthe father, \u2018it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.\nTake these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you\ncome, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than\nthat, I can easily keep it in mind.\u2019\n\nWhen the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his\npocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to\nhimself: \u2018If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\u2019 Then a man\napproached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with\nhimself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could\nsee the gallows, the man said to him: \u2018Look, there is the tree where\nseven men have married the ropemaker\u2019s daughter, and are now learning\nhow to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will\nsoon learn how to shudder.\u2019 \u2018If that is all that is wanted,\u2019 answered\nthe youth, \u2018it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as\nthat, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the\nmorning.\u2019 Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and\nwaited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,\nbut at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he\ncould not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each\nother, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:\n\u2018If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and\nsuffer!\u2019 And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed\nup, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.\nThen he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm\nthemselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught\ntheir clothes. So he said: \u2018Take care, or I will hang you up again.\u2019 The\ndead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their\nrags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: \u2018If you will not\ntake care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,\u2019 and he hung\nthem up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell\nasleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have\nthe fifty talers, and said: \u2018Well do you know how to shudder?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019\nanswered he, \u2018how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open\ntheir mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which\nthey had on their bodies get burnt.\u2019 Then the man saw that he would not\nget the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: \u2018Such a youth has\nnever come my way before.\u2019\n\nThe youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to\nhimself: \u2018Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!\u2019 A\nwaggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: \u2018Who are\nyou?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: \u2018From\nwhence do you come?\u2019 \u2018I know not.\u2019 \u2018Who is your father?\u2019 \u2018That I may\nnot tell you.\u2019 \u2018What is it that you are always muttering between your\nteeth?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 replied the youth, \u2018I do so wish I could shudder, but\nno one can teach me how.\u2019 \u2018Enough of your foolish chatter,\u2019 said the\nwaggoner. \u2018Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.\u2019 The\nyouth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn\nwhere they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour\nthe youth again said quite loudly: \u2018If I could but shudder! If I could\nbut shudder!\u2019 The host who heard this, laughed and said: \u2018If that is\nyour desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\nbe silent,\u2019 said the hostess, \u2018so many prying persons have already lost\ntheir lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as\nthese should never see the daylight again.\u2019\n\nBut the youth said: \u2018However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For\nthis purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.\u2019 He let the host have\nno rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a\nhaunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,\nif he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that\nhe who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the\nmost beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great\ntreasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would\nthen be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men\nhad gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the\nyouth went next morning to the king, and said: \u2018If it be allowed, I will\nwillingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.\u2019\n\nThe king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: \u2018You may\nask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must\nbe things without life.\u2019 Then he answered: \u2018Then I ask for a fire, a\nturning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.\u2019\n\nThe king had these things carried into the castle for him during the\nday. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself\na bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife\nbeside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. \u2018Ah, if I could\nbut shudder!\u2019 said he, \u2018but I shall not learn it here either.\u2019 Towards\nmidnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,\nsomething cried suddenly from one corner: \u2018Au, miau! how cold we are!\u2019\n\u2018You fools!\u2019 cried he, \u2018what are you crying about? If you are cold, come\nand take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.\u2019 And when he had said\nthat, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down\non each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery\neyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:\n\u2018Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?\u2019 \u2018Why not?\u2019 he replied, \u2018but\njust show me your paws.\u2019 Then they stretched out their claws. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said\nhe, \u2018what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.\u2019\nThereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board\nand screwed their feet fast. \u2018I have looked at your fingers,\u2019 said he,\n\u2018and my fancy for card-playing has gone,\u2019 and he struck them dead and\nthrew them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,\nand was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and\ncorner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more\nand more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled\nhorribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put\nit out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were\ngoing too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: \u2018Away with you,\nvermin,\u2019 and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others\nhe killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned\nthe embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his\neyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he\nlooked round and saw a great bed in the corner. \u2018That is the very thing\nfor me,\u2019 said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his\neyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over\nthe whole of the castle. \u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 said he, \u2018but go faster.\u2019 Then\nthe bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,\nover thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside\ndown, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up\nin the air, got out and said: \u2018Now anyone who likes, may drive,\u2019 and\nlay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king\ncame, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil\nspirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: \u2018After all it is a\npity,--for so handsome a man.\u2019 The youth heard it, got up, and said: \u2018It\nhas not come to that yet.\u2019 Then the king was astonished, but very glad,\nand asked how he had fared. \u2018Very well indeed,\u2019 answered he; \u2018one\nnight is past, the two others will pass likewise.\u2019 Then he went to the\ninnkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: \u2018I never expected to\nsee you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said he,\n\u2018it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!\u2019\n\nThe second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the\nfire, and once more began his old song: \u2018If I could but shudder!\u2019 When\nmidnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at\nfirst it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for\na while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the\nchimney and fell before him. \u2018Hullo!\u2019 cried he, \u2018another half belongs\nto this. This is not enough!\u2019 Then the uproar began again, there was a\nroaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. \u2018Wait,\u2019 said\nhe, \u2018I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.\u2019 When he had done\nthat and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a\nhideous man was sitting in his place. \u2018That is no part of our bargain,\u2019\nsaid the youth, \u2018the bench is mine.\u2019 The man wanted to push him away;\nthe youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all\nhis strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more\nmen fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men\u2019s legs\nand two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The\nyouth also wanted to play and said: \u2018Listen you, can I join you?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\nif you have any money.\u2019 \u2018Money enough,\u2019 replied he, \u2018but your balls are\nnot quite round.\u2019 Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and\nturned them till they were round. \u2018There, now they will roll better!\u2019\nsaid he. \u2018Hurrah! now we\u2019ll have fun!\u2019 He played with them and lost some\nof his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his\nsight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came\nto inquire after him. \u2018How has it fared with you this time?\u2019 asked he.\n\u2018I have been playing at nine-pins,\u2019 he answered, \u2018and have lost a couple\nof farthings.\u2019 \u2018Have you not shuddered then?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said he, \u2018I have\nhad a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!\u2019\n\nThe third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:\n\u2018If I could but shudder.\u2019 When it grew late, six tall men came in and\nbrought a coffin. Then he said: \u2018Ha, ha, that is certainly my little\ncousin, who died only a few days ago,\u2019 and he beckoned with his finger,\nand cried: \u2018Come, little cousin, come.\u2019 They placed the coffin on the\nground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay\ntherein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. \u2018Wait,\u2019 said he, \u2018I\nwill warm you a little,\u2019 and went to the fire and warmed his hand and\nlaid it on the dead man\u2019s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him\nout, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his\narms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he\nthought to himself: \u2018When two people lie in bed together, they warm each\nother,\u2019 and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by\nhim. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.\nThen said the youth, \u2018See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?\u2019 The\ndead man, however, got up and cried: \u2018Now will I strangle you.\u2019\n\n\u2018What!\u2019 said he, \u2018is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go\ninto your coffin again,\u2019 and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut\nthe lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. \u2018I cannot\nmanage to shudder,\u2019 said he. \u2018I shall never learn it here as long as I\nlive.\u2019\n\nThen a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.\nHe was old, however, and had a long white beard. \u2018You wretch,\u2019 cried he,\n\u2018you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.\u2019 \u2018Not so\nfast,\u2019 replied the youth. \u2018If I am to die, I shall have to have a say\nin it.\u2019 \u2018I will soon seize you,\u2019 said the fiend. \u2018Softly, softly, do not\ntalk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.\u2019\n\u2018We shall see,\u2019 said the old man. \u2018If you are stronger, I will let you\ngo--come, we will try.\u2019 Then he led him by dark passages to a smith\u2019s\nforge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.\n\u2018I can do better than that,\u2019 said the youth, and went to the other\nanvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his\nwhite beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil\nwith one blow, and in it caught the old man\u2019s beard. \u2018Now I have you,\u2019\nsaid the youth. \u2018Now it is your turn to die.\u2019 Then he seized an iron bar\nand beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he\nwould give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.\nThe old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him\nthree chests full of gold. \u2018Of these,\u2019 said he, \u2018one part is for the\npoor, the other for the king, the third yours.\u2019 In the meantime it\nstruck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in\ndarkness. \u2018I shall still be able to find my way out,\u2019 said he, and felt\nabout, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.\nNext morning the king came and said: \u2018Now you must have learnt what\nshuddering is?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 he answered; \u2018what can it be? My dead cousin was\nhere, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down\nbelow, but no one told me what it was to shudder.\u2019 \u2018Then,\u2019 said the\nking, \u2018you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.\u2019 \u2018That\nis all very well,\u2019 said he, \u2018but still I do not know what it is to\nshudder!\u2019\n\nThen the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever\nmuch the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still\nsaid always: \u2018If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.\u2019 And this\nat last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: \u2018I will find a cure for him;\nhe shall soon learn what it is to shudder.\u2019 She went out to the stream\nwhich flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons\nbrought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was\nto draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water\nwith the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would\nsprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: \u2018Oh, what makes me shudder\nso?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to\nshudder!\u2019", "King Grisly-Beard": "A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very\nbeautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the\nprinces who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she\nonly made sport of them.\n\nOnce upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all\nher suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their\nrank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,\nand knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she\nhad something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: \u2018He\u2019s\nas round as a tub,\u2019 said she. The next was too tall: \u2018What a maypole!\u2019\nsaid she. The next was too short: \u2018What a dumpling!\u2019 said she. The\nfourth was too pale, and she called him \u2018Wallface.\u2019 The fifth was too\nred, so she called him \u2018Coxcomb.\u2019 The sixth was not straight enough;\nso she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over\na baker\u2019s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but\nshe laughed more than all at a good king who was there. \u2018Look at\nhim,\u2019 said she; \u2018his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called\nGrisly-beard.\u2019 So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.\n\nBut the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,\nand how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or\nunwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that\ncame to the door.\n\nTwo days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play\nunder the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,\n\u2018Let him come in.\u2019 So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when\nhe had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the\nking said, \u2018You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for\nyour wife.\u2019 The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, \u2018I have\nsworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.\u2019 So words\nand tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married\nto the fiddler. When this was over the king said, \u2018Now get ready to\ngo--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.\u2019\n\nThen the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came\nto a great wood. \u2018Pray,\u2019 said she, \u2018whose is this wood?\u2019 \u2018It belongs\nto King Grisly-beard,\u2019 answered he; \u2018hadst thou taken him, all had been\nthine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 sighed she; \u2018would that I had\nmarried King Grisly-beard!\u2019 Next they came to some fine meadows. \u2018Whose\nare these beautiful green meadows?\u2019 said she. \u2018They belong to King\nGrisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\nunlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 said she; \u2018would that I had married King\nGrisly-beard!\u2019\n\nThen they came to a great city. \u2018Whose is this noble city?\u2019 said she.\n\u2018It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been\nthine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! wretch that I am!\u2019 sighed she; \u2018why did I not marry King\nGrisly-beard?\u2019 \u2018That is no business of mine,\u2019 said the fiddler: \u2018why\nshould you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?\u2019\n\nAt last they came to a small cottage. \u2018What a paltry place!\u2019 said she;\n\u2018to whom does that little dirty hole belong?\u2019 Then the fiddler said,\n\u2018That is your and my house, where we are to live.\u2019 \u2018Where are your\nservants?\u2019 cried she. \u2018What do we want with servants?\u2019 said he; \u2018you\nmust do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put\non water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.\u2019 But the princess knew\nnothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help\nher. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the\nfiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus\nthey lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the\ncottage, the man said, \u2018Wife, we can\u2019t go on thus, spending money and\nearning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.\u2019 Then he went out and\ncut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made\nher fingers very sore. \u2018I see this work won\u2019t do,\u2019 said he: \u2018try and\nspin; perhaps you will do that better.\u2019 So she sat down and tried to\nspin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. \u2018See\nnow,\u2019 said the fiddler, \u2018you are good for nothing; you can do no work:\nwhat a bargain I have got! However, I\u2019ll try and set up a trade in pots\nand pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019\nsighed she, \u2018if any of my father\u2019s court should pass by and see me\nstanding in the market, how they will laugh at me!\u2019\n\nBut her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she\ndid not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many\npeople, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid\ntheir money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on\nthis as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of\nware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but\na drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,\nand broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,\nand knew not what to do. \u2018Ah! what will become of me?\u2019 said she; \u2018what\nwill my husband say?\u2019 So she ran home and told him all. \u2018Who would\nhave thought you would have been so silly,\u2019 said he, \u2018as to put an\nearthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?\nbut let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of\nwork, so I have been to the king\u2019s palace, and asked if they did not\nwant a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will\nhave plenty to eat.\u2019\n\nThus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all\nthe dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat\nthat was left, and on this they lived.\n\nShe had not been there long before she heard that the king\u2019s eldest son\nwas passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows\nand looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of\nthe court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly\nwhich had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich\nmeats, which she put into her basket to take home.\n\nAll on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king\u2019s son in golden\nclothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her\nby the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she\ntrembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was\nmaking sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the\ncover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then\neverybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she\nwished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the\ndoor to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and\nbrought her back and said, \u2018Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived\nwith you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I\nam also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only\nto cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your\nill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is\ntime to hold our marriage feast.\u2019\n\nThen the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and\nher father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home\non her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was\ngrand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you\nand I had been of the party.", "Iron Hans": "There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his\npalace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a\nhuntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. \u2018Perhaps some\naccident has befallen him,\u2019 said the king, and the next day he sent out\ntwo more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.\nThen on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: \u2018Scour\nthe whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all\nthree.\u2019 But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again.\nFrom that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,\nand it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen\nof it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for\nmany years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as\nseeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The\nking, however, would not give his consent, and said: \u2018It is not safe in\nthere; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others,\nand you would never come out again.\u2019 The huntsman replied: \u2018Lord, I will\nventure it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.\u2019\n\nThe huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was\nnot long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to\npursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a\ndeep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of\nthe water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he\nwent back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the\nwater. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body\nwas brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his\nknees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There\nwas great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put\nin an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened\non pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her\nkeeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the\nforest with safety.\n\nThe king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the\ncourtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.\nThe boy ran thither and said: \u2018Give me my ball out.\u2019 \u2018Not till you have\nopened the door for me,\u2019 answered the man. \u2018No,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018I will\nnot do that; the king has forbidden it,\u2019 and ran away. The next day he\nagain went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: \u2018Open my door,\u2019\nbut the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting,\nand the boy went once more and said: \u2018I cannot open the door even if I\nwished, for I have not the key.\u2019 Then the wild man said: \u2018It lies under\nyour mother\u2019s pillow, you can get it there.\u2019 The boy, who wanted to have\nhis ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The\ndoor opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it\nwas open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried\naway. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: \u2018Oh,\nwild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!\u2019 The wild man turned\nback, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps\ninto the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage,\nand asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it,\nand sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one\nanswered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but\nthey did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and\nmuch grief reigned in the royal court.\n\nWhen the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy\ndown from his shoulder, and said to him: \u2018You will never see your father\nand mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,\nand I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare\nwell. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the\nworld.\u2019 He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the\nnext morning the man took him to a well, and said: \u2018Behold, the gold\nwell is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and\ntake care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will\ncome every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.\u2019 The boy placed\nhimself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a\ngolden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.\nAs he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he\ninvoluntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw\nthat it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold\noff again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back,\nlooked at the boy, and said: \u2018What has happened to the well?\u2019 \u2018Nothing\nnothing,\u2019 he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the\nman might not see it. But he said: \u2018You have dipped your finger into\nthe water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let\nanything go in.\u2019 By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and\nwatching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head,\nand then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly\nout, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew\nwhat had happened. \u2018You have let a hair fall into the well,\u2019 said he.\n\u2018I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the\nthird time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with\nme.\u2019\n\nOn the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,\nhowever much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at\nthe reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he\nstill bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look\nstraight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into\nthe water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of\nhis head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how\nterrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it\nround his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he\nalready knew everything, and said: \u2018Take the handkerchief off.\u2019 Then the\ngolden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might,\nit was of no use. \u2018You have not stood the trial and can stay here no\nlonger. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.\nBut as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is\none thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the\nforest and cry: \u201cIron Hans,\u201d and then I will come and help you. My\npower is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in\nabundance.\u2019\n\nThen the king\u2019s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten\npaths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he\nlooked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he\ncould help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they\nwould take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use\nthey could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At\nlength the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood\nand water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that\nno one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the\nroyal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he\nkept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under\nthe king\u2019s notice, and he said: \u2018When you come to the royal table you\nmust take your hat off.\u2019 He answered: \u2018Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad\nsore place on my head.\u2019 Then the king had the cook called before him\nand scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his\nservice; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however,\nhad pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener\u2019s boy.\n\nAnd now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear\nthe wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in\nthe garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air\nmight cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so\nthat the rays fell into the bedroom of the king\u2019s daughter, and up she\nsprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to\nhim: \u2018Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.\u2019 He put his cap on with all\nhaste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he\nwas ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: \u2018How\ncan you take the king\u2019s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go\nquickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\nno,\u2019 replied the boy, \u2018the wild ones have more scent, and will please\nher better.\u2019 When he got into the room, the king\u2019s daughter said: \u2018Take\nyour cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.\u2019 He again\nsaid: \u2018I may not, I have a sore head.\u2019 She, however, caught at his\ncap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his\nshoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she\nheld him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he\ndeparted, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the\ngardener, and said: \u2018I present them to your children, they can play with\nthem.\u2019 The following day the king\u2019s daughter again called to him that he\nwas to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it,\nshe instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him,\nbut he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of\nducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for\nplaythings for his children. On the third day things went just the\nsame; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her\nmoney.\n\nNot long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered\ntogether his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any\nopposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty\narmy. Then said the gardener\u2019s boy: \u2018I am grown up, and will go to the\nwars also, only give me a horse.\u2019 The others laughed, and said: \u2018Seek\none for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the\nstable for you.\u2019 When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and\nled the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib,\nhobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark\nforest. When he came to the outskirts, he called \u2018Iron Hans\u2019 three\ntimes so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man\nappeared immediately, and said: \u2018What do you desire?\u2019 \u2018I want a strong\nsteed, for I am going to the wars.\u2019 \u2018That you shall have, and still more\nthan you ask for.\u2019 Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it\nwas not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that\nsnorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind\nthem followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and\ntheir swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged\nhorse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the\nsoldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king\u2019s\nmen had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give\nway. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like\na hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They\nbegan to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there\nwas not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he\nconducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron\nHans. \u2018What do you desire?\u2019 asked the wild man. \u2018Take back your horse\nand your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.\u2019 All that he\nasked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When\nthe king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and\nwished him joy of his victory. \u2018I am not the one who carried away the\nvictory,\u2019 said he, \u2018but a strange knight who came to my assistance with\nhis soldiers.\u2019 The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was,\nbut the king did not know, and said: \u2018He followed the enemy, and I did\nnot see him again.\u2019 She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but\nhe smiled, and said: \u2018He has just come home on his three-legged horse,\nand the others have been mocking him, and crying: \u201cHere comes our\nhobblety jib back again!\u201d They asked, too: \u201cUnder what hedge have you\nbeen lying sleeping all the time?\u201d So he said: \u201cI did the best of all,\nand it would have gone badly without me.\u201d And then he was still more\nridiculed.\u2019\n\nThe king said to his daughter: \u2018I will proclaim a great feast that shall\nlast for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the\nunknown man will show himself.\u2019 When the feast was announced, the youth\nwent out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. \u2018What do you desire?\u2019\nasked he. \u2018That I may catch the king\u2019s daughter\u2019s golden apple.\u2019 \u2018It is\nas safe as if you had it already,\u2019 said Iron Hans. \u2018You shall likewise\nhave a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited\nchestnut-horse.\u2019 When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took\nhis place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king\u2019s\ndaughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none\nof them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.\n\nOn the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him\na white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and\nhe did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew\nangry, and said: \u2018That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell\nhis name.\u2019 He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple,\nshould go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come\nback willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.\n\nOn the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and\na black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off\nwith it, the king\u2019s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near\nhim that he wounded the youth\u2019s leg with the point of his sword. The\nyouth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently\nthat the helmet fell from the youth\u2019s head, and they could see that he\nhad golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.\n\nThe following day the king\u2019s daughter asked the gardener about his\nboy. \u2018He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the\nfestival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise\nshown my children three golden apples which he has won.\u2019\n\nThe king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had\nhis little cap on his head. But the king\u2019s daughter went up to him and\ntook it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and\nhe was so handsome that all were amazed. \u2018Are you the knight who came\nevery day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught\nthe three golden apples?\u2019 asked the king. \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered he, \u2018and here\nthe apples are,\u2019 and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them\nto the king. \u2018If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which\nyour people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight\nwho helped you to your victory over your enemies.\u2019 \u2018If you can perform\nsuch deeds as that, you are no gardener\u2019s boy; tell me, who is your\nfather?\u2019 \u2018My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great\nas I require.\u2019 \u2018I well see,\u2019 said the king, \u2018that I owe my thanks to\nyou; can I do anything to please you?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered he, \u2018that indeed\nyou can. Give me your daughter to wife.\u2019 The maiden laughed, and said:\n\u2018He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his\ngolden hair that he was no gardener\u2019s boy,\u2019 and then she went and\nkissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great\ndelight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear\nson again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music\nsuddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a\ngreat retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: \u2018I am\nIron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free;\nall the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.\u2019", "Cat-Skin": "There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was\nso beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of\nthe earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her\nend drew near she called the king to her and said, \u2018Promise me that you\nwill never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful\nas I am, and who has golden hair like mine.\u2019 Then when the king in his\ngrief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king\nwas not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking\nanother wife. At last, however, his wise men said, \u2018this will not do;\nthe king must marry again, that we may have a queen.\u2019 So messengers were\nsent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.\nBut there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had\nbeen, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the\nmessengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.\n\nNow the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,\nand had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked\nat her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to\nhis courtiers, \u2018May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my\ndead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole\nearth, and you say there must be a queen.\u2019 When the courtiers heard this\nthey were shocked, and said, \u2018Heaven forbid that a father should marry\nhis daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.\u2019 And his daughter\nwas also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;\nso she said to him, \u2018Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:\none must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,\nlike the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,\nI want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to\nwhich every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.\u2019 And thus\nshe thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the\nmost skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,\nlike the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,\nlike the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in\nhis kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a\nmantle of a thousand furs was made.\n\nWhen all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the\nnight when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden\nring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three\ndresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and\nwrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared\nher face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for\nhelp in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till\nat last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself\ndown in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept\non till it was midday.\n\nNow as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs\ncame to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and\nbark. \u2018Look sharp!\u2019 said the king to the huntsmen, \u2018and see what sort\nof game lies there.\u2019 And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they\ncame back again said, \u2018In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful\nbeast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand\nkinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.\u2019 \u2018See,\u2019 said the king, \u2018if\nyou can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.\u2019 So the huntsmen\ntook it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,\n\u2018I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on\nme and take me with you.\u2019 Then they said, \u2018Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will\ndo for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that\nsort.\u2019 So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king\u2019s\npalace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where\nno light of day ever peeped in, and said, \u2018Cat-skin, you may lie and\nsleep there.\u2019 And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood\nand water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the\nashes, and do all the dirty work.\n\nThus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. \u2018Ah! pretty\nprincess!\u2019 thought she, \u2018what will now become of thee?\u2019 But it happened\none day that a feast was to be held in the king\u2019s castle, so she said to\nthe cook, \u2018May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will\ntake care and stand behind the door.\u2019 And the cook said, \u2018Yes, you may\ngo, but be back again in half an hour\u2019s time, to rake out the ashes.\u2019\nThen she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the\nfur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her\nbeauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened\nher nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,\nand so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew\nher, and they thought she could be no less than a king\u2019s daughter. But\nthe king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and\nhe thought in his heart, \u2018I never saw any one half so beautiful.\u2019\n\nWhen the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked\nround for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood\nat the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth\nwas, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,\nblackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was\nCat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began\nto rake the ashes, the cook said, \u2018Let that alone till the morning, and\nheat the king\u2019s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but\ntake care you don\u2019t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of\nnever eating again.\u2019\n\nAs soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king\u2019s soup, and\ntoasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it\nwas ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,\nand put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,\nthe king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,\nthat he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom\nhe saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got\nthere, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when\nhe heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, \u2018You must have let a hair fall\ninto the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.\u2019 Then he went\nbefore the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. \u2018I did,\u2019\nanswered the cook. But the king said, \u2018That is not true; it was better\ndone than you could do it.\u2019 Then he answered, \u2018To tell the truth I did\nnot cook it, but Cat-skin did.\u2019 \u2018Then let Cat-skin come up,\u2019 said the\nking: and when she came he said to her, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \u2018I am a poor\nchild,\u2019 said she, \u2018that has lost both father and mother.\u2019 \u2018How came you\nin my palace?\u2019 asked he. \u2018I am good for nothing,\u2019 said she, \u2018but to be\nscullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.\u2019 \u2018But how\ndid you get the ring that was in the soup?\u2019 asked the king. Then she\nwould not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent\nher away again about her business.\n\nAfter a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let\nher go up and see it as before. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said he, \u2018but come again in half\nan hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.\u2019 Then she\nran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress\nout which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,\nlooking like a king\u2019s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at\nseeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the\ndance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did\nnot see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and\nmade herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the\nsoup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and\ndropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,\nand it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who\nwas again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was\nbrought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only\nfit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.\n\nBut when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third\ntime, it happened just the same as before. \u2018You must be a witch,\nCat-skin,\u2019 said the cook; \u2018for you always put something into your soup,\nso that it pleases the king better than mine.\u2019 However, he let her go up\nas before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and\nwent into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and\nthought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst\nhe was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her\nseeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.\nWhen it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she\nslipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight\nof her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under\nthe stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the\nhalf-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her\nfur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over\nwith soot, but left one of her fingers white.\n\nThen she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king\u2019s soup; and as soon\nas the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the\nking got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and\nsoon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst\nthey were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and\nwhen she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off\na little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.\n\nThen he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and\nbeautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she\nwashed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the\nmost beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,\n\u2018You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each\nother.\u2019 And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever\nwas heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.", "Snow-White and Rose-Red": "There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of\nthe cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore\nwhite and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the\ntwo rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.\nThey were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children\nin the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than\nRose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields\nseeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home\nwith her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when\nthere was nothing to do.\n\nThe two children were so fond of one another that they always held each\nother by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said:\n\u2018We will not leave each other,\u2019 Rose-red answered: \u2018Never so long as we\nlive,\u2019 and their mother would add: \u2018What one has she must share with the\nother.\u2019\n\nThey often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no\nbeasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little\nhare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by\ntheir side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon\nthe boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\n\nNo mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and\nnight came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss,\nand slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not\nworry on their account.\n\nOnce when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused\nthem, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near\ntheir bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing\nand went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that\nthey had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly\nhave fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces\nfurther. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who\nwatches over good children.\n\nSnow-white and Rose-red kept their mother\u2019s little cottage so neat that\nit was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care\nof the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother\u2019s\nbed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter\nSnow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle\nwas of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the\nevening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: \u2018Go, Snow-white, and\nbolt the door,\u2019 and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took\nher spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls\nlistened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the\nfloor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head\nhidden beneath its wings.\n\nOne evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone\nknocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said:\n\u2018Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking\nshelter.\u2019 Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a\npoor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black\nhead within the door.\n\nRose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered,\nand Snow-white hid herself behind her mother\u2019s bed. But the bear began\nto speak and said: \u2018Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am\nhalf-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Poor bear,\u2019 said the mother, \u2018lie down by the fire, only take care that\nyou do not burn your coat.\u2019 Then she cried: \u2018Snow-white, Rose-red, come\nout, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.\u2019 So they both came\nout, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid\nof him. The bear said: \u2018Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a\nlittle\u2019; so they brought the broom and swept the bear\u2019s hide clean;\nand he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and\ncomfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played\ntricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands,\nput their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a\nhazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the\nbear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called\nout: \u2018Leave me alive, children,\n\n  Snow-white, Rose-red,\n  Will you beat your wooer dead?\u2019\n\nWhen it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the\nbear: \u2018You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from\nthe cold and the bad weather.\u2019 As soon as day dawned the two children\nlet him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.\n\nHenceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself\ndown by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as\nmuch as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were\nnever fastened until their black friend had arrived.\n\nWhen spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one\nmorning to Snow-white: \u2018Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the\nwhole summer.\u2019 \u2018Where are you going, then, dear bear?\u2019 asked Snow-white.\n\u2018I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked\ndwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged\nto stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun\nhas thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to\npry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves,\ndoes not easily see daylight again.\u2019\n\nSnow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the\ndoor for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt\nand a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white\nas if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about\nit. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the\ntrees.\n\nA short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest\nto get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the\nground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and\nforwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When\nthey came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a\nsnow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a\ncrevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog\ntied to a rope, and did not know what to do.\n\nHe glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: \u2018Why do you\nstand there? Can you not come here and help me?\u2019 \u2018What are you up to,\nlittle man?\u2019 asked Rose-red. \u2018You stupid, prying goose!\u2019 answered the\ndwarf: \u2018I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.\nThe little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with\nheavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had\njust driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished;\nbut the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the\ntree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white\nbeard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek,\nmilk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!\u2019\n\nThe children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it\nwas caught too fast. \u2018I will run and fetch someone,\u2019 said Rose-red. \u2018You\nsenseless goose!\u2019 snarled the dwarf; \u2018why should you fetch someone? You\nare already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t be impatient,\u2019 said Snow-white, \u2018I will help you,\u2019 and she pulled\nher scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\n\nAs soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay\namongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it\nup, grumbling to himself: \u2018Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine\nbeard. Bad luck to you!\u2019 and then he swung the bag upon his back, and\nwent off without even once looking at the children.\n\nSome time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish\nof fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large\ngrasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.\nThey ran to it and found it was the dwarf. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 said\nRose-red; \u2018you surely don\u2019t want to go into the water?\u2019 \u2018I am not such\na fool!\u2019 cried the dwarf; \u2018don\u2019t you see that the accursed fish wants\nto pull me in?\u2019 The little man had been sitting there fishing, and\nunluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a\nmoment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not\nstrength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the\ndwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of\nlittle good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and\nwas in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.\n\nThe girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his\nbeard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast\ntogether. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut\nthe beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that\nhe screamed out: \u2018Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man\u2019s\nface? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have\ncut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people.\nI wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!\u2019 Then he took\nout a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word\nhe dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.\n\nIt happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the\ntown to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them\nacross a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There\nthey noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and\nround above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a\nrock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran\nup and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance\nthe dwarf, and was going to carry him off.\n\nThe children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man,\nand pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.\nAs soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried\nwith his shrill voice: \u2018Could you not have done it more carefully! You\ndragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you\nclumsy creatures!\u2019 Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and\nslipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by\nthis time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their\nbusiness in town.\n\nAs they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the\ndwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,\nand had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening\nsun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with\nall colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared\nat them. \u2018Why do you stand gaping there?\u2019 cried the dwarf, and his\nashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a\nloud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out\nof the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach\nhis cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart\nhe cried: \u2018Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures;\nlook, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you\nwant with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me\nbetween your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender\nmorsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy\u2019s sake eat them!\u2019 The\nbear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single\nblow with his paw, and he did not move again.\n\nThe girls had run away, but the bear called to them: \u2018Snow-white and\nRose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.\u2019 Then they\nrecognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly\nhis bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in\ngold. \u2018I am a king\u2019s son,\u2019 he said, \u2018and I was bewitched by that wicked\ndwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest\nas a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his\nwell-deserved punishment.\n\nSnow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they\ndivided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered\ntogether in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with\nher children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and\nthey stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful\nroses, white and red.", "The Frog King, or Iron Henry": "In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king\nwhose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful\nthat the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever\nit shone in her face.  Close by the king's castle lay a great dark\nforest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when\nthe day was very warm, the king's child went out into the forest and\nsat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was bored she\ntook a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this\nball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball\ndid not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it,\nbut on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water.  The\nking's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the\nwell was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen.  At this\nshe began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be\ncomforted.  And as she thus lamented someone said to her, \"What ails\nyou, king's daughter?  You weep so that even a stone would show pity.\"\n\nShe looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a\nfrog stretching forth its big, ugly head from the water.  \"Ah, old\nwater-splasher, is it you,\" she said, \"I am weeping for my golden ball,\nwhich has fallen into the well.\"  \"Be quiet, and do not weep,\" answered\nthe frog, \"I can help you, but what will you give me if I bring your\nplaything up again?\"  \"Whatever you will have, dear frog,\" said she, \"My\nclothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am\nwearing.\"  The frog answered, \"I do not care for your clothes, your\npearls and jewels, nor for your golden crown, but if you will love me\nand let me be your companion and play-fellow, and sit by you at your\nlittle table, and eat off your little golden plate, and drink out of\nyour little cup, and sleep in your little bed - if you will promise\nme this I will go down below, and bring you your golden ball up\nagain.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said she, \"I promise you all you wish, if you will but bring\nme my ball back again.\"  But she thought, \"How the silly frog does\ntalk.  All he does is to sit in the water with the other frogs, and\ncroak.  He can be no companion to any human being.\"\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the\nwater and sank down; and in a short while came swimmming up again\nwith the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass.  The king's\ndaughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and\npicked it up, and ran away with it.  \"Wait, wait,\" said the frog.  \"Take\nme with you.  I can't run as you can.\"  But what did it avail him to\nscream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could.  She did\nnot listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was\nforced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the king and\nall the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate,\nsomething came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble\nstaircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and\ncried, \"Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.\"  She ran to\nsee who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog\nin front of it.  Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat\ndown to dinner again, and was quite frightened.  The king saw plainly\nthat her heart was beating violently, and said, \"My child, what are\nyou so afraid of?  Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to\ncarry you away?\"  \"Ah, no,\" replied she.  \"It is no giant but a disgusting\nfrog.\"\n\n\"What does a frog want with you?\"  \"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was\nin the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into\nthe water.  And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for\nme, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my\ncompanion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his\nwater.  And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.\"\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,  \"Princess,\nyoungest princess,  open the door for me,  do you not know what you\nsaid to me yesterday by the cool waters of the well.  Princess,\nyoungest princess,  open the door for me.\"\n\nThen said the king, \"That which you have promised must you perform.\nGo and let him in.\"  She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped\nin and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and\ncried, \"Lift me up beside you.\"  She delayed, until at last the king\ncommanded her to do it.  Once the frog was on the chair he wanted to\nbe on the table, and when he was on the table he said, \"Now, push your\nlittle golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.\"  She did\nthis, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly.  The\nfrog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked\nher.  At length he said, \"I have eaten and am satisfied, now I am\ntired, carry me into your little room and make your little silken bed\nready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nThe king's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog\nwhich she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her\npretty, clean little bed.  But the king grew angry and said, \"He who\nhelped you when you were in trouble ought not afterwards to be\ndespised by you.\"  So she took hold of the frog with two fingers,\ncarried him upstairs, and put him in a corner, but when she was in\nbed he crept to her and said, \"I am tired, I want to sleep as well as\nyou, lift me up or I will tell your father.\"  At this she was terribly\nangry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the\nwall.  \"Now, will you be quiet, odious frog,\" said she.  But when he\nfell down he was no frog but a king's son with kind and beautiful\neyes.  He by her father's will was now her dear companion and\nhusband.  Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked\nwitch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but\nherself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom.\n\nThen they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a\ncarriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white\nostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden\nchains, and behind stood the young king's servant Faithful Henry.\nFaithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a\nfrog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart,\nlest it should burst with grief and sadness.  The carriage was to\nconduct the young king into his kingdom.  Faithful Henry helped them\nboth in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because\nof this deliverance.  And when they had driven a part of the way the\nking's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken.\nSo he turned round and cried, \"Henry, the carriage is breaking.\"\n\"No, master, it is not the carriage.  It is a band from my heart,\nwhich was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and\nimprisoned in the well.\"  Again and once again while they were on\ntheir way something cracked, and each time the king's son thought the\ncarriage was breaking, but it was only the bands which were springing\nfrom the heart of Faithful Henry because his master was set free and\nwas happy.\n", "Our Lady's Child": "Hard by a great forest dwelt a wood-cutter with his wife, who had an\nonly child, a little girl three years old.  They were so poor,\nhowever, that they no longer had daily bread, and did not know how to\nget food for her.  One morning the wood-cutter went out sorrowfully\nto his work in the forest, and while he was cutting wood, suddenly\nthere stood before him a tall and beautiful woman with a crown of\nshining stars on her head, who said to him 'I am the virgin mary,\nmother of the child jesus. You are poor and needy, bring your child\nto me, I will take her with me and be her mother, and care for her.'\nThe wood-cutter obeyed, brought his child, and gave her to the virgin\nmary, who took her up to heaven with her.  There the child fared\nwell, ate sugar-cakes, and drank sweet milk, and her clothes were of\ngold, and the little angels played with her.  And when she was\nfourteen years of age, the virgin mary called her one day and said\n'dear child, I am about to make a long journey, so take into your\nkeeping the keys of the thirteen doors of heaven.  Twelve of these\nyou may open, and behold the glory which is within them, but the\nthirteenth, to which this little key belongs, is forbidden you.  Take\ncare not to open it, or you will be unhappy.' The girl promised to be\nobedient, and when the virgin mary was gone, she began to examine the\ndwellings of the kingdom of heaven.  Each day she opened one of them,\nuntil she had made the round of the twelve. In each of them sat one\nof the apostles in the midst of a great light, and she rejoiced in\nall the magnificence and splendor, and the little angels who always\naccompanied her rejoiced with her. Then the forbidden door alone\nremained, and she felt a great desire to know what could be hidden\nbehind it, and said to the angels 'I will not open it entirely, and I\nwill not go inside, but I will unlock it so that we can see just a\nlittle through the opening.' 'Oh'no,  said the little angels,  'that\nwould be a sin.  The virgin mary has forbidden it, and it might\neasily cause your unhappiness.' Then she was silent, but the desire\nin her heart was not stilled, but gnawed there and tormented her, and\nlet her have no rest.  And once when the angels had all gone out, she\nthought 'now I am quite alone, and I could peep in.  If I do, no one\nwill ever know.' She sought out the key, and when she had got it in\nher hand, she put it in the lock, and when she had put it in, she\nturned it round as well.  Then the door sprang open, and she saw\nthere the trinity sitting in fire and splendor.  She stayed there\nawhile, and looked at everything in amazement, then she touched the\nlight a little with her finger, and her finger became quite golden.\nImmediately a great fear fell on her.  She shut the door violently,\nand ran hi there.  But her terror would not quit her, let her do what she\n'Yes,  said the girl, for the second time. Then she perceived the\nfinger which had become golden from touching the fire of heaven, and\nsaw well that the child had sinned, and said for the third time 'have\nyou not done it.' 'No,  said the girl for the third time.  Then said\nthe virgin mary 'you have not obeyed me, and besides that you have\nlied, you are no longer worthy to be in heaven.' Then the girl fell\ninto a deep sleep, and when she awoke she lay on the earth below, and\nin the midst of a wilderness.  She wanted to cry out, but she could\nbring forth no sound.  She sprang up and wanted to run away, but\nwhithersoever she turned herself, she was continually held back by\nthick hedges of thorns through which she could not break.  In the\ndesert, in which she was imprisoned, there stood an old hollow tree,\nand this had to be her dwelling-place.  Into this she crept when\nnight came, and here she slept.  Here, too, she found a shelter from\nmight, and her heart beat continually and would not be still, the gold too\nstayed on her finger, and  would not go away, let  her rub it and wash  it\nnever so much. It was not long  before the virgin mary came back from  her\njourney.  She called the girl  before her, and asked  to have the keys  of\nheaven back.  When the maiden gave  her the bunch, the virgin looked  into\nher eyes and said 'have you not opened the thirteenth door also.' 'No, she\nreplied.  Then she laid her hand on the girl's heart, and felt how it beat\nand beat, and  saw right well  that she  had disobeyed her  order and  had\nopened the door.  Then she said once again 'are you certain that you  have\nnot done it.'\nstorm and rain, but it was a miserable life, and bitterly did she\nweep when she remembered how happy she had been in heaven, and how\nthe angels had played with her.  Roots and wild berries were her only\nfood, and for these she sought as far as she could go.  In the autumn\nshe picked up the fallen nuts and leaves, and carried them into the\nhole.  The nuts were her food in winter, and when snow and ice came,\nshe crept amongst the leaves like a poor little animal that she might\nnot freeze.  Before long her clothes were all torn, and one bit of\nthem after another fell off her.  As soon, however, as the sun shone\nwarm again, she went out and sat in front of the tree, and her long\nhair covered her on all sides like a mantle.  Thus she sat year after\nyear, and felt the pain and the misery of the world. One day, when\nthe trees were once more clothed in fresh green, the king of the\ncountry was hunting in the forest, and followed a roe, and as it had\nfled into the thicket which shut in this part of the forest, he got\noff his horse, tore the bushes asunder, and cut himself a path with\nhis sword.  When he had at last forced his way through, he saw a\nwonderfully beautiful maiden sitting under the tree, and she sat\nthere and was entirely covered with her golden hair down to her very\nfeet. He stood still and looked at her full of surprise, then he\nspoke to her and said 'who are you.  Why are you sitting here in the\nwilderness.' But she gave no answer, for she could not open her\nmouth.  The king continued 'will you go with me to my castle.  Then\nshe just nodded her head a little.  The king took her in his arms,\ncarried her to his horse, and rode home with her, and when he reached\nthe royal castle he caused her to be dressed in beautiful garments,\nand gave her all things in abundance.  Although she could not speak,\nshe was still so beautiful and charming that he began to love her\nwith all his heart, and it was not long before he married her. After\na year or so had passed, the queen brought a son into the world.\nThereupon the virgin mary appeared to her in the night when she lay\nin her bed alone, and said 'if you will tell the truth and confess\nthat you did unlock the forbidden door, I will open your mouth and\ngive you back your speech, but if you persevere in your sin, and deny\nobstinately, I will take your new-born child away with me.' The the\nqueen was permitted to answer, but she remained hard, and said 'no, I\ndid not open the forbidden door, and the virgin mary took the\nnew-born child from her arms, and vanished with it.  Next morning\nwhen the child was not to be found, it was whispered among the people\nthat the queen was a man-eater, and had put her own child to death.\nShe heard all this and could say nothing to the contrary, but the\nking would not believe it, for he loved her so much. When a year had\ngone by the queen again bore a son, and in the night the virgin mary\nagain came to her, and said 'if you will confess that you opened the\nforbidden door, I will give you your child back and untie your tongue\nbut if you continue in sin and deny it, I will take away with me this\nnew child also.' Then the queen again said 'no, I did not open the\nforbidden door.' And the virgin took the child out of her arms, and\naway with her to heaven.  Next morning, when this child also had\ndisappeared, the people declared quite loudly that the queen had\ndevoured it, and the king's councillors demanded that she should be\nbrought to justice.  The king however, loved her so dearly that he\nwould not believe it, and commanded the councillors under pain of\ndeath not to say any more about it. The following year the queen gave\nbirth to a beautiful little daughter, and for the third time the\nvirgin mary appeared to her in the night and said 'follow me.' She\ntook the queen by the hand and led her to heaven, and showed her\nthere her two eldest children, who smiled at her, and were playing\nwith the ball of the world.  When the queen rejoiced thereat, the\nvirgin mary said 'is your heart not yet softened.  If you will own\nthat you opened the forbidden door, I will give you back your two\nlittle sons.' But for the third time the queen answered 'no, I did\nnot open the forbidden door.' Then the virgin let her sink down to\nearth once more, and took from her likewise her third child.\n\nNext morning, when the loss was reported abroad, all the people cried\nloudly 'the queen is a man-eater.  She must be judged, and the king\nwas no longer able to restrain his councillors. Thereupon a trial was\nheld, and as she could not answer, and defend herself, she was\ncondemned to be burnt at the stake. The wood was got together, and\nwhen she was fast bound to the stake, and the fire began to burn\nround about her, the hard ice of pride melted, her heart was moved by\nrepentance, and she thought 'if I could but confess before my death\nthat I opened the door.' Then her voice came back to her, and she\ncried out loudly 'yes, mary, I did it, and straight-way rain fell\nfrom the sky and extinguished the flames of fire, and a light broke\nforth above her, and the virgin mary descended with the two little\nsons by her side, and the new-born daughter in her arms.  She spoke\nkindly to her, and said 'he who repents his sin and acknowledges it,\nis forgiven.' Then she gave her the three children, untied her\ntongue, and granted her happiness for her whole life.\n\n", "The Story of a Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was": "A certain father had two sons, the elder of whom was smart and\nsensible, and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and\ncould neither learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him\nthey said 'there's a fellow who will give his father some trouble.'\nWhen anything had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced\nto do it, but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late,\nor in the night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any\nother dismal place, he answered 'oh, no, father, I'll not go there,\nit makes me shudder.' For he was afraid.  Or when stories were told\nby the fire at night which made the flesh creep, the listeners\nsometimes said 'oh, it makes us shudder.' The younger sat in a corner\nand listened with the rest of them, and could not imagine what they\ncould mean.  'They are always saying 'it makes me shudder, it makes\nme shudder,  it does not make me shudder.' Thought he.  'That, too,\nmust be an art of which I understand nothing.'\n\nNow it came to pass that his father said to him one day 'hearken to\nme, you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong,\nand you too must learn something by which you can earn your bread.\nLook how your brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.'\n'Well, father, he replied,  'I am quite willing to learn something -\nindeed, if it could but be managed, I should like to learn how to\nshudder.  I don't understand that at all yet.' The elder brother\nsmiled when he heard that, and thought to himself 'good God, what a\nblockhead that brother of mine is.  He will never be good for\nanything as long as he lives.  He who wants to be a sickle must bend\nhimself betimes.' The father sighed, and answered him 'you shall soon\nlearn what it is to shudder, but you will not earn your bread by\nthat.' Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and\nthe father bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was\nso backward in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing.\n'Just think,  said he,  'when I asked him how he was going to earn\nhis bread, he actually wanted to learn to shudder.' 'If that be all,\nreplied the sexton,  'he can learn that with me.  Send him to me, and\nI will soon polish him.' The father was glad to do it, for he thought\n'it will train the boy a little.' The sexton therefore took him into\nhis house, and he had to ring the church bell.  After a day or two,\nthe sexton awoke him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into\nthe church tower and ring the bell. 'You shall soon learn what\nshuddering is,  thought he, and secretly went there before him, and\nwhen the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round, and was\njust going to take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure\nstanding on the stairs opposite the sounding hole.  'Who is there.'\nCried he, but the figure made no reply, and did not move or stir.\n'Give an answer,  cried the boy,  'or take yourself off, you have no\nbusiness here at night.'\n\nThe sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might\nthink he was a ghost.  The boy cried a second time 'what do you want\nhere. - Speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down\nthe steps.' The sexton thought 'he can't mean to be as bad as his\nwords,  uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone.  Then\nthe boy called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no\npurpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so\nthat it fell down ten steps and remained lying there in a corner.\nThereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went\nto bed, and fell asleep.  The sexton's wife waited a long time for\nher husband, but he did not come back.  At length she became uneasy,\nand wakened the boy, and asked 'do you not know where my husband is.\nHe climbed up the tower before you did.' 'No, I don't know, replied\nthe boy,  'but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the other\nside of the steps, and as he would neither give an answer nor go\naway, I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs.  Just go\nthere and you will see if it was he.  I should be sorry if it were.'\nThe woman ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in\nthe corner, and had broken his leg.\n\nShe carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the\nboy's father.  'Your boy,  cried she,  'has been the cause of a great\nmisfortune.  He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke\nhis leg.  Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.' The\nfather was terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy.  'What\nwicked tricks are these.' Said he,  'the devil must have put them\ninto your head.' 'Father,  he replied, 'do listen to me.  I am quite\ninnocent.  He was standing there by night like one intent on doing\nevil.  I did not know who it was, and I entreated him three times\neither to speak or to go away.' 'Ah,  said the father,  'I have\nnothing but unhappiness with you.  Go out of my sight.  I will see\nyou no more.'\n\n'Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day.  Then will\nI go forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,\nunderstand one art which will support me.' 'Learn what you will,\nspoke the father,  'it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers\nfor you.  Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from\nwhence you come, and who is your father, for I have reason to be\nashamed of you.' 'Yes, father, it shall be as you will.  If you\ndesire nothing more than that, I can easily keep it in mind.'\n\nWhen day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his\npocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to\nhimself 'if I could but shudder.  If I could but shudder.' Then a man\napproached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding\nwith himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they\ncould see the gallows, the man said to him 'look, there is the tree\nwhere seven men have married the ropemaker's daughter, and are now\nlearning how to fly.  Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes,\nand you will soon learn how to shudder.' 'If that is all that is\nwanted, answered the youth,  'it is easily done, but if I learn how\nto shudder as fast as that, you shall have my fifty talers.  Just\ncome back to me early in the morning.' Then the youth went to the\ngallows, sat down beneath it, and waited till evening came. And as he\nwas cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the wind blew so\nsharply that in spite of his fire, he could not get warm.  And as the\nwind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved\nbackwards and forwards, he thought to himself 'if you shiver below by\nthe fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer.' And as he felt\npity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of\nthem after the other, and brought down all seven.  Then he stoked the\nfire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm themselves.  But\nthey sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught their clothes.\nSo he said 'take care, or I will hang you up again.' The dead men,\nhowever, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their rags go\non burning.  At this he grew angry, and said 'if you will not take\ncare, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,  and he hung\nthem up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell\nasleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have\nthe fifty talers, and said 'well, do you know how to shudder.' 'No,\nanswered he,  'how should I know.  Those fellows up there did not\nopen their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags\nwhich they had on their bodies get burnt.' Then the man saw that he\nwould not get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying 'such a\nyouth has never come my way before.' The youth likewise went his way,\nand once more began to mutter to himself 'ah, if I could but shudder.\nAh, if I could but shudder.' A waggoner who was striding behind him\nheard this and asked 'who are you.' 'I don't know, answered the\nyouth.  Then the waggoner asked 'from whence do you come.' 'I know\nnot.' 'Who is your father.' 'That I may not tell you.' 'What is it\nthat you are always muttering between your teeth.' 'Ah, replied the\nyouth,  'I do so wish I could shudder, but no one can teach me how.'\n'Enough of your foolish chatter,  said the waggoner.  'Come, go with\nme, I will see about a place for you.' The youth went with the\nwaggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished\nto pass the night.  Then at the entrance of the parlor the youth\nagain said quite loudly 'if I could but shudder.  If I could but\nshudder.' The host who heard this, laughed and said 'if that is your\ndesire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.' 'Ah, be\nsilent,  said the hostess,  'so many prying persons have already lost\ntheir lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as\nthese should never see the daylight again.' But the youth said\n'however difficult it may be, I will learn it.  For this purpose\nindeed have I journeyed forth.' He let the host have no rest, until\nthe latter told him, that not far from thence stood a haunted castle\nwhere any one could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he\nwould but watch in it for three nights.  The king had promised that\nhe who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was\nthe most beautiful maiden the sun shone on.  Likewise in the castle\nlay great treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these\ntreasures would then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough.\nAlready many men had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come\nout again.  Then the youth went next morning to the king and said 'if\nit be allowed, I will willingly watch three nights in the haunted\ncastle.' The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he\nsaid 'you may ask for three things to take into the castle with you,\nbut they must be things without life.' Then he answered 'then I ask\nfor a fire, a turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.' The\nking had these things carried into the castle for him during the day.\nWhen night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself a\nbright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife\nbeside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe.  'Ah, if I could\nbut shudder.' Said he,  'but I shall not learn it here either.'\nTowards midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing\nit, something cried suddenly from one corner 'au, miau.  How cold we\nare.' 'You fools.' Cried he,  'what are you crying about.  If you are\ncold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.' And when\nhe had said that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap\nand sat down on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with\ntheir fiery eyes.  After a short time, when they had warmed\nthemselves, they said 'comrade, shall we have a game of cards.' 'Why\nnot.' He replied,  'but just show me your paws.' Then they stretched\nout their claws.  'Oh, said he,  'what long nails you have.  Wait, I\nmust first cut them for you.' Thereupon he seized them by the\nthroats, put them on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast.\n'I have looked at your fingers,  said he,  'and my fancy for\ncard-playing has gone, and he struck them dead and threw them out\ninto the water.  But when he had made away with these two, and was\nabout to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and corner\ncame black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more and more\nof them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled horribly,\nand got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put it out.\nHe watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were going\ntoo far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried 'away with you,\nvermin, and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others\nhe killed, and threw out into the fish-pond.  When he came back he\nfanned the embers of his fire again and warmed himself.  And as he\nthus sat, his eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to\nsleep.  Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner.\n'That is the very thing for me,  said he, and got into it.  When he\nwas just going to shut his eyes, however, the bed began to move of\nits own accord, and went over the whole of the castle. 'That's right,\nsaid he,  'but go faster.' Then the bed rolled on as if six horses\nwere harnessed to it, up and down, over thresholds and stairs, but\nsuddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside down, and lay on him like a\nmountain.  But he threw quilts and pillows up in the air, got out and\nsaid 'now any one who likes, may drive, and lay down by his fire, and\nslept till it was day.  In the morning the king came, and when he saw\nhim lying there on the ground, he thought the evil spirits had killed\nhim and he was dead.  Then said he 'after all it is a pity, -- for so\nhandsome a man.' The youth heard it, got up, and said 'it has not\ncome to that yet.' Then the king was astonished, but very glad, and\nasked how he had fared.  'Very well indeed, answered he,  'one night\nis past, the two others will pass likewise.' Then he went to the\ninnkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said 'I never expected\nto see you alive again.  Have you learnt how to shudder yet.' 'No,\nsaid he,  'it is all in vain.  If some one would but tell me.' The\nsecond night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the\nfire, and once more began his old song 'if I could but shudder.' When\nmidnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard, at\nfirst it was low, but it grew louder and louder.  Then it was quiet\nfor a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down\nthe chimney and fell before him.  'Hullo.' Cried he,  'another half\nbelongs to this.  This is not enough.' Then the uproar began again,\nthere was a roaring and howling, and the other half fell down\nlikewise.  'Wait, said he,  'I will just stoke up the fire a little\nfor you.' When he had done that and looked round again, the two\npieces were joined together, and a hideous man was sitting in his\nplace. 'That is no part of our bargain,  said the youth,  'the bench\nis mine.' The man wanted to push him away, the youth, however, would\nnot allow that, but thrust him off with all his strength, and seated\nhimself again in his own place.  Then still more men fell down, one\nafter the other, they brought nine dead men's legs and two skulls,\nand set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The youth also\nwanted to play and said 'listen you, can I join you.' 'Yes, if you\nhave any money.' Money enough, replied he,  'but your balls are not\nquite round.' Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and\nturned them till they were round.  'There, now they will roll\nbetter.' Said he. 'Hurrah.  Now we'll have fun.' He played with them\nand lost some of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything\nvanished from his sight.  He lay down and quietly fell asleep.  Next\nmorning the king came to inquire after him.  'How has it fared with\nyou this time.' Asked he.  'I have been playing at nine-pins,  he\nanswered,  'and have lost a couple of farthings.' 'Have you not\nshuddered then.' 'What.' Said he,  'I have had a wonderful time.  If\nI did but know what it was to shudder.' The third night he sat down\nagain on his bench and said quite sadly 'if I could but shudder.'\nWhen it grew late, six tall men came in and brought a coffin.  Then\nsaid he 'ha, ha, that is certainly my little cousin, who died only a\nfew days ago, and he beckoned with his finger, and cried 'come,\nlittle cousin, come.' They placed the coffin on the ground, but he\nwent to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay therein. He felt\nhis face, but it was cold as ice.  'Wait, said he,  'I will warm you\na little, and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the\ndead man's face, but he remained cold.  Then he took him out, and sat\ndown by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that\nthe blood might circulate again.  As this also did no good, he\nthought to himself 'when two people lie in bed together, they warm\neach other, and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down\nby him.  After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began\nto move. Then said the youth,  'see, little cousin, have I not warmed\nyou.' The dead man, however, got up and cried 'now will I strangle\nyou.' 'What.' Said he,  'is that the way you thank me.  You shall at\nonce go into your coffin again,  and he took him up, threw him into\nit, and shut the lid.  Then came the six men and carried him away\nagain.  'I cannot manage to shudder, said he.  'I shall never learn\nit here as long as I live.' Then a man entered who was taller than\nall others, and looked terrible.  He was old, however, and had a long\nwhite beard. 'You wretch,  cried he,  'you shall soon learn what it\nis to shudder, for you shall die.' 'Not so fast, replied the youth.\n'If I am to die, I shall have to have a say in it.' 'I will soon\nseize you, said the fiend.  'Softly, softly, do not talk so big.  I\nam as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.' 'We shall see,\nsaid the old man.  'If you are stronger, I will let you go - come, we\nwill try.' Then he led him by dark passages to a smith's forge, took\nan axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.  'I can do\nbetter than that, said the youth, and went to the other anvil.  The\nold man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white\nbeard hung down.  Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil with\none blow, and in it caught the old man's beard.  'Now I have you,\nsaid the youth.  'Now it is your turn to die.' Then he seized an iron\nbar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop,\nwhen he would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and\nlet him go.  The old man led him back into the castle, and in a\ncellar showed him three chests full of gold. 'Of these, said he,\n'one part is for the poor, the other for the king, the third yours.'\nIn the meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that\nthe youth stood in darkness.  'I shall still be able to find my way\nout, said he and felt about, found the way into the room, and slept\nthere by his fire.  Next morning the king came and said 'now you must\nhave learnt what shuddering is.' 'No, he answered 'what can it be.\nMy dead cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great\ndeal of money down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.'\n'Then, said the king,  'you have saved the castle, and shall marry my\ndaughter.' 'That is all very well, said he,  'but still I do not know\nwhat it is to shudder.' Then the gold was brought up and the wedding\ncelebrated, but howsoever much the young king loved his wife, and\nhowever happy he was, he still said always 'if I could but shudder -\nif I could but shudder.' And this at last angered her.  Her\nwaiting-maid said 'I will find a cure for him, he shall soon learn\nwhat it is to shudder.  She went out to the stream which flowed\nthrough the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons brought to\nher.\n\nAt night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was to draw the\nclothes off him and empty the bucketful of cold water with the\ngudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would sprawl about\nhim.  Then he woke up and cried 'oh, what makes me shudder so. - What\nmakes me shudder so, dear wife.  Ah. Now I know what it is to\nshudder.'\n\n", "Faithful John": "There was once upon a time an old king who was ill and thought to\nhimself 'I am lying on what must be my deathbed.' Then said he 'tell\nfaithful John to come to me.' Faithful John was his favorite servant,\nand was so called, because he had for his whole life long been so\ntrue to him.  When therefore he came beside the bed, the king said to\nhim 'most faithful John, I feel my end approaching, and have no\nanxiety except about my son.  He is still of tender age, and cannot\nalways know how to guide himself.  If you do not promise me to teach\nhim everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster-father, I\ncannot close my eyes in peace.' Then answered faithful John 'I will\nnot forsake him, and will serve him with fidelity, even if it should\ncost me my life.' At this, the old king said 'now I die in comfort\nand peace.' Then he added 'after my death, you shall show him the\nwhole castle - all the chambers, halls, and vaults, and all the\ntreasures which lie therein, but the last chamber in the long\ngallery, in which is the picture of the princess of the golden\ndwelling, shall you not show.  If he sees that picture, he will fall\nviolently in love with her, and will drop down in a swoon, and go\nthrough great danger for her sake, therefore you must protect him\nfrom that.' And when faithful John had once more given his promise to\nthe old king about this, the king said no more, but laid his head on\nhis pillow, and died.\n\nWhen the old king had been carried to his grave, faithful John told\nthe young king all that he had promised his father on his deathbed,\nand said 'this will I assuredly keep, and will be faithful to you as\nI have been faithful to him, even if it should cost me my life.' When\nthe mourning was over, faithful John said to him 'it is now time that\nyou should see your inheritance.  I will show you your father's\npalace.' Then he took him about everywhere, up and down, and let him\nsee all the riches, and the magnificent apartments, only there was\none room which he did not open, that in which hung the dangerous\npicture.  The picture, however, was so placed that when the door was\nopened you looked straight on it, and it was so admirably painted\nthat it seemed to breathe and live, and there was nothing more\ncharming or more beautiful in the whole world.  The young king\nnoticed, however, that faithful John always walked past this one\ndoor, and said 'why do you never open this one for me.' 'There is\nsomething within it, he replied,  'which would terrify you.' But the\nking answered 'I have seen all the palace, and I want to know what is\nin this room also, and he went and tried to break open the door by\nforce.  Then faithful John held him back and said 'I promised your\nfather before his death that you should not see that which is in this\nchamber, it might bring the greatest misfortune on you and on me.'\n'Ah, no, replied the young king,  'if I do not go in, it will be my\ncertain destruction.  I should have no rest day or night until I had\nseen it with my own eyes.  I shall not leave the place now until you\nhave unlocked the door.'\n\nThen faithful John saw that there was no help for it now, and with a\nheavy heart and many sighs, sought out the key from the great bunch.\nWhen he opened the door, he went in first, and thought by standing\nbefore him he could hide the portrait so that the king should not see\nit in front of him.  But what good was this.  The king stood on\ntip-toe and saw it over his shoulder.  And when he saw the portrait\nof the maiden, which was so magnificent and shone with gold and\nprecious stones, he fell fainting to the ground.  Faithful John took\nhim up, carried him to his bed, and sorrowfully thought 'the\nmisfortune has befallen us, Lord God, what will be the end of it.'\nThen he strengthened him with wine, until he came to himself again.\nThe first words the king said were 'ah, the beautiful portrait.\nWhose it it.' 'That is the princess of the golden dwelling, answered\nfaithful John.  Then the king continued 'my love for her is so great,\nthat if all the leaves on all the trees were tongues, they could not\ndeclare it.  I will give my life to win her.  You are my most\nfaithful John, you must help me.\n\nThe faithful servant considered within himself for a long time how to\nset about the matter, for it was difficult even to obtain a sight of\nthe king's daughter.  At length he thought of a way, and said to the\nking 'everything which she has about her is of gold - tables, chairs,\ndishes, glasses, bowls, and household furniture.  Among your\ntreasures are five tons of gold, let one of the goldsmiths of the\nkingdom fashion these into all manner of vessels and utensils, into\nall kinds of birds, wild beasts and strange animals, such as may\nplease her, and we will go there with them and try our luck.'\n\nThe king ordered all the goldsmiths to be brought to him, and they\nhad to work night and day until at last the most splendid things were\nprepared.  When everything was stowed on board a ship, faithful John\nput on the dress of a merchant, and the king was forced to do the\nsame in order to make himself quite unrecognizable.  Then they sailed\nacross the sea, and sailed on until they came to the town wherein\ndwelt the princess of the golden dwelling.\n\nFaithful John bade the king stay behind on the ship, and wait for\nhim.  'Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me,  said he,\n'therefore see that everything is in order, have the golden vessels\nset out and the whole ship decorated.' Then he gathered together in\nhis apron all kinds of golden things, went on shore and walked\nstraight to the royal palace. When he entered the courtyard of the\npalace, a beautiful girl was standing there by the well with two\ngolden buckets in her hand, drawing water with them.  And when she\nwas just turning round to carry away the sparkling water she saw the\nstranger, and asked who he was.  So he answered 'I am a merchant, and\nopened his apron, and let her look in.  Then she cried 'oh, what\nbeautiful golden things.' And put her pails down and looked at the\ngolden wares one after the other.  Then said the girl 'the princess\nmust see these, she has such great pleasure in golden things, that\nshe will buy all you have.' She took him by the hand and led him\nupstairs, for she was the waiting-maid. When the king's daughter saw\nthe wares, she was quite delighted and said 'they are so beautifully\nworked, that I will buy them all from you.' But faithful John said 'I\nam only the servant of a rich merchant.  The things I have here are\nnot to be compared with those my master has in his ship.  They are\nthe most beautiful and valuable things that have ever been made in\ngold.' When she wanted to have everything brought up to her, he said\n'there are so many of them that it would take a great many days to do\nthat, and so many rooms would be required to exhibit them, that your\nhouse is not big enough.' Then her curiosity and longing were still\nmore excited, until at last she said 'conduct me to the ship, I will\ngo there myself, and behold the treasures of your master.' At this\nfaithful John was quite delighted, and led her to the ship, and when\nthe king saw her, he perceived that her beauty was even greater than\nthe picture had represented it to be, and thought no other than that\nhis heart would burst in twain.  Then she boarded the ship, and the\nking led her within.  Faithful John, however, remained with the\nhelmsman, and ordered the ship to be pushed off, saying 'set all\nsail, till it fly like a bird in the air.' Within, the king showed\nher the golden vessels, every one of them, also the wild beasts and\nstrange animals.  Many hours went by whilst she was seeing\neverything, and in her delight she did not observe that the ship was\nsailing away.  After she had looked at the last, she thanked the\nmerchant and wanted to go home, but when she came to the side of the\nship, she saw that it was on the high seas far from land, and\nhurrying onwards with all sail set.  'Ah,  cried she in her alarm, 'I\nam betrayed.  I am carried away and have fallen into the power of a\nmerchant - I would rather die.' The king, however, seized her hand,\nand said 'I am not a merchant.  I am a king, and of no meaner origin\nthan you are, and if I have carried you away with subtlety, that has\ncome to pass because of my exceeding great love for you.  The first\ntime that I looked on your portrait, I fell fainting to the ground.'\nWhen the princess of the golden dwelling heard this, she was\ncomforted, and her heart was drawn to him, so that she willingly\nconsented to be his wife. It so happened, while they were sailing\nonwards over the deep sea, that faithful John, who was sitting on the\nfore part of the vessel, making music, saw three ravens in the air,\nwhich came flying towards them.  At this he stopped playing and\nlistened to what they were saying to each other, for that he well\nunderstood.  One cried 'oh, there he is carrying home the princess of\nthe golden dwelling.' 'Yes, replied the second,  'but he has not got\nher yet.' Said the third 'but he has got her, she is sitting beside\nhim in the ship.' Then the first began again, and cried 'what good\nwill that do him.  When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap\nforward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he\ndoes that, it will run away with him, and rise up into the air, and\nhe will never see his maiden more.' Spoke the second 'but is there no\nescape.' 'Oh, yes, if someone else mounts it swiftly, and takes out\nthe pistol which he will find in its holster, and shoots the horse\ndead, the young king is saved.  But who knows that. And whosoever\ndoes know it, and tells it to him, will be turned to stone from the\ntoe to the knee.' Then said the second 'I know more than that, even\nif the horse be killed, the young king will still not keep his bride.\nWhen they go into the castle together, a wrought bridal garment will\nbe lying there in a dish, and looking as if it were woven of gold and\nsilver,  it is, however, nothing but sulphur and pitch, and if he put\nit on, it will burn him to the very bone and marrow.' Said the third\n'is there no escape at all.' 'Oh, yes, replied the second,  'if any\none with gloves on seizes the garment and throws it into the fire and\nburns it, the young king will be saved.  But what good will that do.\nWhosoever knows it and tells it to him, half his body will become\nstone from the knee to the heart.' Then said the third 'I know still\nmore, even if the bridal garment be burnt, the young king will still\nnot have his bride. After the wedding, when the dancing begins and\nthe young queen is dancing, she will suddenly turn pale and fall down\nas if dead, and if some one does not lift her up and draw three drops\nof blood from her right breast and spit them out again, she will die.\nBut if any one who knows that were to declare it, he would become\nstone from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot.' When the\nravens had spoken of this together, they flew onwards, and faithful\nJohn had well understood everything, but from that time forth he\nbecame quiet and sad, for if he concealed what he had heard from his\nmaster, the latter would be unfortunate, and if he disclosed it to\nhim, he himself must sacrifice his life.  At length, however, he said\nto himself 'I will save my master, even if it bring destruction on\nmyself.' When therefore they came to shore, all happened as had been\nforetold by the ravens, and a magnificent chestnut horse sprang\nforward.  'Good, said the king,  'he shall carry me to my palace,\nand was about to mount it when faithful John got before him, jumped\nquickly on it, drew the pistol out of the holster, and shot the\nhorse.  Then the other attendants of the king, who were not very fond\nof faithful John, cried 'how shameful to kill the beautiful animal,\nthat was to have carried the king to his palace.' But the king said\n'hold your peace and leave him alone, he is my most faithful John.\nWho knows what good may come of this.' They went into the palace, and\nin the hall there stood a dish, and therein lay the bridal garment\nlooking no otherwise than as if it were made of gold and silver.  The\nyoung king went towards it and was about to take hold of it, but\nfaithful John pushed him away, seized it with gloves on, carried it\nquickly to the fire and burnt it.  The other attendants again began\nto murmur, and said 'behold, now he is even burning the king's bridal\ngarment.' But the young king said 'who knows what good he may have\ndone, leave him alone, he is my most faithful John.' And now the\nwedding was solemnized - the dance began, and the bride also took\npart in it, then faithful John was watchful and looked into her face,\nand suddenly she turned pale and fell to the ground as if she were\ndead.  On this he ran hastily to her, lifted her up and bore her into\na chamber - then he laid her down, and knelt and sucked the three\ndrops of blood from her right breast, and spat them out.  Immediately\nshe breathed again and recovered herself, but the young king had seen\nthis, and being ignorant why faithful John had done it, was angry and\ncried 'throw him into a dungeon.' Next morning faithful John was\ncondemned, and led to the gallows, and when he stood on high, and was\nabout to be executed, he said 'every one who has to die is permitted\nbefore his end to make one last speech, may I too claim the right.'\n'Yes, answered the king,  'it shall be granted unto you.' Then said\nfaithful John 'I am unjustly condemned, and have always been true to\nyou,  and he related how he had hearkened to the conversation of the\nravens when on the sea, and how he had been obliged to do all these\nthings in order to save his master.  Then cried the king 'oh, my most\nfaithful John.  Pardon, pardon - bring him down.' But as faithful\nJohn spoke the last word he had fallen down lifeless and become a\nstone.\n\nThereupon the king and the queen suffered great anguish, and the king\nsaid 'ah, how ill I have requited great fidelity.' And ordered the\nstone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom beside his bed.\nAnd as often as he looked on it he wept and said 'ah, if I could\nbring you to life again, my most faithful John.'\n\nSome time passed and the queen bore twins, two sons who grew fast and\nwere her delight.  Once when the queen was at church and the father\nwas sitting with his two children playing beside him, he looked at\nthe stone figure again, sighed, and full of grief he said 'ah, if I\ncould but bring you to life again, my most faithful John.' Then the\nstone began to speak and said 'you can bring me to life again if you\nwill use for that purpose what is dearest to you.' Then cried the\nking 'I will give everything I have in the world for you.' The stone\ncontinued 'if you will cut off the heads of your two children with\nyour own hand, and sprinkle me with their blood, I shall be restored\nto life.'\n\nThe king was terrified when he heard that he himself must kill his\ndearest children, but he thought of faithful John's great fidelity,\nand how he had died for him, drew his sword, and with his own hand\ncut off the children's heads.  And when he had smeared the stone with\ntheir blood, life returned to it, and faithful John stood once more\nsafe and healthy before him. He said to the king 'your truth shall\nnot go unrewarded, and took the heads of the children, put them on\nagain, and rubbed the wounds with their blood, at which they became\nwhole again immediately, and jumped about, and went on playing as if\nnothing had happened.  Then the king was full of joy, and when he saw\nthe queen coming he hid faithful John and the two children in a great\ncupboard.  When she entered, he said to her 'have you been praying in\nthe church.' 'Yes, answered she, 'but I have constantly been thinking\nof faithful John and what misfortune has befallen him through us.'\nThen said he 'dear wife, we can give him his life again, but it will\ncost us our two little sons, whom we must sacrifice.' The queen\nturned pale, and her heart was full of terror, but she said 'we owe\nit to him, for his great fidelity.' Then the king was rejoiced that\nshe thought as he had thought, and went and opened the cupboard, and\nbrought forth faithful John and the children, and said 'God be\npraised, he is delivered, and we have our little sons again also,\nand told her how everything had occurred.  Then they dwelt together\nin much happiness until their death.\n", "The Good Bargain": "There was once a peasant who had driven his cow to the fair, and sold\nher for seven talers.  On the way home he had to pass a pond, and\nalready from afar he heard the frogs crying, aik, aik, aik, aik.\nWell, said he to himself, they are talking without rhyme or reason,\nit is seven that I have received, not eight. When he got to the\nwater, he cried to them, stupid animals that you are.  Don't you know\nbetter than that.  It is seven thalers and not eight.  The frogs,\nhowever, stuck to their, aik aik, aik, aik.  Come, then, if you won't\nbelieve it, I can count it out to you.  And he took his money out of\nhis pocket and counted out the seven talers, always reckoning four\nand twenty groschen to a taler.  The frogs, however, paid no\nattention to his reckoning, but still cried, aik, aik, aik, aik.\nWhat, cried the peasant, quite angry, if you know better than I,\ncount it yourselves, and threw all the money at them into the water.\nHe stood still and wanted to wait until they were through and had\nreturned to him what was his, but the frogs maintained their opinion\nand cried continually, aik, aik, aik, aik.  And besides that, did not\nthrow the money out again.  He still waited a long while until\nevening came on and he was forced to go home. Then he abused the\nfrogs and cried, you water-splashers, you thick-heads, you\ngoggle-eyes, you have great mouths and can screech till you hurt\none's ears, but you cannot count seven talers.  Do you think I'm\ngoing to stand here till you get through.  And with that he went\naway, but the frogs still cried, aik, aik, aik, aik, after him till\nhe went home sorely vexed. After a while he bought another cow, which\nhe slaughtered, and he made the calculation that if he sold the meat\nwell he might gain as much as the two cows were worth, and have the\nhide into the bargain.  When therefore he got to the town with the\nmeat, a great pack of dogs were gathered together in front of the\ngate, with a large greyhound at the head of them, which jumped at the\nmeat, sniffed at it, and barked, wow, wow, wow.  As there was no\nstopping him, the peasant said to him, yes, yes, I know quite well\nthat you are saying wow, wow, wow, because you want some of the meat,\nbut I should be in a fine state if I were to give it to you.  The\ndog, however, answered nothing but wow, wow.  Will you promise not to\ndevour it all then, and will you go bail for your companions.  Wow,\nwow, wow, said the dog.  Well, if you insist on it, I will leave it\nfor you, I know you well, and know whom you serve, but this I tell\nyou, I must have my money in three days or else it will go ill with\nyou, you can just bring it out to me.  Thereupon he unloaded the meat\nand turned back again.  The dogs fell upon it and loudly barked, wow,\nwow. The countryman, who heard them from afar, said to himself, hark,\nnow they all want some, but the big one is responsible to me for it.\nWhen three days had passed, the countryman thought, to-night my money\nwill be in my pocket, and was quite delighted.  But no one would come\nand pay it.  There is no trusting any one now, said he. At last he\nlost patience, and went into the town to the butcher and demanded his\nmoney.  The butcher thought it was a joke, but the peasant said,\njesting apart, I will have my money.  Did not the big dog bring you\nthe whole of the slaughtered cow three days ago.  Then the butcher\ngrew angry, snatched a broomstick and drove him out.  Wait, said the\npeasant, there is still some justice in the world, and went to the\nroyal palace and begged for an audience.  He was led before the king,\nwho sat there with his daughter, and asked him what injury he had\nsuffered.  Alas, said he, the frogs and the dogs have taken from me\nwhat is mine, and the butcher has paid me for it with the stick.  And\nhe related at full length what had happened.  Thereupon the king's\ndaughter began to laugh heartily, and the king said to him, I cannot\ngive you justice in this, but you shall have my daughter to wife for\nit - in her whole life she has never yet laughed as she has just done\nat you, and I have promised her to him who could make her laugh.  You\nmay thank God for your good fortune. Oh, answered the peasant, I do\nnot want her at all.  I have a wife already, and she is one too many\nfor me, when I go home, it is just as if I had a wife standing in\nevery corner.  Then the king grew angry, and said, you are a boor.\nAh, lord king, replied the peasant, what can you expect from an ox,\nbut beef.  Stop, answered the king, you shall have another reward.\nBe off now, but come back in three days, and then you shall have five\nhundred counted out in full. When the peasant went out by the gate,\nthe sentry said, you have made the king's daughter laugh, so you will\ncertainly receive something good.  Yes, that is what I think,\nanswered the peasant, five hundred are to be counted out to me.\nListen, said the soldier, give me some of it.  What can you do with\nall that money.  As it is you, said the peasant, you shall have two\nhundred,  present yourself in three days, time before the king, and\nlet it be paid to you.  A Jew, who was standing by and had heard the\nconversation, ran after the peasant, held him by the coat, and said,\noh, wonder of God, what a child of fortune you are. I will change it\nfor you, I will change it for you into small coins, what do you want\nwith the great talers.  Jew, said the countryman, three hundred can\nyou still have, give it to me at once in coin, in three days from\nthis, you will be paid for it by the king.  The Jew was delighted\nwith the small profit, and brought the sum in bad groschen, three of\nwhich were worth two good ones. After three days had passed,\naccording to the king's command, the peasant went before the king.\nPull his coat off, said the latter, and he shall have his five\nhundred.  Ah, said the peasant, they no longer belong to me, I\npresented two hundred of them to the sentry, and three hundred the\nJew has changed for me, so by right nothing at all belongs to me.  In\nthe meantime the soldier and the Jew entered and claimed what they\nhad gained from the peasant, and they received the blows strictly\ncounted out.  The soldier bore it patiently and knew already how it\ntasted, but the Jew said sorrowfully, alas, alas, are these the heavy\ntalers.  The king could not help laughing at the peasant, and when\nall his anger was spent, he said, as you have already lost your\nreward before it fell to your lot, I will give you compensation.  Go\ninto my treasure chamber and get some money for yourself, as much as\nyou will.  The peasant did not need to be told twice, and stuffed\ninto his big pockets whatsoever would go in.  Afterwards he went to\nan inn and counted out his money. The Jew had crept after him and\nheard how he muttered to himself, that rogue of a king has cheated me\nafter all, why could he not have given me the money himself, and then\nI should have known what I had.  How can I tell now if what I have\nhad the luck to put in my pockets is right or not.  Good heavens,\nsaid the Jew to himself, that man is speaking disrespectfully of our\nlord the king, I will run and inform, and then I shall get a reward,\nand he will be punished as well. When the king heard of the peasant's\nwords he fell into a passion, and commanded the Jew to go and bring\nthe offender to him.  The Jew ran to the peasant, you are to go at\nonce to the lord king in the very clothes you have on.  I know what's\nright better than that, answered the peasant, I shall have a new coat\nmade first. Do you think that a man with so much money in his pocket\nshould go there in his ragged old coat.  The Jew, as he saw that the\npeasant would not stir without another coat, and as he feared that if\nthe king's anger cooled, he himself would lose his reward, and the\npeasant his punishment, said, I will out of pure friendship lend you\na coat for the short time.  What people will not do for love.  The\npeasant was contented with this, put the Jew's coat on, and went off\nwith him. The king reproached the countryman because of the evil\nspeaking of which the Jew had informed him.  Ah, said the peasant,\nwhat a Jew says is always false - no true word ever comes out of his\nmouth.  That rascal there is capable of maintaining that I have his\ncoat on. What is that, shrieked the Jew, is the coat not mine.  Have\nI not lent it to you out of pure friendship, in order that you might\nappear before the lord king.  When the king heard that, he said, the\nJew has assuredly deceived one or the other of us, either myself or\nthe peasant.  And again he ordered something to be counted out to him\nin hard thalers.  The peasant, however, went home in the good coat,\nwith the good money in his pocket, and said to himself, this time I\nhave made it.\n", "The Twelve Brothers": "There were once upon a time a king and a queen who lived\nhappily together and had twelve children, but they were\nall boys.  Then said the king to his wife, if the thirteenth\nchild which you are about to bring into the world, is a girl, the\ntwelve boys shall die, in order that her possessions may be great,\nand that the kingdom may fall to her alone.  He even caused twelve\ncoffins to be made, which were already filled with shavings, and\nin each lay a little death pillow, and he had them taken into a\nlocked-up room, and then he gave the queen the key of it, and bade\nher not to speak of this to anyone.\n\nThe mother, however, now sat and lamented all day long, until\nthe youngest son, who was always with her, and whom she had\nnamed benjamin, from the bible, said to her, dear mother, why\nare you so sad.\n\nDearest child, she answered, I may not tell you.  But he let\nher have no rest until she went and unlocked the room, and showed\nhim the twelve coffins ready filled with shavings.  Then she said,\nmy dearest benjamin, your father has had these coffins made for\nyou and for your eleven brothers, for if I bring a little girl into\nthe world, you are all to be killed and buried in them.  And as she\nwept while she was saying this, the son comforted her and said, weep\nnot, dear mother, we will save ourselves, and go hence.  But she\nsaid, go forth into the forest with your eleven brothers, and let\none sit constantly on the highest tree which can be found, and keep\nwatch, looking towards the tower here in the castle.  If I give\nbirth to a little son, I will put up a white flag, and then you may\nventure to come back.  But if I bear a daughter, I will hoist a red\nflag, and then fly hence as quickly as you are able, and may the\ngood God protect you.  And every night I will rise up and pray for\nyou - in winter that you may be able to warm yourself at a fire, and\nin summer that you may not faint away in the heat.\n\nAfter she had blessed her sons therefore, they went forth into\nthe forest.  They each kept watch in turn, and sat on the highest\noak and looked towards the tower.  When eleven days had passed\nand the turn came to benjamin, he saw that a flag was being raised.\nIt was, however, not the white, but the blood-red flag which\nannounced that they were all to die.  When the brothers heard that,\nthey were very angry and said, are we all to suffer death for the\nsake of a girl.  We swear that we will avenge ourselves -\nwheresoever we find a girl, her red blood shall flow.\n\nThereupon they went deeper into the forest, and in the midst\nof it, where it was the darkest, they found a little bewitched hut,\nwhich was standing empty.  Then said they, here we will dwell,\nand you benjamin, who are the youngest and weakest, you shall\nstay at home and keep house, we others will go out and fetch food.\n\nThen they went into the forest and shot hares, wild deer, birds and\npigeons, and whatsoever there was to eat.  This they took to\nbenjamin, who had to dress it for them in order that they might\nappease their hunger.  They lived together ten years in the little\nhut, and the time did not appear long to them.\n\nThe little daughter which their mother the queen had given\nbirth to, was now grown up.  She was good of heart, and fair of\nface, and had a golden star on her forehead.  Once, on a great\nwashing, she saw twelve men's shirts among the things, and asked her\nmother, to whom do these twelve shirts belong, for they are far\ntoo small for father.  Then the queen answered with a heavy\nheart, dear child, these belong to your twelve brothers.  Said the\nmaiden, where are my twelve brothers, I have never yet heard\nof them.  She replied, God knows where they are, they are\nwandering about the world.  Then she took the maiden and opened\nthe chamber for her, and showed her the twelve coffins with the\nshavings, and the death pillows.  These coffins, said she,\nwere destined for your brothers, who went away secretly before you\nwere born, and she related to her how everything had happened.\nThen said the maiden, dear mother, weep not, I will go and seek\nmy brothers.\n\nSo she took the twelve shirts and went forth, and straight into\nthe great forest.  She walked the whole day, and in the evening she\ncame to the bewitched hut.  Then she entered it and found a young\nboy, who asked, from whence do you come, and whither are you\nbound, and was astonished that she was so beautiful, and wore\nroyal garments, and had a star on her forehead.  And she answered,\nI am a king's daughter, and am seeking my twelve brothers, and\nI will walk as far as the sky is blue until I find them.  And she\nshowed him the twelve shirts which belonged to them.  Then\nbenjamin saw that she was his sister, and said, I am benjamin, your\nyoungest brother.  And she began to weep for joy, and benjamin\nwept also, and they kissed and embraced each other with the\ngreatest love.  But after this he said, dear sister, there is still\none difficulty.  We have agreed that every maiden whom we meet\nshall die, because we have been obliged to leave our kingdom on\naccount of a girl.  Then said she, I will willingly die, if by so\ndoing I can save my twelve brothers.\n\nNo, answered he, you shall not die.  Seat yourself beneath this\ntub until our eleven brothers come, and then I will soon come to\nan agreement with them.\n\nShe did so, and when it was night the others came from hunting,\nand their dinner was ready.  And as they were sitting at table, and\neating, they asked, what news is there.  Said benjamin, don't\nyou know anything.  No, they answered.  He continued, you have\nbeen in the forest and I have stayed at home, and yet I know\nmore than you do.  Tell us then, they cried.  He answered, but\npromise me that the first maiden who meets us shall not be killed.\n\nYes, they all cried, she shall have mercy, only do tell us.\nThen said he, our sister is here, and he lifted up the tub, and\nthe king's daughter came forth in her royal garments with the\ngolden star on her forehead, and she was beautiful, delicate and\nfair.  Then they were all rejoiced, and fell on her neck, and kissed\nand loved her with all their hearts.\n\nNow she stayed at home with benjamin and helped him with\nthe work.  The eleven went into the forest and caught game, and\ndeer, and birds, and wood-pigeons that they might have food, and\nthe little sister and benjamin took care to make it ready for them.\nShe sought for the wood for cooking and herbs for vegetables, and\nput the pans on the fire so that the dinner was always ready when\nthe eleven came.  She likewise kept order in the little house, and\nput beautifully white clean coverings on the little beds and the\nbrothers were always contented and lived in great harmony with her.\n\nOnce upon a time the two at home had prepared a wonderful\nfeast, and when they were all together, they sat down and ate and\ndrank and were full of gladness.  There was, however, a little\ngarden belonging to the bewitched house wherein stood twelve lily\nflowers, which are likewise called student-lilies.  She wished to\ngive her brothers pleasure, and plucked the twelve flowers, and\nthought she would present each brother with one while at dinner.\nBut at the self-same moment that she plucked the flowers the twelve\nbrothers were changed into twelve ravens, and flew away over the\nforest, and the house and garden vanished likewise.  And now the\npoor maiden was alone in the wild forest, and when she looked\naround, an old woman was standing near her who said, my child,\nwhat have you done.  Why did you not leave the twelve white\nflowers growing.  They were your brothers, who are now forevermore\nchanged into ravens.  The maiden said, weeping, is there no way of\nsaving them.\n\nNo, said the woman, there is but one in the whole world, and\nthat is so hard that you will not save them by it, for you must be\ndumb for seven years, and may not speak or laugh, and if you speak\none single word, and only an hour of the seven years is wanting, all\nis in vain, and your brothers will be killed by the one word.\n\nThen said the maiden in her heart, I know with certainty that\nI shall set my brothers free, and went and sought a high tree and\nseated herself in it and spun, and neither spoke nor laughed.  Now\nit so happened that a king was hunting in the forest, who had a\ngreat greyhound which ran to the tree on which the maiden was\nsitting, and sprang about it, whining, and barking at her.  Then\nthe king came by and saw the beautiful king's daughter with the\ngolden star on her brow, and was so charmed with her beauty that\nhe called to ask her if she would be his wife.  She made no answer,\nbut nodded a little with her head.  So he climbed up the tree\nhimself, carried her down, placed her on his horse, and bore her\nhome.  Then the wedding was solemnized with great magnificence and\nrejoicing, but the bride neither spoke nor smiled.  When they had\nlived happily together for a few years, the king's mother, who was\na wicked woman, began to slander the young queen, and said to\nthe king, this is a common beggar girl whom you have brought\nback with you.  Who knows what wicked tricks she practises secretly.\nEven if she be dumb, and not able to speak, she still might\nlaugh for once.  But those who do not laugh have bad consciences.\n\nAt first the king would not believe it, but the old woman urged this\nso long, and accused her of so many evil things, that at last the\nking let himself be persuaded and sentenced her to death.\nAnd now a great fire was lighted in the courtyard in which she\nwas to be burnt, and the king stood above at the window and\nlooked on with tearful eyes, because he still loved her so much.\nAnd when she was bound fast to the stake, and the fire was licking\nat her clothes with its red tongue, the last instant of the seven\nyears expired.  Then a whirring sound was heard in the air, and\ntwelve ravens came flying towards the place, and sank downwards, and\nwhen they touched the earth they were her twelve brothers, whom\nshe had saved.  They tore the fire asunder, extinguished the flames,\nset their dear sister free, and kissed and embraced her.  And now\nas she dared to open her mouth and speak, she told the king why she\nhad been dumb, and had never laughed.  The king rejoiced when\nhe heard that she was innocent, and they all lived in great unity\nuntil their death.  The wicked step-mother was taken before the\njudge, and put into a barrel filled with boiling oil and venomous\nsnakes, and died an evil death.\n", "Brother and Sister": "Little brother took his little sister by the hand and said, since\nour mother died we have had no happiness.  Our step-mother\nbeats us every day, and if we come near her she kicks us away\nwith her foot.  Our meals are the hard crusts of bread that are left\nover.  And the little dog under the table is better off, for she\noften throws it a choice morsel.  God pity us, if our mother only\nknew.  Come, we will go forth together into the wide world.\n\nThey walked the whole day over meadows, fields, and stony\nplaces.  And when it rained the little sister said, heaven and our\nhearts are weeping together.  In the evening they came to a large\nforest, and they were so weary with sorrow and hunger and the\nlong walk, that they lay down in a hollow tree and fell asleep.\nThe next day when they awoke, the sun was already high in the\nsky, and shone down hot into the tree.  Then the brother said,\nsister, I am thirsty.  If I knew of a little brook I would go and\njust take a drink.  I think I hear one running.  The brother got up\nand took the little sister by the hand, and they set off to find\nthe brook.  But the wicked step-mother was a witch, and had seen how\nthe two children had gone away, and had crept after them secretly,\nas witches creep, and had bewitched all the brooks in the forest.\n\nNow when they found a little brook leaping brightly over the\nstones, the brother was going to drink out of it, but the sister\nheard how it said as it ran, who drinks of me will be a tiger.\nWho drinks of me will be a tiger.  Then the sister cried, pray,\ndear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and\ntear me to pieces.  The brother did not drink, although he was so\nthirsty, but said, I will wait for the next spring.\n\nWhen they came to the next brook the sister heard this also say,\nwho drinks of me will be a wolf.  Who drinks of me will be a wolf.\nThen the sister cried out, pray, dear brother, do not drink,\nor you will become a wolf, and devour me.  The brother did not\ndrink, and said, I will wait until we come to the next spring, but\nthen I must drink, say what you like.  For my thirst is too great.\nAnd when they came to the third brook the sister heard how it\nsaid as it ran, who drinks of me will be a roebuck.  Who drinks\nof me will be a roebuck.  The sister said, oh, I pray you, dear\nbrother, do not drink, or you will become a roebuck, and run away\nfrom me.  But the brother had knelt down at once by the brook,\nand had bent down and drunk some of the water, and as soon as\nthe first drops touched his lips he lay there in the form of a\nyoung roebuck.\n\nAnd now the sister wept over her poor bewitched brother, and\nthe little roe wept also, and sat sorrowfully near to her.  But at\nlast the girl said, be quiet, dear little roe, I will never,\nnever leave you.\n\nThen she untied her golden garter and put it round the roebuck's\nneck, and she plucked rushes and wove them into a soft cord.  This\nshe tied to the little animal and led it on, and she walked deeper\nand deeper into the forest.\n\nAnd when they had gone a very long way they came at last to a\nlittle house, and the girl looked in.  And as it was empty, she\nthought, we can stay here and live.  Then she sought for leaves\nand moss to make a soft bed for the roe.  And every morning she\nwent out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself, and\nbrought tender grass for the roe, who ate out of her hand, and was\ncontent and played round about her.  In the evening, when the sister\nwas tired, and had said her prayer, she laid her head upon the\nroebuck's back - that was her pillow, and she slept softly on it.\nAnd if only the brother had had his human form it would have been a\ndelightful life.\nFor some time they were alone like this in the wilderness.  But\nit happened that the king of the country held a great hunt in the\nforest.  Then the blasts of the horns, the barking of dogs and the\nmerry shouts of the huntsmen rang through the trees, and the roebuck\nheard all, and was only too anxious to be there.  Oh, said he,\nto his sister, let me be off to the hunt, I cannot bear it any\nlonger, and he begged so much that at last she agreed.  But, said\nshe to him, come back to me in the evening.  I must shut my door for\nfear of the rough huntsmen, so knock and say, my little sister,\nlet me in, that I may know you.  And if you do not say that, I\nshall not open the door.  Then the young roebuck sprang away.  So\nhappy was he and so merry in the open air.\nThe king and the huntsmen saw the lovely animal, and started\nafter him, but they could not catch him, and when they thought\nthat they surely had him, away he sprang through the bushes and\nvanished.  When it was dark he ran to the cottage, knocked, and\nsaid, my little sister, let me in.  Then the door was opened for\nhim, and he jumped in, and rested himself the whole night through\nupon his soft bed.\nThe next day the hunt began again, and when the roebuck once\nmore heard the bugle-horn, and the ho. Ho. Of the huntsmen, he\nhad no peace, but said, sister, let me out, I must be off.  His\nsister opened the door for him, and said, but you must be here again\nin the evening and say your pass-word.\nWhen the king and his huntsmen again saw the young roebuck\nwith the golden collar, they all chased him, but he was too quick\nand nimble for them.  This lasted the whole day, but by the evening\nthe huntsmen had surrounded him, and one of them wounded him\na little in the foot, so that he limped and ran slowly.  Then a\nhunter crept after him to the cottage and heard how he said, my\nlittle sister, let me in, and saw that the door was opened for him,\nand was shut again at once.  The huntsman took notice of it all, and\nwent to the king and told him what he had seen and heard.  Then\nthe king said, to-morrow we will hunt once more.\nThe little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she\nsaw that her fawn was hurt.  She washed the blood off him, laid\nherbs on the wound, and said, go to your bed, dear roe, that you\nmay get well again.  But the wound was so slight that the roebuck,\nnext morning, did not feel it any more.  And when he again heard\nthe sport outside, he said, I cannot bear it, I must be there.\nThey shall not find it so easy to catch me.  The sister cried, and\nsaid, this time they will kill you, and here am I alone in the\nforest and forsaken by all the world.  I will not let you out.  Then\nyou will have me die of grief, answered the roe.  When I hear the\nbugle-horns I feel as if I must jump out of my skin.  Then the\nsister could not do otherwise, but opened the door for him with a\nheavy heart, and the roebuck, full of health and joy, bounded into\nthe forest.\nWhen the king saw him, he said to his huntsmen, now chase\nhim all day long till night-fall, but take care that no one does him\nany harm.\nAs soon as the sun had set, the king said to the huntsman, now\ncome and show me the cottage in the wood.  And when he was at\nthe door, he knocked and called out, dear little sister, let me in.\nThen the door opened, and the king walked in, and there stood\na maiden more lovely than any he had ever seen.  The maiden was\nfrightened when she saw, not her little roe, but a man come in who\nwore a golden crown upon his head.  But the king looked kindly\nat her, stretched out his hand, and said, will you go with me to\nmy palace and be my dear wife.  Yes, indeed, answered the\nmaiden, but the little roe must go with me, I cannot leave him.\nThe king said, it shall stay with you as long as you live, and\nshall want nothing.  Just then he came running in, and the sister\nagain tied him with the cord of rushes, took it in her own hand, and\nwent away with the king from the cottage.\nThe king took the lovely maiden upon his horse and carried\nher to his palace, where the wedding was held with great pomp.\nShe was now the queen, and they lived for a long time happily\ntogether.  The roebuck was tended and cherished, and ran about in\nthe palace-garden.\n But the wicked step-mother, because of whom the children had\ngone out into the world, had never thought but that the sister had\nbeen torn to pieces by the wild beasts in the wood, and that the\nbrother had been shot for a roebuck by the huntsmen.  Now when\nshe heard that they were so happy, and so well off, envy and\njealousy rose in her heart and left her no peace, and she thought of\nnothing but how she could bring them again to misfortune.  Her own\ndaughter, who was ugly as night, and had only one eye, reproached\nher and said, a queen.  That ought to have been my luck.  Just be\nquiet, answered the old woman, and comforted her by saying,\nwhen the time comes I shall be ready.\nAs time went on the queen had a pretty little boy, and it\nhappened that the king was out hunting.  So the old witch took the\nform of the chamber maid, went into the room where the queen\nlay, and said to her, come the bath is ready.  It will do you good,\nand give you fresh strength.  Make haste before it gets cold.\nHer daughter also was close by.  So they carried the weakly\nqueen into the bath-room, and put her into the bath.  Then they\nshut the door and ran away.  But in the bath-room they had made\na fire of such hellish heat that the beautiful young queen was soon\nsuffocated.\nWhen this was done the old woman took her daughter, put a\nnightcap on her head, and laid her in bed in place of the queen.\nShe gave her too the shape and look of the queen, only she\ncould not make good the lost eye.  But in order that the king might\nnot see it, she was to lie on the side on which she had no eye.\nIn the evening when he came home and heard that he had a son\nhe was heartily glad, and was going to the bed of his dear wife to\nsee how she was.  But the old woman quickly called out, for your\nlife leave the curtains closed.  The queen ought not to see the\nlight yet, and must have rest.  The king went away, and did not find\nout that a false queen was lying in the bed.\nBut at midnight, when all slept, the nurse, who was sitting in the\nnursery by the cradle, and who was the only person awake, saw\nthe door open and the true queen walk in.  She took the child out\nof the cradle, laid it on her arm, and suckled it.  Then she shook\nup its pillow, laid the child down again, and covered it with the\nlittle quilt.  And she did not forget the roebuck, but went into the\ncorner where it lay, and stroked its back.  Then she went quite\nsilently out of the door again.  The next morning the nurse asked\nthe guards whether anyone had come into the palace during the night,\nbut they answered, no, we have seen no one.\nShe came thus many nights and never spoke a word.  The nurse\nalways saw her, but she did not dare to tell anyone about it.\nWhen some time had passed in this manner, the queen began to\nspeak in the night, and said,\n     how fares my child, how fares my roe.\n     Twice shall I come, then never more.\nThe nurse did not answer, but when the queen had gone again,\nwent to the king and told him all.   The king said, ah, God.\nWhat is this.  To-morrow night I will watch by the child.  In the\nevening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the queen again\nappeared and said,\n     how fares my child, how fares my roe.\n     Once will I come, then never more.\nAnd she nursed the child as she was wont to do before she\ndisappeared.  The king dared not speak to her, but on the next\nnight he watched again.  Then she said,\n     how fares my child, how fares my roe.\n     This time I come, then never more.\nThen the king could not restrain himself.  He sprang towards her,\nand said, you can be none other than my dear wife.  She answered,\nyes, I am your dear wife, and at the same moment she received\nlife again, and by God's grace became fresh, rosy and full of\nhealth.\nThen she told the king the evil deed which the wicked witch\nand her daughter had been guilty of towards her.  The king ordered\nboth to be led before the judge, and the judgment was delivered\nagainst them.  The daughter was taken into the forest where she was\ntorn to pieces by wild beasts, but the witch was cast into the fire\nand miserably burnt.  And as soon as she was burnt to ashes, the\nroebuck changed his shape, and received his human form again, so the\nsister and brother lived happily together all their lives.\n", "The Three Little Men in the Wood": "There was once a man whose wife died, and a woman whose husband\ndied, and the man had a daughter, and the woman also had a\ndaughter.  The girls were acquainted with each other, and went\nout walking together, and afterwards came to the woman in her\nhouse.  Then said she to the man's daughter, listen, tell your\nfather that I would like to marry him, and then you shall\nwash yourself in milk every morning, and drink wine, but my own\ndaughter shall wash herself in water and drink water.  The girl\nwent home, and told her father what the woman had said.  The\nman said, what shall I do.  Marriage is a joy and also a torment.\nAt length as he could come to no decision, he pulled off his boot,\nand said, take this boot, it has a hole in the sole of it.  Go with\nit up to the loft, hang it on the big nail, and then pour water into\nit.  If it hold the water, then I will again take a wife, but if it\nrun through, I will not.  The girl did as she was bid, but the water\ndrew the hole together and the boot became full to the top.  She\ninformed her father how it had turned out.  Then he himself went up,\nand when he saw that she was right, he went to the widow and wooed\nher, and the wedding was celebrated.\nThe next morning, when the two girls got up, there stood before\nthe man's daughter milk for her to wash in and wine for her to\ndrink, but before the woman's daughter stood water to wash\nherself with and water for drinking.  On the second morning, stood\nwater for washing and water for drinking before the man's\ndaughter as well as before the woman's daughter.  And on the third\nmorning stood water for washing and water for drinking before the\nman's daughter, and milk for washing and wine for drinking, before\nthe woman's daughter, and so it continued.  The woman became her\nstep-daughter's bitterest enemy, and day by day did her best to\ntreat her still worse.  She was also envious because her\nstep-daughter was beautiful and lovable, and her own daughter ugly\nand repulsive.\nOnce, in winter, when everything was frozen as hard as a stone,\nand hill and vale lay covered with snow, the woman made a frock\nof paper, called her step-daughter, and said, here, put on this\ndress and go out into the wood, and fetch me a little basketful of\nstrawberries - I have a fancy for some.  Good heavens, said the\ngirl, no strawberries grow in winter.  The ground is frozen, and\nbesides the snow has covered everything.  And why am I to go in\nthis paper frock.  It is so cold outside that one's very breath\nfreezes.  The wind will blow through the frock, and the thorns\ntear it off my body.  Will you contradict me,  said the step-mother.\nSee that you go, and do not show your face again until you have\nthe basketful of strawberries.  Then she gave her a little piece of\nhard bread, and said, this will last you the day, and thought,\nyou will die of cold and hunger outside, and will never be seen\nagain by me.\nThen the maiden was obedient, and put on the paper frock, and\nwent out with the basket.  Far and wide there was nothing but snow,\nand not a green blade to be seen.  When she got into the wood she\nsaw a small house out of which peeped three little men.  She wished\nthem good day, and knocked modestly at the door.  They cried,\ncome in, and she entered the room and seated herself on the bench by\nthe stove, where she began to warm herself and eat her breakfast.\nThe little men said, give us some of it, too.  Willingly,\nshe said, and divided her piece of bread in two 'and gave\nthem the half.  They asked, what do you here in the forest in the\nwinter time, in your thin dress.  Ah, she answered, I am to look\nfor a basketful of strawberries, and am not to go home until I can\ntake them with me.  When she had eaten her bread, they gave her\na broom and said, sweep away the snow at the back door.  But\nwhen she was outside, the three little men said to each other, what\nshall we give her as she is so good, and has shared her bread with\nus.  Then said the first, my gift is, that she shall every day grow\nmore beautiful.  The second said, my gift is, that gold pieces shall\nfall out of her mouth every time she speaks.  The third said, my\ngift is, that a king shall come and take her to wife.\nThe girl, however, did as the little men had bidden\nher, swept away the snow behind the little house with\nthe broom, and what did she find but real ripe strawberries,\nwhich came up quite dark-red out of the snow.  In her\njoy she hastily gathered her basket full, thanked the\nlittle men, shook hands with each of them, and ran\nhome to take her step-mother what she had longed for so much.\nWhen she went in and said good-evening, a piece of gold at once\nfell out of her mouth.  Thereupon she related what had happened\nto her in the wood, but with every word she spoke, gold pieces fell\nfrom her mouth, until very soon the whole room was covered with\nthem.  Now look at her arrogance, cried the step-sister, to throw\nabout gold in that way.  But she was secretly envious of it, and\nwanted to go into the forest also to seek strawberries.  The mother\nsaid, no, my dear little daughter, it is too cold, you might freeze\nto death.  However, as her daughter let her have no peace, the\nmother at last yielded, made her a magnificent coat of fur, which\nshe was obliged to put on, and gave her bread-and-butter and cake\nfor her journey.\nThe girl went into the forest and straight up to the little house.\nThe three little men peeped out again, but she did not greet them,\nand without looking round at them and without speaking to them,\nshe went awkwardly into the room, seated herself by the stove, and\nbegan to eat her bread-and-butter and cake.  Give us some of it,\ncried the little men.  But she replied, there is not enough for\nmyself, so how can I give it away to other people.  When she had\nfinished eating, they said, there is a broom for you, sweep it all\nclean in front of the back-door.  Sweep for yourselves, she\nanswered, I am not your servant.  When she saw that they were\nnot going to give her anything, she went out by the door.  Then the\nlittle men said to each other, what shall we give her as she is so\nnaughty, and has a wicked envious heart, that will never let her do\na good turn to any one.  The first said, I grant that she may grow\nuglier every day.  The second said, I grant that at every word she\nsays, a toad shall spring out of her mouth.  The third said, I grant\nthat she may die a miserable death.  The maiden looked for\nstrawberries outside, but as she found none, she went angrily home.\nAnd when she opened her mouth, and was about to tell her mother what\nhad happened to her in the wood, with every word she said, a toad\nsprang out of her mouth, so that everyone was seized with horror\nof her.\nThen the step-mother was still more enraged, and thought of\nnothing but how to do every possible injury to the man's daughter,\nwhose beauty, however, grew daily greater.  At length she took a\ncauldron, set it on the fire, and boiled yarn in it.  When it was\nboiled, she flung it on the poor girl's shoulder, and gave her an\naxe in order that she might go on the frozen river, cut a hole in\nthe ice, and rinse the yarn.  She was obedient, went thither and cut\na hole in the ice.  And while she was in the midst of her cutting, a\nsplendid carriage came driving up, in which sat the king.  The\ncarriage stopped, and the king asked, my child, who are you, and\nwhat are you doing here.  I am a poor girl, and I am rinsing yarn.\nThen the king felt compassion, and when he saw that she was so very\nbeautiful, he said to her, will you go away with me.  Ah, yes, with\nall my heart, she answered, for she was glad to get away from the\nmother and sister.\nSo she got into the carriage and drove away with the king, and\nwhen they arrived at his palace, the wedding was celebrated with\ngreat pomp, as the little men had granted to the maiden.  When a\nyear was over, the young queen bore a son, and as the step-mother\nhad heard of her great good-fortune, she came with her daughter\nto the palace and pretended that she wanted to pay her a visit.\nBut, when the king had gone out, and no one else was present, the\nwicked woman seized the queen by the head, and her daughter\nseized her by the feet, and they lifted her out of the bed, and\nthrew her out of the window into the stream which flowed by.  Then\nthe ugly daughter laid herself in the bed, and the old woman\ncovered her up over her head.  When the king came home again and\nwanted to speak to his wife, the old woman cried, hush, hush, that\ncan't be now, she is lying in a violent sweat.  You must let her\nrest to-day.  The king suspected no evil, and did not come back\nagain till next morning.  And as he talked with his wife and she\nanswered him, with every word a toad leaped out, whereas formerly a\npiece of gold had fallen.  Then he asked what that could be, but the\nold woman said that she had got that from the violent sweat, and\nwould soon lose it again.  During the night, however, the scullion\nsaw a duck come swimming up the gutter, and it said -\n     king, what art thou doing now.\n     Sleepest thou, or wakest thou.\nAnd as he returned no answer, it said -\n     and my guests, what may they do.\nThe scullion said -\n     they are sleeping soundly, too.\nThen it asked again -\n     what does little baby mine.\nHe answered -\n     sleepeth in her cradle fine.\nThen she went upstairs in the form of the queen, nursed the\nbaby, shook up its little bed, covered it over, and then swam away\nagain down the gutter in the shape of a duck.  She came thus for\ntwo nights.  On the third, she said to the scullion, go and tell the\nking to take his sword and swing it three times over me on the\nthreshold.  Then the scullion ran and told this to the king, who\ncame with his sword and swung it thrice over the spirit, and at the\nthird time, his wife stood before him strong, living, and healthy\nas she had been before.  Thereupon the king was full of great joy,\nbut he kept the queen hidden in a chamber until the sunday, when\nthe baby was to be christened.  And when it was christened he said,\nwhat does a person deserve who drags another out of bed and\nthrows him in the water.  The wretch deserves nothing better,\nanswered the old woman, than to be taken and put in a barrel\nstuck full of nails, and rolled down hill into the water.  Then,\nsaid the king, you have pronounced your own sentence.  And he\nordered such a barrel to be brought, and the old woman to be put\ninto it with her daughter, and then the top was hammered on, and\nthe barrel rolled down hill until it went into the river.\n", "The Three Spinners": "There was once a girl who was idle and would not spin, and\nlet her mother say what she would, she could not bring her\nto it.  At last the mother was once so overcome with anger\nand impatience, that she beat her, at which the girl began\nto weep loudly.  Now at this very moment the queen drove by,\nand when she heard the weeping she stopped her carriage, went\ninto the house and asked the mother why she was beating her\ndaughter so that the cries could be heard out on the road.  Then\nthe woman was ashamed to reveal the laziness of her daughter\nand said, I cannot get her to leave off spinning.  She insists\non spinning for ever and ever, and I am poor, and cannot\nprocure the flax.  Then\nanswered the queen, there is nothing that I like better to hear\nthan spinning, and I am never happier than when the wheels are\nhumming.  Let me have your daughter with me in the palace.  I\nhave flax enough, and there she shall spin as much as she likes.\nThe mother was heartily satisfied with this, and the queen\ntook the girl with her.  When they had arrived at the palace,\nshe led her up into three rooms which were filled from the\nbottom to the top with the finest flax.  Now spin me this flax,\nsaid she, and when you have done it, you shall have my eldest\nson for a husband, even if you are poor.  I care not for that,\nyour untiring industry is dowry enough.  The girl was secretly\nterrified, for she could not have spun the flax, no, not if\nshe had lived till she was three hundred years old, and had\nsat at it every day from morning till night.  When therefore she\nwas alone, she began to weep, and sat thus for three days\nwithout moving a finger.  On the third day came the queen, and\nwhen she saw that nothing had yet been spun, she was surprised,\nbut the girl excused herself by saying that she had not been able\nto begin because of her great distress at leaving her mother's\nhouse.  The queen was satisfied with this, but said when she was\ngoing away, tomorrow you must begin to work.\nWhen the girl was alone again, she did not know what to do, and\nin her distress went to the window.  Then she saw three women\ncoming towards her, the first of whom had a broad flat foot, the\nsecond had such a great underlip that it hung down over her chin,\nand the third had a broad thumb.  They remained standing before\nthe window, looked up, and asked the girl what was amiss with\nher.  She complained of her trouble, and then they offered\nher their help and said, if you will invite us to the wedding,\nnot be ashamed of us, and will call us your aunts, and likewise\nwill place us at your table, we will spin up the flax for you,\nand that in a very short time.  With all my heart, she replied,\ndo but come in and begin the work at once.  Then she let in the\nthree strange women, and cleared a place in the first room,\nwhere they seated themselves and began their spinning.  The one\ndrew the thread and trod the wheel, the other wetted the thread,\nthe third twisted it, and struck the table\nwith her finger, and as often as she struck it, a skein of\nthread fell to the ground that was spun in the finest manner\npossible.  The girl concealed the three spinners from the queen,\nand showed her whenever she came the great quantity of spun\nthread, until the latter could not praise her enough.  When\nthe first room was empty she went to the second, and at last to\nthe third, and that too was quickly cleared.  Then the three women\ntook leave and said to the girl, do not forget what you have\npromised us - it will make your fortune.\nWhen the maiden showed the queen the empty rooms, and the great\nheap of yarn, she gave orders for the wedding, and the bridegroom\nrejoiced that he was to have such a clever and industrious wife,\nand praised her mightily.  I have three aunts, said the girl,\nand as they have been very kind to me, I should not like to\nforget them in my good fortune, allow me to invite them to the\nwedding, and let them sit with us at table.  The queen and the\nbridegroom said, why should we not allow that.  Therefore when\nthe feast began, the three women entered in strange apparel, and\nthe bride said, welcome, dear aunts.  Ah, said the bridegroom,\nhow do you come by these odious friends.  Thereupon he went to\nthe one with the broad flat foot, and said, how do you come by\nsuch a broad foot.  By treading, she answered, by treading.  Then\nthe bridegroom went to the second, and said, how do you come by\nyour falling lip.  By licking, she answered, by licking.  Then\nhe asked the third, how do you come by your broad thumb.  By\ntwisting the thread, she answered, by twisting the thread.  On\nthis the king's son was alarmed and said, neither now nor ever\nshall my beautiful bride touch a spinning-wheel.  And thus she\ngot rid of the hateful flax-spinning.\n", "Hansel and Grethel": "Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife\nand his two children.  The boy was called Hansel and the\ngirl Gretel.  He had little to bite and to break, and once when\ngreat dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily\nbread.  Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and\ntossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, what\nis to become of us.  How are we to feed our poor children, when\nwe no longer have anything even for ourselves.  I'll tell you what,\nhusband, answered the woman, early to-morrow morning we\nwill take the children out into the forest to where it is the\nthickest.  There we will light a fire for them, and give each of\nthem one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and\nleave them alone.  They will not find the way home again, and we\nshall be rid of them.  No, wife, said the man, I will not do that.\nHow can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest.   The wild\nanimals would soon come and tear them to pieces.  O' you fool, said\nshe, then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the\nplanks for our coffins, and she left him no peace until he\nconsented.  But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the\nsame, said the man.\n\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and\nhad heard what their step-mother had said to their father.  Gretel\nwept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, now all is over with us.\nBe quiet, Gretel, said Hansel, do not distress yourself, I will soon\nfind a way to help us.  And when the old folks had fallen asleep,\nhe got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept\noutside.  The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay\nin front of the house glittered like real silver pennies.  Hansel\nstooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he\ncould get in.  Then he went back and said to Gretel, be comforted,\ndear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us, and\nhe lay down again in his bed.  When day dawned, but before the\nsun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying\nget up, you sluggards.  We are going into the forest to fetch\nwood.  She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, there is\nsomething for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you\nwill get nothing else.  Gretel took the bread under her apron, as\nHansel had the pebbles in his pocket.  Then they all set out\ntogether on the way to the forest.  When they had walked a short\ntime, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so\nagain and again.  His father said, Hansel, what are you looking at\nthere and staying behind for.  Pay attention, and do not forget how\nto use your legs.  Ah, father, said Hansel, I am looking at my\nlittle white cat, which is sitting  up on the roof, and wants to say\ngood-bye to me.  The wife said, fool, that is not your little cat,\nthat is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.  Hansel,\nhowever, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been\nconstantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket\non the road.\n\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said,\nnow, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you\nmay not be cold.  Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together,\nas high as a little hill.  The brushwood was lighted, and when the\nflames were burning very high, the woman said, now, children,\nlay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest\nand cut some wood.  When we have done, we will come back and\nfetch you away.\n\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate\na little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the\nwood-axe they believed that their father was near.  It was not the\naxe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree\nwhich the wind was blowing backwards and forwards.  And as they had\nbeen sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and\nthey fell fast asleep.  When at last they awoke, it was already dark\nnight.  Gretel began to cry and said, how are we to get out of the\nforest now.  But Hansel comforted her and said, just wait a little,\nuntil the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.  And\nwhen the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the\nhand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver\npieces, and showed them the way.\n\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came\nonce more to their father's house.  They knocked at the door, and\nwhen the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel,\nshe said, you naughty children, why have you slept so long in the\nforest.  We thought you were never coming back at all.  The father,\nhowever, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them\nbehind alone.\n\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout\nthe land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to\ntheir father, everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left,\nand that is the end.  The children must go, we will take them\nfarther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out\nagain.  There is no other means of saving ourselves.  The man's\nheart was heavy, and he thought, it would be better for you to share\nthe last mouthful with your children.  The woman, however, would\nlisten to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached\nhim.  He who says a must say b, likewise, and as he had yielded the\nfirst time, he had to do so a second time also.\n\nThe children, however, were still awake and had heard the\nconversation.  When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up,\nand wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but\nthe woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out.\nNevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, do not cry,\nGretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of\ntheir beds.  Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was\nstill smaller than the time before.  On the way into the forest\nHansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a\nmorsel on the ground.  Hansel, why do you stop and look round.\nSaid the father, go on.  I am looking back at my little pigeon\nwhich is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,\nanswered Hansel.  Fool.  Said the woman, that is not your little\npigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\nHansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they\nhad never in their lives been before.  Then a great fire was again\nmade, and the mother said, just sit there, you children, and when\nyou are tired you may sleep a little.  We are going into the forest\nto cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and\nfetch you away.  When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of\nbread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way.  Then they\nfell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor\nchildren.  They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel\ncomforted his little sister and said, just wait, Gretel, until the\nmoon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have\nstrewn about, they will show us our way home again.  When the moon\ncame they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands\nof birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all\nup.  Hansel said to Gretel, we shall soon find the way, but they did\nnot find it.  They walked the whole night and all the next day too\nfrom morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\nand were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\nberries, which grew on the ground.  And as they were so weary that\ntheir legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree\nand fell asleep.\n\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father's house.\nThey began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the\nforest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and\nweariness.  When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white\nbird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood\nstill and listened to it.  And when its song was over, it spread its\nwings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they\nreached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted.  And when\nthey approached the little house they saw that it was built of\nbread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear\nsugar.  We will set to work on that, said Hansel, and have a good\nmeal.  I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some\nof the window, it will taste sweet.  Hansel reached up above, and\nbroke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel\nleant against the window and nibbled at the panes.  Then a soft\nvoice cried from the parlor -\n     nibble, nibble, gnaw\n     who is nibbling at my little house.\nThe children answered -\n     the wind, the wind,\n     the heaven-born wind,\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves.  Hansel, who\nliked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and\nGretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and\nenjoyed herself with it.  Suddenly the door opened, and a woman\nas old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came\ncreeping out.  Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that\nthey let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however,\nnodded her head, and said, oh, you dear children, who has brought\nyou here.  Do come in, and stay with me.  No harm shall happen to\nyou.  She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little\nhouse.  Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes,\nwith sugar, apples, and nuts.  Afterwards two pretty little beds\nwere covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down\nin them, and thought they were in heaven.\n\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind.  She was in reality\na wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\nlittle house of bread in order to entice them there.  When a child\nfell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that\nwas a feast day with her.  Witches have red eyes, and cannot see\nfar, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when\nhuman beings draw near.  When Hansel and Gretel came into her\nneighborhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly, I have\nthem, they shall not escape me again.  Early in the morning before\nthe children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both\nof them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy\ncheeks, she muttered to herself, that will be a dainty mouthful.\n\nThen she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried\nhim into a little stable, and locked him in behind a grated door.\nScream as he might, it would not help him.  Then she went to\nGretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, get up, lazy thing,\nfetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is\nin the stable outside, and is to be made fat.  When he is fat, I\nwill eat him.  Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in\nvain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel\ngot nothing but crab-shells.  Every morning the woman crept to the\nlittle stable, and cried, Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may\nfeel if you will soon be fat.  Hansel, however, stretched out a\nlittle bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not\nsee it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that\nthere was no way of fattening him.  When four weeks had gone by,\nand Hansel still remained thin, she was seized with impatience and\nwould not wait any longer.  Now, then, Gretel, she cried to the\ngirl, stir yourself, and bring some water.  Let Hansel be fat or\nlean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.  Ah, how the poor\nlittle sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how\nher tears did flow down her cheeks.  Dear God, do help us, she\ncried.  If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we\nshould at any rate have died together.  Just keep your noise to\nyourself, said the old woman, it won't help you at all.\n\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the\ncauldron with the water, and light the fire.  We will bake first,\nsaid the old woman, I have already heated the oven, and kneaded\nthe dough.  She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which\nflames of fire were already darting.  Creep in, said the witch,\nand see if it properly heated, so that we can put the bread in.\nAnd once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let\nher bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.  But Gretel saw\nwhat she had in mind, and said, I do not know how I am to do it.\nHow do I get in.  Silly goose, said the old woman, the door is big\nenough.  Just look, I can get in myself, and she crept up and\nthrust her head into the oven.  Then Gretel gave her a push that\ndrove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the\nbolt.  Oh.  Then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran\naway, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little\nstable, and cried, Hansel, we are saved.  The old witch is dead.\nThen Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is\nopened.  How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance\nabout and kiss each other.  And as they had no longer any need to\nfear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner\nthere stood chests full of pearls and jewels.  These are far better\nthan pebbles. Said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever\ncould be got in, and Gretel said, I, too, will take something home\nwith me, and filled her pinafore full.  But now we must be off, said\nHansel, that we may get out of the witch's forest.\n\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great\nstretch of water.  We cannot cross, said Hansel, I see no\nfoot-plank, and no bridge.  And there is also no ferry, answered\nGretel, but a white duck is swimming there.  If I ask her, she\nwill help us over.  Then she cried -\n     little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\n     Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee.\n     There's never a plank, or bridge in sight,\n     take us across on thy back so white.\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back,\nand told his sister to sit by him.  No, replied Gretel, that will be\ntoo heavy for the little duck.  She shall take us across, one after\nthe other.  The good little duck did so, and when they were once\nsafely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to\nbe more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from\nafar their father's house.  Then they began to run, rushed into the\nparlor, and threw themselves round their father's neck.  The man\nhad not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the\nforest.  The woman, however, was dead.  Gretel emptied her\npinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and\nHansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to\nthem.  Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in\nperfect happiness.  My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever\ncatches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.\n", "The Three Snake-Leaves": "There was once on a time a poor man, who could no longer\nsupport his only son.  Then said the son, dear father, things go so\nbadly with us that I am a burden to you.  I would\nrather go away and see how I can earn my bread.  So the father gave\nhim his blessing, and with great sorrow took leave of him.  At this\ntime the king of a mighty empire was at war and the youth took\nservice with him, and went out to fight.  And when he came before\nthe enemy, there was a battle, and great danger, and it rained shot\nuntil his comrades fell on all sides, and when the leader also was\nkilled, those left were about to take flight, but the youth stepped\nforth, spoke boldly to them, and cried, we will not let our\nfather-land be ruined.  Then the others followed him, and he pressed\non and conquered the enemy.  When the king heard that he owed the\nvictory to him alone, he raised him above all the others, gave him\ngreat treasures, and made him the first in the kingdom.\n\nThe king had a daughter who was very beautiful, but she was\nalso very strange.  She had made a vow to take no one as her lord\nand husband who did not promise to let himself be buried alive\nwith her if she died first.  If he loves me with all his heart, said\nshe, of what use will life be to him afterwards.  On her side she\nwould do the same, and if he died first, would go down to the grave\nwith him.  This strange oath had up to this time frightened away\nall wooers, but the youth became so charmed with her beauty that\nhe cared for nothing, but asked her father for her.  But do you\nknow what you must promise, said the king.  I must be buried\nwith her, he replied, if I outlive her, but my love is so great that\nI do not mind the danger.  Then the king consented, and the wedding\nwas solemnized with great splendor.\n\nThey lived now for a while happy and contented with each other,\nand then it befell that the young queen was attacked by a severe\nillness, and no physician could save her. And as she lay there dead,\nthe young king remembered what he had been obliged to promise, and\nwas horrified at having to lie down alive in the grave, but there\nwas no escape.  The king had placed sentries at all the gates, and\nit was not possible to avoid his fate.  As the day came when the\ncorpse was to be buried, he was taken down with it into the royal\nvault and then the door was shut and bolted.\n\nNear the coffin stood a table on which were four candles, four\nloaves of bread, and four bottles of wine, and when this provision\ncame to an end, he would have to die of hunger.  And now he sat\nthere full of pain and grief, ate every day only a little piece of\nbread, drank only a mouthful of wine, and nevertheless saw death\ndaily drawing nearer.  Whilst he thus gazed before him, he saw a\nsnake creep out of a corner of the vault and approach the dead body.\nAnd as he thought it came to gnaw at it, he drew his sword and said,\nas long as I live, you shall not touch her, and hewed the snake in\nthree pieces.  After a time a second snake crept out of the hole,\nand when it saw the other lying dead and cut in pieces, it went back,\nbut soon came again with three green leaves in its mouth.  Then it\ntook the three pieces of the snake, laid them together, as they\nfitted, and placed one of the leaves on each wound.  Immediately the\nsevered parts joined themselves together, the snake moved, and\nbecame alive again, and both of them hastened away together.  The\nleaves were left lying on the ground, and a desire came into the\nmind of the unhappy man who had been watching all this, to know\nif the wondrous power of the leaves which had brought the snake\nto life again, could not likewise be of service to a human being.\n\nSo he picked up the leaves and laid one of them on the mouth of his\ndead wife, and the two others on her eyes.  And hardly had he done\nthis than the blood stirred in her veins, rose into her pale face,\nand colored it again.  Then she drew breath, opened her eyes, and\nsaid, ah, God, where am I.  You are with me, dear wife, he answered,\nand told her how everything had happened, and how he\nhad brought her back again to life.  Then he gave her some wine and\nbread, and when she had regained her strength, he raised her up\nand they went to the door and knocked, and called so loudly that\nthe sentries heard it, and told the king.  The king came down\nhimself and opened the door, and there he found both strong and\nwell, and rejoiced with them that now all sorrow was over.  The\nyoung king, however, took the three snake-leaves with him, gave\nthem to a servant and said, keep them for me carefully, and carry\nthem constantly about you.  Who knows in what trouble they may yet\nbe of service to us.\n\nBut a change had taken place in his wife.  After she had been\nrestored to life, it seemed as if all love for her husband had gone\nout of her heart.  After some time, when he wanted to make a voyage\nover the sea, to visit his old father, and they had gone on board a\nship, she forgot the great love and fidelity which he had shown\nher, and which had been the means of rescuing her from death,\nand conceived a wicked inclination for the skipper.  And once when\nthe young king lay there asleep, she called in the skipper and\nseized the sleeper by the head, and the skipper took him by the\nfeet, and thus they threw him down into the sea.  When the\nshameful deed was done, she said, now let us return home, and say\nthat he died on the way.  I will extol and praise you so to my\nfather that he will marry me to you, and make you the heir to his\ncrown.  But the faithful servant who had seen all that they did,\nunseen by them, unfastened a little boat from the ship, got into it,\nsailed after his master, and let the traitors go on their way.  He\nfished up the dead body, and by the help of the three snake-leaves\nwhich he carried about with him, and laid on the eyes and mouth,\nhe fortunately brought the young king back to life.\n\nThey both rowed with all their strength day and night, and their\nlittle boat sailed so swiftly that they reached the old king\nbefore the others.  He was astonished when he saw them come alone,\nand asked what had happened to them.  When he learnt the wickedness\nof his daughter he said, I cannot believe that she has behaved so\nill, but the truth will soon come to light, and bade both go into a\nsecret chamber and keep themselves hidden from everyone.  Soon\nafterwards the great ship came sailing in, and the godless woman\nappeared before her father with a troubled countenance.  He said,\nwhy do you come back alone.  Where is your husband.  Ah, dear\nfather, she replied, I come home again in great grief.  During\nthe voyage, my husband became suddenly ill and died, and if the\ngood skipper had not given me his help, it would have gone ill with\nme.  He was present at his death, and can tell you all.  The king\nsaid, I will make the dead alive again, and opened the chamber,\nand bade the two come out.  When the woman saw her husband, she\nwas thunderstruck, and fell on her knees and begged for mercy.\n\nThe king said, there is no mercy.  He was ready to die with you\nand restored you to life again, but you have murdered him in his\nsleep, and shall receive the reward that you deserve.  Then she was\nplaced with her accomplice in a ship which had been pierced with\nholes, and sent out to sea, where they soon sank amid the waves.\n", "Cinderella": "\tCinderella\nThe wife of a rich man fell sick, and as she felt that her end\nwas drawing near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and\nsaid, dear child, be good and pious, and then the\ngood God will always protect you, and I will look down on you\nfrom heaven and be near you.  Thereupon she closed her eyes and\ndeparted.  Every day the maiden went out to her mother's grave,\nand wept, and she remained pious and good.  When winter came\nthe snow spread a white sheet over the grave, and by the time the\nspring sun had drawn it off again, the man had taken another wife.\nThe woman had brought with her into the house two daughters,\nwho were beautiful and fair of face, but vile and black of heart.\nNow began a bad time for the poor step-child.  Is the stupid goose\nto sit in the parlor with us, they said.  He who wants to eat bread\nmust earn it.  Out with the kitchen-wench.  They took her pretty\nclothes away from her, put an old grey bedgown on her, and gave\nher wooden shoes.  Just look at the proud princess, how decked\nout she is, they cried, and laughed, and led her into the kitchen.\nThere she had to do hard work from morning till night, get up\nbefore daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash.  Besides\nthis, the sisters did her every imaginable injury - they mocked her\nand emptied her peas and lentils into the ashes, so that she was\nforced to sit and pick them out again.  In the evening when she had\nworked till she was weary she had no bed to go to, but had to sleep\nby the hearth in the cinders.  And as on that account she always\nlooked dusty and dirty, they called her cinderella.\nIt happened that the father was once going to the fair, and he\nasked his two step-daughters what he should bring back for them.\nBeautiful dresses, said one, pearls and jewels, said the second.\nAnd you, cinderella, said he, what will you have.  Father\nbreak off for me the first branch which knocks against your hat on\nyour way home.  So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls and jewels\nfor his two step-daughters, and on his way home, as he was riding\nthrough a green thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and\nknocked off his hat.  Then he broke off the branch and took it with\nhim.  When he reached home he gave his step-daughters the things\nwhich they had wished for, and to cinderella he gave the branch\nfrom the hazel-bush.  Cinderella thanked him, went to her mother's\ngrave and planted the branch on it, and wept so much that the tears\nfell down on it and watered it.  And it grew and became a handsome\ntree. Thrice a day cinderella went and sat beneath it, and wept and\nprayed, and a little white bird always came on the tree, and if\ncinderella expressed a wish, the bird threw down to her what she\nhad wished for.\nIt happened, however, that the king gave orders for a festival\nwhich was to last three days, and to which all the beautiful young\ngirls in the country were invited, in order that his son might choose\nhimself a bride.  When the two step-sisters heard that they too were\nto appear among the number, they were delighted, called cinderella\nand said, comb our hair for us, brush our shoes and fasten our\nbuckles, for we are going to the wedding at the king's palace.\nCinderella obeyed, but wept, because she too would have liked to\ngo with them to the dance, and begged her step-mother to allow\nher to do so.  You go, cinderella, said she, covered in dust and\ndirt as you are, and would go to the festival.  You have no clothes\nand shoes, and yet would dance.  As, however, cinderella went on\nasking, the step-mother said at last, I have emptied a dish of\nlentils into the ashes for you, if you have picked them out again in\ntwo hours, you shall go with us.  The maiden went through the\nback-door into the garden, and called, you tame pigeons, you\nturtle-doves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me\nto pick\n     the good into the pot,\n     the bad into the crop.\nThen two white pigeons came in by the kitchen window, and\nafterwards the turtle-doves, and at last all the birds beneath the\nsky, came whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the ashes.\nAnd the pigeons nodded with their heads and began pick, pick,\npick, pick, and the rest began also pick, pick, pick, pick, and\ngathered all the good grains into the dish.  Hardly had one hour\npassed before they had finished, and all flew out again.  Then the\ngirl took the dish to her step-mother, and was glad, and believed\nthat now she would be allowed to go with them to the festival.\nBut the step-mother said, no, cinderella, you have no clothes and\nyou can not dance.  You would only be laughed at.  And as\ncinderella wept at this, the step-mother said, if you can pick two\ndishes of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour, you shall go\nwith us.  And she thought to herself, that she most certainly\ncannot do again.  When the step-mother had emptied the two\ndishes of lentils amongst the ashes, the maiden went through the\nback-door into the garden and cried, you tame pigeons, you\nturtle-doves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me\nto pick\n     the good into the pot,\n     the bad into the crop.\nThen two white pigeons came in by the kitchen-window, and\nafterwards the turtle-doves, and at length all the birds beneath the\nsky, came whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the\nashes.  And the doves nodded with their heads and began pick,\npick, pick, pick, and the others began also pick, pick, pick, pick,\nand gathered all the good seeds into the dishes, and before half an\nhour was over they had already finished, and all flew out again.\nThen the maiden was delighted, and believed that she might now go\nwith them to the wedding.  But the step-mother said, all this will\nnot help.  You cannot go with us, for you have no clothes and can\nnot dance.  We should be ashamed of you.  On this she turned her\nback on cinderella, and hurried away with her two proud daughters.\nAs no one was now at home, cinderella went to her mother's\ngrave beneath the hazel-tree, and cried -\n     shiver and quiver, little tree,\n     silver and gold throw down over me.\nThen the bird threw a gold and silver dress down to her, and\nslippers embroidered with silk and silver.  She put on the dress\nwith all speed, and went to the wedding.  Her step-sisters and the\nstep-mother however did not know her, and thought she must be a\nforeign princess, for she looked so beautiful in the golden dress.\nThey never once thought of cinderella, and believed that she was\nsitting at home in the dirt, picking lentils out of the ashes.  The\nprince approached her, took her by the hand and danced with her.\nHe would dance with no other maiden, and never let loose of her\nhand, and if any one else came to invite her, he said, this is my\npartner.\nShe danced till it was evening, and then she wanted to go home.\nBut the king's son said, I will go with you and bear you company,\nfor he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged.\nShe escaped from him, however, and sprang into the\npigeon-house.  The king's son waited until her father came, and\nthen he told him that the unknown maiden had leapt into the\npigeon-house.  The old man thought, can it be cinderella.  And\nthey had to bring him an axe and a pickaxe that he might hew\nthe pigeon-house to pieces, but no one was inside it.  And when they\ngot home cinderella lay in her dirty clothes among the ashes, and\na dim little oil-lamp was burning on the mantle-piece, for\ncinderella had jumped quickly down from the back of the pigeon-house\nand had run to the little hazel-tree, and there she had taken off\nher beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave, and the bird had\ntaken them away again, and then she had seated herself in the\nkitchen amongst the ashes in her grey gown.\nNext day when the festival began afresh, and her parents and\nthe step-sisters had gone once more, cinderella went to the\nhazel-tree and said -\n     shiver and quiver, my little tree,\n     silver and gold throw down over me.\nThen the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on\nthe preceding day. And when cinderella appeared at the wedding\nin this dress, every one was astonished at her beauty.  The king's\nson had waited until she came, and instantly took her by the hand\nand danced with no one but her.  When others came and invited\nher, he said, this is my partner.  When evening came she wished\nto leave, and the king's son followed her and wanted to see into\nwhich house she went.  But she sprang away from him, and into\nthe garden behind the house.  Therein stood a beautiful tall tree on\nwhich hung the most magnificent pears.  She clambered so nimbly\nbetween the branches like a squirrel that the king's son did not\nknow where she was gone.  He waited until her father came, and\nsaid to him, the unknown maiden has escaped from me, and I\nbelieve she has climbed up the pear-tree.  The father thought,\ncan it be cinderella.  And had an axe brought and cut the\ntree down, but no one was on it.  And when they got into the\nkitchen, cinderella lay there among the ashes, as usual, for she\nhad jumped down on the other side of the tree, had taken the\nbeautiful dress to the bird on the little hazel-tree, and put on her\ngrey gown.\nOn the third day, when the parents and sisters had gone away,\ncinderella went once more to her mother's grave and said to the\nlittle tree -\n     shiver and quiver, my little tree,\n     silver and gold throw down over me.\nAnd now the bird threw down to her a dress which was more\nsplendid and magnificent than any she had yet had, and the\nslippers were golden.  And when she went to the festival in the\ndress, no one knew how to speak for astonishment.  The king's son\ndanced with her only, and if any one invited her to dance, he said\nthis is my partner.\nWhen evening came, cinderella wished to leave, and the king's\nson was anxious to go with her, but she escaped from him so quickly\nthat he could not follow her.  The king's son, however, had\nemployed a ruse, and had caused the whole staircase to be smeared\nwith pitch, and there, when she ran down, had the maiden's left\nslipper remained stuck.  The king's son picked it up, and it was\nsmall and dainty, and all golden.  Next morning, he went with it to\nthe father, and said to him, no one shall be my wife but she whose\nfoot this golden slipper fits.  Then were the two sisters glad,\nfor they had pretty feet.  The eldest went with the shoe into her\nroom and wanted to try it on, and her mother stood by.  But she\ncould not get her big toe into it, and the shoe was too small for\nher.  Then her mother gave her a knife and said, cut the toe off,\nwhen you are queen you will have no more need to go on foot.  The\nmaiden cut the toe off, forced the foot into the shoe, swallowed\nthe pain, and went out to the king's son.  Then he took her on his\nhis horse as his bride and rode away with her.  They were\nobliged, however, to pass the grave, and there, on the hazel-tree,\nsat the two pigeons and cried -\n     turn and peep, turn and peep,\n     there's blood within the shoe,\n     the shoe it is too small for her,\n     the true bride waits for you.\nThen he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was trickling\nfrom it.  He turned his horse round and took the false bride\nhome again, and said she was not the true one, and that the\nother sister was to put the shoe on.  Then this one went into her\nchamber and got her toes safely into the shoe, but her heel was\ntoo large.  So her mother gave her a knife and said,  cut a bit\noff your heel, when you are queen you will have no more need\nto go on foot.  The maiden cut a bit off her heel, forced\nher foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the\nking's son.  He took her on his horse as his bride, and rode away\nwith her, but when they passed by the hazel-tree, the two pigeons\nsat on it and cried -\n     turn and peep, turn and peep,\n     there's blood within the shoe,\n     the shoe it is too small for her,\n     the true bride waits for you.\nHe looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running\nout of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking quite\nred.  Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home\nagain.  This also is not the right one, said he, have you no\nother daughter.  No, said the man, there is still a little\nstunted kitchen-wench which my late wife left behind her, but\nshe cannot possibly be the bride.  The king's son said he was\nto send her up to him, but the mother answered, oh, no, she is\nmuch too dirty, she cannot show herself.  But he absolutely\ninsisted on it, and cinderella had to be called.  She first\nwashed her hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down\nbefore the king's son, who gave her the golden shoe.  Then she\nseated herself on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy\nwooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, which fitted like a\nglove.  And when she rose up and the king's son looked at her\nface he recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with\nhim and cried, that is the true bride.  The step-mother and\nthe two sisters were horrified and became pale with rage, he,\nhowever, took cinderella on his horse and rode away with her.  As\nthey passed by the hazel-tree, the two white doves cried -\n     turn and peep, turn and peep,\n     no blood is in the shoe,\n     the shoe is not too small for her,\n     the true bride rides with you,\nand when they had cried that, the two came flying down and\nplaced themselves on cinderella's shoulders, one on the right,\nthe other on the left, and remained sitting there.\nWhen the wedding with the king's son was to be celebrated, the\ntwo false sisters came and wanted to get into favor with\ncinderella and share her good fortune.  When the betrothed\ncouple went to church, the elder was at the right side and the\nyounger at the left, and the pigeons pecked out one eye from\neach of them.  Afterwards as they came back the elder was at\nthe left, and the younger at the right, and then the pigeons\npecked out the other eye from each.  And thus, for their\nwickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness\nall their days.\n", "The Riddle": "There was once a king's son who was seized with a desire to travel\nabout the world, and took no one with him but a faithful servant.\nOne day he came to a great forest, and when darkness overtook him\nhe could find no shelter, and knew not where to pass the night.\nThen he saw a girl who was going towards a small house, and when\nhe came nearer, he saw that the maiden was young and beautiful.\nHe spoke to her, and said, dear child, can I and my servant find\nshelter for the night in the little house.  Oh, yes, said the\ngirl in a sad voice, that you certainly can, but I do not advise\nyou to venture it.  Do not go in.  Why not, asked the king's son.\nThe maiden sighed and said, my step-mother\npractises wicked arts.  She is ill-disposed toward strangers.\nThen he saw very well that he had come to the house of a witch,\nbut as it was dark, and he could not go farther, and also was\nnot afraid, he entered.  The old woman was sitting in an armchair\nby the fire, and looked at the stranger with her red eyes.  Good\nevening, growled she, and pretended to be quite friendly.  Take\na seat and rest yourselves.  She fanned the fire on which she was\ncooking something in a small pot.  The daughter warned the two to\nbe prudent, to eat nothing, and drink nothing, for the old woman\nbrewed evil drinks.  They slept quietly until early morning.  When\nthey were making ready for their departure, and the king's son was\nalready seated on his horse, the old woman said, stop a moment,\nI will first hand you a parting draught.  Whilst she fetched\nit, the king's son rode away, and the servant who had to buckle\nhis saddle tight, was the only one present when the wicked witch\ncame with the drink.  Take that to your master, said she.  But\nat that instant the glass broke and the poison spirted on the\nhorse, and it was so strong that the animal immediately fell down\ndead.  The servant ran after his master and told him what had\nhappened, but as he did not want to leave his saddle behind, he\nran back to fetch it.  When he came to the dead horse, however,\na raven was already sitting on it devouring it.  Who knows\nwhether we shall find anything better to-day, said the servant.\nSo he killed the raven, and took it with him.  And now they\njourneyed onwards into the forest the whole day, but could not\nget out of it.  By nightfall they found an inn and entered it.\nThe servant gave the raven to the innkeeper to prepare for supper.\nThey had stumbled, however, on a den of murderers, and during\nthe darkness twelve of these came, intending to kill the strangers\nand rob them.  But before they set about this work, they sat down\nto supper, and the innkeeper and the witch sat down with them,\nand together they ate a dish of soup in which was cut up the\nflesh of the raven.  Hardly had they swallowed a couple of\nmouthfuls, before they all fell down dead, for the raven had\ncommunicated to them the poison from the horse-flesh.  There\nwas no no one else left in the house but the innkeeper's daughter,\nwho was\nhonest, and had taken no part in their godless deeds.  She\nopened all doors to the stranger and showed him the store of\ntreasures.  But the king's son said she might keep everything, he\nwould have none of it, and rode onwards with his servant.\nAfter they had traveled about for a long time, they came to a\ntown in which was a beautiful but proud princess, who had made it\nknown that whosoever should set her a riddle which she could\nnot guess, that man should be her husband.  But if she guessed\nit, his head must be cut off.  She had three days to guess it\nin, but was so clever that she always found the answer to the\nriddle given her before the appointed time.  Nine suitors had\nalready perished in this manner, when the king's son arrived, and\nblinded by her great beauty, was willing to stake his life for\nit.  Then he went to her and laid his riddle before her.  What\nis this, said he.  One slew none, and yet slew twelve.  She\ndid not know what that was.  She thought and thought, but she\ncould not solve it.  She opened her riddle-books, but it was\nnot in them - in short, her wisdom was at an end.  As she\ndid not know how to help herself, she ordered her maid to\ncreep into the lord's sleeping-chamber, and listen to his\ndreams, and thought that he would perhaps speak in his sleep\nand reveal the riddle.  But the clever servant had placed\nhimself in the bed instead of his master, and when the maid\ncame there, he tore off from her the mantle in which she had\nwrapped herself, and chased her out with rods.  The second night\nthe king's daughter sent her maid-in-waiting, who was to see\nif she could succeed better in listening, but the servant\ntook her mantle also away from her, and hunted her out with\nrods.  Now the master believed himself safe for the third\nnight, and lay down in his own bed.  Then came the princess\nherself, and she had put on a misty-grey mantle, and she\nseated herself near him.  And when she thought that he was\nasleep and dreaming, she spoke to him, and hoped that he\nwould answer in his sleep, as many do, but he was awake, and\nunderstood and heard everything quite well.  Then she asked,\none slew none, what is that.  He replied, a raven, which\nate of a dead and poisoned horse, and died of it.  She\ninquired further, and yet slew twelve, what is that.  He\nanswered, that means twelve murderers, who ate the raven and died\nof it.\nWhen she knew the answer to the riddle she wanted to steal\naway, but he held her mantle so fast that she was forced to\nleave it behind her.  Next morning, the king's daughter\nannounced that she had guessed the riddle, and sent for the\ntwelve judges and expounded it before them.  But the youth\nbegged for a hearing, and said, she stole into my room in the\nnight and questioned me, otherwise she could not have\ndiscovered it.  The judges said, bring us a proof of this.\nThen were the three mantles brought thither by the servant,\nand when the judges saw the misty-grey one which the king's\ndaughter usually wore, they said, let the mantle be\nembroidered with gold and silver, and then it will be your\nwedding-mantle.\n", "Little Red-Cap": "\tLittle Red-Cap\n\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved\nby every one who looked at her, but most of all by her\ngrandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have\ngiven to the child.  Once she gave her a little cap of red\nvelvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear\nanything else.  So she was always called little red-cap.\n\nOne day her mother said to her, come, little red-cap, here\nis a piece of cake and a bottle of wine.  Take them to your\ngrandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good.\nSet out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk\nnicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may\nfall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\nget nothing.  And when you go into her room, don't forget\nto say, good-morning, and don't peep into every corner before\nyou do it.\n\nI will take great care, said little red-cap to her mother, and\ngave her hand on it.\n\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the\nvillage, and just as little red-cap entered the wood, a wolf\nmet her.  Red-cap did not know what a wicked creature he was,\nand was not at all afraid of him.\n\n\"Good-day, little red-cap,\" said he.\n\n\"Thank you kindly, wolf.\"\n\n\"Whither away so early, little red-cap?\"\n\n\"To my grandmother's.\"\n\n\"What have you got in your apron?\"\n\n\"Cake and wine.  Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick\ngrandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\"\n\n\"Where does your grandmother live, little red-cap?\"\n\n\"A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood.  Her house\nstands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just\nbelow.  You surely must know it,\" replied little red-cap.\n\nThe wolf thought to himself, what a tender young creature.  What a\nnice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old\nwoman.  I must act craftily, so as to catch both.  So he walked\nfor a short time by the side of little red-cap, and then he\nsaid, \"see little red-cap, how pretty the flowers are about here.\nWhy do you not look round.  I believe, too, that you do not\nhear how sweetly the little birds are singing.  You walk gravely\nalong as if you were going to school, while everything else out\nhere in the wood is merry.\"\n\nLittle red-cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams\ndancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers\ngrowing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a\nfresh nosegay.  That would please her too.  It is so early in the\nday that I shall still get there in good time.  And so she ran\nfrom the path into the wood to look for flowers.  And whenever\nshe had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one\nfarther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into\nthe wood.\n\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and\nknocked at the door.\n\n\"Who is there?\"\n\n\"Little red-cap,\" replied the wolf.  \"She is bringing cake and\nwine.  Open the door.\"\n\n\"Lift the latch,\" called out the grandmother, \"I am too weak, and\ncannot get up.\"\n\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without\nsaying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and\ndevoured her.  Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in\nher cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.\n\nLittle red-cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\nand when she had gathered so many that she could carry\nno more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the\nway to her.\n\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and\nwhen she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that\nshe said to herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at\nother times I like being with grandmother so much.  She called\nout, \"good morning,\" but received no answer.  So she went to the\nbed and drew back the curtains.  There lay her grandmother with\nher cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n\n\"Oh, grandmother,\" she said, \"what big ears you have.\"\n\n\"The better to hear you with, my child,\" was the reply.\n\n\"But, grandmother, what big eyes you have,\" she said.\n\n\"The better to see you with,\" my dear.\n\n\"But, grandmother, what large hands you have.\"\n\n\"The better to hug you with.\"\n\n\"Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have.\"\n\n\"The better to eat you with.\"\n\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was\nout of bed and swallowed up red-cap.\n\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in\nthe bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.  The\nhuntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, how\nthe old woman is snoring.  I must just see if she wants anything.\n\nSo he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw\nthat the wolf was lying in it.  Do I find you here, you old\nsinner, said he.  I have long sought you.  Then just as he was going\nto fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\ndevoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so\nhe did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut\nopen the stomach of the sleeping wolf.  When he had made two\nsnips, he saw the little red-cap shining, and then he made two\nsnips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, ah, how\nfrightened I have been.  How dark it was inside the wolf.  And\nafter that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely\nable to breathe.  Red-cap, however, quickly\nfetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and\nwhen he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so\nheavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.\n\nThen all three were delighted.  The huntsman drew off the wolf's\nskin and went home with it.  The grandmother ate the cake and\ndrank the wine which red-cap had brought, and revived, but\nred-cap thought to herself, as long as I live, I will never by\nmyself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has\nforbidden me to do so.\n\nIt is also related that once when red-cap was again taking cakes\nto the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to\nentice her from the path.  Red-cap, however, was on her guard,\nand went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother\nthat she had met the wolf, and that he had said good-morning to\nher, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had\nnot been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten\nher up.  Well, said the grandmother, we will shut the door, that\nhe may not come in.  Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried,\nopen the door, grandmother, I am little red-cap, and am bringing\nyou some cakes.  But they did not speak, or open the door, so\nthe grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last\njumped on the roof, intending to wait until red-cap went home in\nthe evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the\ndarkness.  But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.  In\nfront of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the\nchild, take the pail, red-cap.  I made some sausages yesterday,\nso carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.  Red-cap\ncarried until the great trough was quite full.   Then the smell\nof the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped\ndown, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could\nno longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down\nfrom the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned.\nBut red-cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything\nto harm her again.\n", "The Singing Bone": "In a certain country there was once great lamentation over a\nwild boar that laid waste the farmer's fields, killed the cattle,\nand ripped up people's bodies with his tusks.  The king promised\na large reward to anyone who would free the land from this plague,\nbut the beast was so big and strong that no one dared to go near\nthe forest in which it lived.  At last the king gave notice\nthat whosoever should capture or kill the wild boar should have\nhis only daughter to wife.\n\nNow there lived in the country two brothers, sons of a poor man,\nwho declared themselves willing to undertake the hazardous\nenterprise, the elder, who was crafty and shrewd, out of pride,\nthe younger, who was innocent and simple, from a kind heart.\nThe king said, in order that you may be the more sure of finding\nthe beast, you must go into the forest from opposite sides.  So\nthe elder went in on the west side, and the younger on the east.\nWhen the younger had gone a short way, a little man stepped\nup to him.  He held in his hand a black spear and said, I give\nyou this spear because your heart is pure and good, with this\nyou can boldly attack the wild boar, and it will do you no harm.\nHe thanked the little man, shouldered the spear, and went on\nfearlessly.\n\nBefore long he saw the beast, which rushed at him, but he held\nthe spear towards it, and in its blind fury it ran so swiftly\nagainst it that its heart was cloven in twain.  Then he took the\nmonster on his back and went homewards with it to the king.\nAs he came out at the other side of the wood, there stood at the\nentrance a house where people were making merry with wine and\ndancing.  His elder brother had gone in here, and, thinking that\nafter all the boar would not run away from him, was going to drink\nuntil he felt brave.  But when he saw his young brother coming out\nof the wood laden with his booty, his envious, evil heart gave him\nno peace.  He called out to him, come in, dear brother, rest and\nrefresh yourself with a cup of wine.\n\nThe youth, who suspected no evil, went in and told him about the\ngood little man who had given him the spear wherewith he had slain\nthe boar.\n\nThe elder brother kept him there until the evening, and then they\nwent away together, and when in the darkness they came to a\nbridge over a brook, the elder brother let the other go first, and\nwhen he was half-way across he gave him such a blow from behind\nthat he fell down dead.  He buried him beneath the bridge, took\nthe boar, and carried it to the king, pretending that he had\nkilled it, whereupon he obtained the king's daughter in marriage.\nAnd when his younger brother did not come back he said, the boar\nmust have ripped up his body, and every one believed it.\nBut as nothing remains hidden from God, so this black deed also\nwas to come to light.\n\nYears afterwards a shepherd was driving his herd across the\nbridge, and saw lying in the sand beneath, a snow-white little\nbone.  He thought that it would make a good mouth-piece, so\nhe clambered down, picked it up, and cut out of it a mouth-piece\nfor his horn,  but when he blew through it for the first time,\nto his great astonishment, the bone began of its own accord to\nsing -\n     ah, friend thou blowest upon my bone.\n     Long have I lain beside the water,\n     my brother slew me for the boar,\n     and took for his wife the king's young daughter.\n\nWhat a wonderful horn, said the shepherd, it sings by itself,\nI must take it to my lord the king.  And when he came with it to\nthe king the horn again began to sing its little song.  The\nking understood it all, and caused the ground below the bridge\nto be dug up, and then the whole skeleton of the murdered man\ncame to light.  The wicked brother could not deny the deed, and\nwas sewn up in a sack and drowned.  But the bones of the murdered\nman were laid to rest in a beautiful tomb in the churchyard.\n", "The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs": "There was once a poor woman who gave birth to a little son,\nand as he came into the world with a caul on, it was predicted\nthat in his fourteenth year he would have the king's daughter\nfor his wife.  It happened that soon afterwards the king\ncame into the village, and no one knew that he was the king,\nand when he asked the people what news there was, they answered,\na child has just been born with a caul on, whatever anyone so\nborn undertakes turns out well.  It is prophesied, too, that\nin his fourteenth year he will have the king's daughter for his\nwife.\n\nThe king, who had a bad heart, and was angry about the prophecy,\nwent to the parents, and, seeming quite friendly, said, you poor\npeople, let me have your child, and I will take care of it.  At\nfirst they refused, but when the stranger offered them a large\namount of gold for it, and they thought, it is a child of good\nfortune, and everything must turn out well for it, they at last\nconsented, and gave him the child.\n\nThe king put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to\na deep piece of water, then he threw the box into it and thought,\nI have freed my daughter from her undesired suitor.\n\nThe box, however, did not sink, but floated like a boat, and not\na drop of water made its way into it.  And it floated to within\ntwo miles of the king's chief city, where there was a mill, and\nit came to a halt at the mill-dam.  A miller's boy, who by good\nluck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook,\nthinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened\nit there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively.  He\ntook him to the miller and his wife, and as they had no children\nthey were glad, and said, \"God has given him to us.\"  They took\ngreat care of the foundling, and he grew up in all goodness.\n\nIt happened that once in a storm, the king went into the mill, and\nasked the mill-folk if the tall youth were their son.  No,\nanswered they, he's a foundling.  Fourteen years ago he floated\ndown to the mill-dam in a box, and the mill-boy pulled him out\nof the water.\n\nThen the king knew that it was none other than the child of\ngood fortune which he had thrown into the water, and he said,\nmy good people, could not the youth take a letter to the queen.\nI will give him two gold pieces as a reward.  Just as the king\ncommands, answered they, and they told the boy to hold himself\nin readiness.  Then the king wrote a letter to the queen, wherein\nhe said, as soon as the boy arrives with this letter, let him be\nkilled and buried, and all must be done before I come home.\nThe boy set out with this letter, but he lost his way, and in the\nevening came to a large forest.  In the darkness he saw a small\nlight, he went towards it and reached a cottage.  When he went in,\nan old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone.  She started\nwhen she saw the boy, and said, whence do you come, and whither\nare you going.  I come from the mill, he answered, and wish\nto go to the queen, to whom I am taking a letter, but as I have\nlost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night.\nYou poor boy, said the woman, you have come into a den of thieves,\nand when they come home they will kill you.  Let them come,\nsaid the boy, I am not afraid, but I am so tired that I cannot go\nany farther.  And he stretched himself upon a bench and fell\nasleep.\n\nSoon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange\nboy was lying there.  Ah, said the old woman, it is an innocent\nchild who has lost himself in the forest, and out of pity I have\nlet him come in, he has to take a letter to the queen.  The robbers\nopened the letter and read it, and in it was written that the\nboy as soon as he arrived should be put to death.  Then the\nhardhearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter\nand wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should\nbe married at once to the king's daughter.  Then they let him lie\nquietly on the bench until the next morning, and when he awoke\nthey gave him the letter, and showed him the right way.\n\nAnd the queen, when she had received the letter and read it,\ndid as was written in it, and had a splendid wedding-feast\nprepared, and the king's daughter was married to the child of\ngood fortune, and as the youth was handsome and friendly she lived\nwith him in joy and contentment.\n\nAfter some time the king returned to his palace and saw that\nthe prophecy was fulfilled, and the child married to his daughter.\nHow has that come to pass, said he, I gave quite another order\nin my letter.\n\nSo the queen gave him the letter, and said that he might see for\nhimself what was written in it.  The king read the letter and\nsaw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other.  He\nasked the youth what had become of the letter entrusted to him,\nand why he had brought another instead of it.  I know nothing\nabout it, answered he, it must have been changed in the night,\nwhen I slept in the forest.  The king said in a passion, you shall\nnot have everything quite so much your own way, whosoever marries\nmy daughter must fetch me from hell three golden hairs from\nthe head of the devil, bring me what I want, and you shall keep\nmy daughter.  In this way the king hoped to be rid of him for ever.\nBut the child of good fortune answered, I will fetch the golden\nhairs, I am not afraid of the devil.  Whereupon he took leave of\nthem and began his journey.\n\nThe road led him to a large town, where the watchman by the gates\nasked him what his trade was, and what he knew.  I know\neverything, answered the child of good fortune.  Then you can do us\na favor, said the watchman, if you will tell us why our market\nfountain, which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no\nlonger gives even water.  That you shall know, answered he, only\nwait until I come back.\n\nThen he went farther and came to another town, and there also the\ngatekeeper asked him what was his trade, and what he knew.\nI know everything, answered he.  Then you can do us a favor and\ntell us why a tree in our town which once bore golden apples now\ndoes not even put forth leaves.  You shall know that, answered he,\nonly wait until I come back.\n\nThen he went on and came to a wide river over which he must cross.\nThe ferryman asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.  I\nknow everything, answered he.  Then you can do me a favor, said\nthe ferryman, and tell me why I must always be rowing backwards\nand forwards, and am never set free.  You shall know that,\nanswered he, only wait until I come back.\n\nWhen he had crossed the water he found the entrance to hell.  It\nwas black and sooty within, and the devil was not at home, but\nhis grandmother was sitting in a large arm-chair.  What do you\nwant, said she to him, but she did not look so very wicked.  I\nshould like to have three golden hairs from the devil's head,\nanswered he, else I cannot keep my wife.  That is a good deal\nto ask for, said she, if the devil comes home and finds you, it\nwill cost you your life, but as I pity you, I will see if I cannot\nhelp you.\n\nShe changed him into an ant and said, creep into the folds of my\ndress, you will be safe there.  Yes, answered he, so far, so good,\nbut there are three things besides that I want to know - why a\nfountain which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no\nlonger gives even water, why a tree which once bore golden apples\ndoes not even put forth leaves, and why a ferryman must always be\ngoing backwards and forwards, and is never set free.\nThose are difficult questions, answered she, but just be silent\nand quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when I pull out\nthe three golden hairs.\n\nAs the evening came on, the devil returned home.  No sooner had he\nentered than he noticed that the air was not pure.  I smell man's\nflesh, said he, all is not right here.  Then he pried into\nevery corner, and searched, but could not find anything.  His\ngrandmother scolded him.  It has just been swept, said she, and\neverything put in order, and now you are upsetting it again, you\nhave always got man's flesh in your nose.  Sit down and eat your\nsupper.\n\nWhen he had eaten and drunk he was tired, and laid his head in\nhis grandmother's lap, and told her she should louse him a little.\nIt was not long before he was fast asleep, snoring and breathing\nheavily.  Then the old woman took hold of a golden hair, pulled\nit out, and laid it down beside her.  Oh, cried the devil,\nwhat are you doing.  I have had a bad dream, answered the\ngrandmother, so I seized hold of your hair.  What did you dream\nthen, said the devil.  I dreamt that a fountain in a market-place\nfrom which wine once flowed was dried up, and not even water\nwould flow out of it - what is the cause of it.  Oh, ho, if they\ndid but know it, answered the devil, there is a toad sitting\nunder a stone in the well - if they killed it, the wine would flow\nagain.\n\nThe grandmother loused him again until he went to sleep and\nsnored so that the windows shook.  Then she pulled the second hair\nout.  Ha, what are you doing, cried the devil angrily.  Do not\ntake it ill, said she, I did it in a dream.  What have you dreamt\nthis time, asked he.  I dreamt that in a certain kingdom there\nstood an apple-tree which had once borne golden apples, but now\nwould not even bear leaves.  What, think you, was the reason.\nOh, if they did but know, answered the devil.  A mouse is\ngnawing at the root - if they killed it they would have golden\napples again, but if it gnaws much longer the tree will wither\naltogether.  But I have had enough of your dreams, if you disturb\nme in my sleep again you will get a box on the ear.\n\nThe grandmother spoke gently to him and picked his lice once\nmore until he fell asleep and snored.  Then she took hold of the\nthird golden hair and pulled it out.  The devil jumped up,\nroared out, and would have treated her ill if she had not\nquieted him again and said, who can help bad dreams.  What\nwas the dream, then, asked he, and was quite curious.  I dreamt\nof a ferryman who complained that he must always ferry from\none side to the other, and was never released.  What is the\ncause of it.  Ah, the fool, answered the devil, when anyone\ncomes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand,\nand the other man will have\nto ferry and he will be free.  As the grandmother had plucked\nout the three golden hairs, and the three questions were\nanswered, she let the old devil alone, and he slept until\ndaybreak.\n\nWhen the devil had gone out again the old woman took the ant\nout of the folds of her dress, and gave the child of good\nfortune his human shape again.  There are the three golden\nhairs for you, said she.  What the devil said to your three\nquestions, I suppose you heard.  Yes, answered he, I heard, and\nwill take care to remember.  You have what you want, said she,\nand now you can go your way.  He thanked the old woman for\nhelping him in his need, and left hell well content that\neverything had turned out so fortunately.\n\nWhen he came to the ferryman he was expected to give the\npromised answer.  Ferry me across first, said the child of good\nfortune, and then I will tell you how you can be set free, and\nwhen he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil's advice.\nNext time anyone comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the\noar in his hand.\n\nHe went on and came to the town wherein stood the unfruitful\ntree, and there too the watchman wanted an answer.  So he\ntold him what he had heard from the devil.  Kill the mouse\nwhich is gnawing at its root, and it will again bear golden\napples.  Then the watchman thanked him, and gave him as a reward\ntwo asses laden with gold, which followed him.\n\nFinally, he came to the town whose well was dry.  He told the\nwatchman what the devil had said, a toad is in the well beneath\na stone, you must find it and kill it, and the well will again\ngive wine in plenty.  The watchman thanked him, and also\ngave him two asses laden with gold.\n\nAt last the child of good fortune got home to his wife, who\nwas heartily glad to see him again, and to hear how well he had\nprospered in everything.  To the king he took what he had asked\nfor, the devil's three golden hairs, and when the king saw the\nfour asses laden with gold he was quite content, and said, now\nall the conditions are fulfilled, and you can keep my daughter.\n\nBut tell\nme, dear son-in-law, where did all that gold come from - this\nis tremendous wealth.  I was rowed across a river, answered he,\nand got it there, it lies on the shore instead of sand.  Can I\ntoo fetch some of it, said the king, and he was quite eager\nabout it.  As much as you like, answered he.  There is a\nferryman on the river, let him ferry you over, and you can fill\nyour sacks on the other side.  The greedy king set out in all\nhaste, and when he came to the river he beckoned to the ferryman\nto put him across.  The ferryman came and bade him get in,\nand when they got to the other shore he put the oar in his\nhand and sprang over.  But from this time forth the king had to\nferry, as a punishment for his sins.  Perhaps he is ferrying\nstill.  If he is, it is because no one has taken the oar from\nhim.\n", "The Girl Without Hands": "A certain miller had little by little fallen into poverty, and\nhad nothing left but his mill and a large apple-tree behind\nit.  Once when he had gone into the forest to fetch wood, an\nold man stepped up to him whom he had never seen before, and\nsaid, why do you plague yourself with cutting wood, I will\nmake you rich, if you will promise me what is standing behind\nyour mill.  What can that be but my apple-tree, thought the\nmiller, and said, yes, and gave a written promise to the\nstranger.  He, however, laughed mockingly and said, when three\nyears have passed, I will come and carry away what belongs to me,\nand then he went.  When the miller got home, his wife came to\nmeet him and said, tell me, miller, from whence comes this\nsudden wealth into our house.  All at once every box and chest\nwas filled, no one brought it in, and I know not how it\nhappened.  He answered, it comes from a stranger who met me in\nthe forest, and promised me great treasure.  I' in return,\nhave promised him what stands behind the mill - we can very\nwell give him the big apple-tree for it.  Ah, husband, said the\nterrified wife, that must have been the devil.  He did not mean the\napple-tree, but our daughter, who was standing behind the mill\nsweeping the yard.\n\nThe miller's daughter was a beautiful, pious girl, and lived\nthrough the three years in the fear of God and without sin.  When\ntherefore the time was over, and the day came when the evil one\nwas to fetch her, she washed herself clean, and made a circle\nround herself with chalk.  The devil appeared quite early, but\nhe could not come near to her.  Angrily, he said to the miller,\ntake all water away from her, that she may no longer be able to\nwash herself, for otherwise I have no power over her.  The\nmiller was afraid, and did so.  The next morning the devil came\nagain, but she had wept on her hands, and they were quite\nclean.  Again he could not get near her, and furiously said to\nthe miller, cut her hands off, or else I have no power over\nher.  The miller was shocked and answered, how could I cut off my\nown child's hands.  Then the evil one threatened him and said,\nif you do not do it you are mine, and I will take you yourself.\n\nThe father became alarmed, and promised to obey him.  So he\nwent to the girl and said, my child, if I do not cut off both\nyour hands, the devil will carry me away, and in my terror\nI have promised to do it.  Help me in my need, and forgive me\nthe harm I do you.  She replied, dear father, do with me what\nyou will, I am your child.  Thereupon she laid down both her\nhands, and let them be cut off.  The devil came for the third\ntime, but she had wept so long and so much on the stumps, that\nafter all they were quite clean.  Then he had to give in, and\nhad lost all right over her.\n\nThe miller said to her, I have by means of you received such\ngreat wealth that I will keep you most handsomely as long as\nyou live.  But she replied, here I cannot stay, I will go forth,\ncompassionate people will give me as much as I require.\n\nThereupon she caused her maimed arms to be bound to her back,\nand by sunrise she set out on her way, and walked the whole day\nuntil night fell.  Then she came to a royal garden, and by\nthe shimmering of the moon she saw that trees covered with\nbeautiful fruits grew in\nit, but she could not enter, for it was surrounded by water.\nAnd as she had walked the whole day and not eaten one mouthful,\nand hunger tormented her, she thought, ah, if I were but inside,\nthat I might eat of the fruit, else must I die of hunger.  Then\nshe knelt down, called on God the Lord, and prayed.  And\nsuddenly an angel came towards her, who made a dam in the water,\nso that the moat became dry and she could walk through it.  And\nnow she went into the garden and the angel went with her.  She\nsaw a tree covered with beautiful pears, but they were all\ncounted.  Then she went to them, and to still her hunger, ate\none with her mouth from the tree, but no more.  The gardener\nwas watching, but as the angel was standing by, he was afraid\nand thought the maiden was a spirit, and was silent, neither\ndid he dare to cry out, or to speak to the spirit.  When she had\neaten the pear, she was satisfied, and went and concealed herself\namong the bushes.  The king to whom the garden belonged, came\ndown to it next morning, and counted, and saw that one of the\npears was missing, and asked the gardener what had become of it,\nas it was not lying beneath the tree, but was gone.  Then\nanswered the gardener, last night, a spirit came in, who had no\nhands, and ate off one of the pears with its mouth.  The king\nsaid, how did the spirit get over the water, and where did it go\nafter it had eaten the pear.  The gardener answered, someone\ncame in a snow-white garment from heaven who made a dam, and\nkept back the water, that the spirit might walk through the moat.\nAnd as it must have been an angel, I was afraid, and asked\nno questions, and did not cry out.  When the spirit had eaten\nthe pear, it went back again.  The king said, if it be as you\nsay, I will watch with you to-night.\n\nWhen it grew dark the king came into the garden and brought\na priest with him, who was to speak to the spirit.  All three\nseated themselves beneath the tree and watched.  At midnight the\nmaiden came creeping out of the thicket, went to the tree, and\nagain ate one pear off it with her mouth, and beside her stood\nthe angel in white garments.  Then the priest went out to them\nand said, \"Do you come from heaven or from earth?  Are you a\nspirit, or a human\nbeing?\"  She replied, \"I am no spirit, but an unhappy mortal\ndeserted by all but God.\"  The king said, \"If you are forsaken\nby all the world, yet will I not forsake you.\"  He took her with\nhim into his royal palace, and as she was so beautiful and good,\nhe loved her with all his heart, had silver hands made for her,\nand took her to wife.\n\nAfter a year the king had to go on a journey, so he commended\nhis young queen to the care of his mother and said, if she\nis brought to child-bed take care of her, nurse her well,\nand tell me of it at once in a letter.  Then she gave birth to\na fine boy.  So the old mother made haste to write and announce\nthe joyful news to him.  But the messenger rested by a brook\non the way, and as he was fatigued by the great distance, he\nfell asleep.  Then came the devil, who was always seeking to\ninjure the good queen, and exchanged the letter for another, in\nwhich was written that the queen had brought a monster into\nthe world.  When the king read the letter he was shocked and\nmuch troubled, but he wrote in answer that they were to take\ngreat care of the queen and nurse her well until his arrival.\n\nThe messenger went back with the letter, but rested at the\nsame place and again fell asleep.  Then came the devil\nonce more, and put a different letter in his pocket, in which\nit was written that they were to put the queen and her child to\ndeath.  The old mother was terribly shocked when she received\nthe letter, and could not believe it.  She wrote back again to\nthe king, but received no other answer, because each time the\ndevil substituted a false letter, and in the last letter it was\nalso written that she was to preserve the queen's tongue and\neyes as a token that she had obeyed.\n\nBut the old mother wept to think such innocent blood was to\nbe shed, and had a hind brought by night and cut out her tongue\nand eyes, and kept them.  Then said she to the queen, \"I cannot\nhave you killed as the king commands, but here you may stay\nno longer.  Go forth into the wide world with your child, and\nnever come here again.\"  The poor woman tied her child on her back,\nand went away with eyes full of tears.  She came into a great wild\nforest, and then she fell on her knees and prayed to God, and the\nangel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a little house\non which was a sign with the words, here all dwell free.  A\nsnow-white maiden came out of the little house and said, welcome,\nlady queen, and conducted her inside.  Then she unbound the\nlittle boy from her back, and held him to her breast that he might\nfeed, and laid him in a beautifully-made little bed.  Then\nsaid the poor woman, \"From whence do you know that I was a queen?\"\n\nThe white maiden answered, \"I am an angel sent by God, to watch\nover you and your child.\"  The queen stayed seven years in the\nlittle house, and was well cared for, and by God's grace, because\nof her piety, her hands which had been cut off, grew once more.\n\nAt last the king came home again from his journey, and his first\nwish was to see his wife and the child.  Then his aged mother\nbegan to weep and said, \"You wicked man, why did you write to me\nthat I was to take those two innocent lives,\" and she showed him\nthe two letters which the evil one had forged, and then\ncontinued, \"I did as you bade me, and she showed the tokens, the\ntongue and eyes.\"  Then the king began to weep for his poor wife\nand his little son so much more bitterly than she was doing,\nthat the aged mother had compassion on him and said, \"be at peace,\nshe still lives, I secretly caused a hind to be killed, and\ntook these tokens from it, but I bound the child to your wife's\nback and bade her go forth into the wide world, and made her\npromise never to come back here again, because you were so\nangry with her.\"  Then spoke the king, \"I will go as far as\nthe sky is blue, and will neither eat nor drink until I have\nfound again my dear wife and my child, if in the meantime they\nhave not been killed, or died of hunger.\"\n\nThereupon the king traveled about for seven long years, and\nsought her in every cleft of the rocks and in every cave, but\nhe found her not, and thought she had died of want.  During the\nwhole time he neither ate nor drank, but God supported him.  At\nlength he came into a great forest, and found therein the little\nhouse whose sign was, here all dwell free.  Then forth came\nthe white maiden, took him by the hand, led him in, and said,\n\"Welcome, lord king,\" and asked him from whence he came.  He\nanswered, \"Soon shall I have traveled about for the space of\nseven years, and I seek my wife and her child, but cannot find\nthem.\"  The angel offered him meat and drink, but he did not\ntake anything, and only wished to rest a little.  Then he lay\ndown to sleep, and laid a handkerchief over his face.\n\nThereupon the angel went into the chamber where the queen\nsat with her son, whom she usually called Sorrowful, and\nsaid to her, go out with your child, your husband has come.  So\nshe went to the place where he lay, and the handkerchief\nfell from his face.  Then said she, \"Sorrowful, pick up your\nfather's handkerchief, and cover his face again.\"  The child picked\nit up, and put it over his face again.  The king in his sleep\nheard what passed, and had pleasure in letting the handkerchief\nfall once more.  But the child grew impatient, and said,\n\"Dear mother, how can I cover my father's face when I have no\nfather in this world.  I have learnt to say the prayer - Our\nFather, which art in heaven - you have told me that my father\nwas in heaven, and was the good God, and how can I know a wild\nman like this.  He is not my father.\"  When the king heard that,\nhe got up, and asked who they were.  Then said\nshe, \"I am your wife, and that is your son, Sorrowful\".  And he\nsaw her living hands, and said, \"My wife had silver hands.\"  She\nanswered, \"The good God has caused my natural hands to grow again,\"\nand the angel went into the inner room, and brought the silver\nhands, and showed them to him.  Hereupon he knew for a certainty\nthat it was his dear wife and his dear child, and he kissed\nthem, and was glad, and said, \"A heavy stone has fallen from off\nmy heart.\"  Then the angel of God ate with them once again, and\nafter that they went home to the king's aged mother.  There were\ngreat rejoicings everywhere, and the king and queen were married\nagain, and lived contentedly to their happy end.\n", "The Wishing-Table, the Gold-Ass, and the Cudgel in the Sack": "There was once upon a time a tailor who had three sons, and\nonly one goat.  But as the goat supported all of them with\nher milk, she was obliged to have good food, and to be taken\nevery day to pasture.  The sons did this, in turn.  Once the eldest\ntook her to the churchyard, where the finest herbs were to be found,\nand let her eat and run about there.  At night when it was time to\ngo home he asked, goat, have you had enough.  The goat answered\n     I have eaten so much,\n     not a leaf more I'll touch, meh. Meh.\n\nCome home, then, said the youth, and took hold of the cord\nround her neck, led her into the stable and tied her up securely.\nWell, said the old tailor, has the goat had as much food as she\nought.  Oh, answered the son, she has eaten so much, not a\nleaf more she'll touch.  But the father wished to satisfy himself,\nand went down to the stable, stroked the dear animal and asked,\ngoat, are you satisfied.  The goat answered,\n     how should I be satisfied.\n     Among the ditches I leapt about,\n     found no leaf, so went without, meh. Meh.\n\nWhat do I hear, cried the tailor, and ran upstairs and said to the\nyouth.  HI, you liar, you said the goat had had enough, and have\nlet her hunger, and in his anger he took the yard-measure from\nthe wall, and drove him out with blows.\n\nNext day it was the turn of the second son, who sought a place\nin the fence of the garden, where nothing but good herbs grew, and\nthe goat gobbled them all up.  At night when he wanted to go home,\nhe asked, goat, are you satisfied.  The goat answered,\n     I have eaten so much,\n     not a leaf more I'll touch, meh. Meh.\n\nCome home, then, said the youth, and led her home, and tied her\nup in the stable.  Well, said the old tailor, has the goat had as\nmuch food as she ought.  Oh, answered the son, she has eaten\nso much, not a leaf more she'll touch.  The tailor would not rely\non this, but went down to the stable and said, goat, have you had\nenough.  The goat answered,\n     how should I be satisfied.\n     Among the ditches I leapt about,\n     found no leaf, so went without, meh. Meh.\n\nThe godless wretch. Cried the tailor, to let such a good animal\nhunger, and he ran up and drove the youth out of doors with the\nyard-measure.\n\nNow came the turn of the third son, who wanted to do his duty\nwell, and sought out some bushes with the finest leaves, and let the\ngoat devour them.  In the evening when he wanted to go home, he\nasked, goat, have you had enough.  The goat answered,\n     I have eaten so much,\n     not a leaf more I'll touch, meh. Meh.\n\nCome home, then, said the youth, and led her into the stable, and\ntied her up.  Well, said the old tailor, has the goat had her full\nshare of food.  She has eaten so much, not a leaf more she'll\ntouch.  The tailor was distrustful, went down and asked, goat,\nhave you had enough.  The wicked beast answered,\n     how should I be satisfied.\n     Among the ditches I leapt about,\n     found no leaf, so went without, meh. Meh.\n\nOh, the brood of liars, cried the tailor, each as wicked and\nforgetful of his duty as the other.  You shall no longer make a\nfool of me, and quite beside himself with anger, he ran upstairs\nand belabored the poor young fellow so vigorously with the\nyard-measure that he sprang out of the house.\n\nThe old tailor was now alone with his goat.  Next morning he\nwent down into the stable, stroked the goat and said, come, my\ndear little animal, I myself will take you to feed.  He took her\nby the rope and conducted her to green hedges, and amongst milfoil\nand whatever else goats like to eat.  There you may for once eat to\nyour heart's content, said he to her, and let her browse till\nevening.  Then he asked, goat, are you satisfied.  She replied.\n     I have eaten so much,\n     not a leaf more I'll touch, meh. Meh.\n\nCome home, then, said the tailor, and led her into the stable, and\ntied her fast.  When he was going away, he turned round again and\nsaid, well, are you satisfied for once.  But the goat behaved no\nbetter to him, and cried,\n     how should I be satisfied.\n     Among the ditches I leapt about,\n     found no leaf, so went without, meh. Meh.\n\nWhen the tailor heard that, he was shocked, and saw clearly that\nhe had driven away his three sons without cause.  Wait, you\nungrateful creature, cried he, it is not enough to drive you forth,\nI will brand you so that you will no more dare to show yourself\namongst honest tailors.  In great haste he ran upstairs, fetched his\nrazor, lathered the goat's head, and shaved her as clean as the palm\nof his hand.  And as the yard-measure would have been too good for\nher, he brought the horsewhip, and gave her such cuts with it that\nshe bounded away with tremendous leaps.\n\nWhen the tailor was thus left quite alone in his house he fell into\ngreat grief, and would gladly have had his sons back again, but no\none knew whither they were gone.  The eldest had apprenticed\nhimself to a joiner, and learnt industriously and indefatigably,\nand when the time came for him to go traveling, his master presented\nhim with a little table which was not particularly beautiful, and\nwas made of common wood, but which had one good property.  If\nanyone set it out, and said, little table, spread yourself, the good\nlittle table was at once covered with a clean little cloth, and a\nplate was there, and a knife and fork beside it, and dishes with\nboiled meats and roasted meats, as many as there was room for, and a\ngreat glass of red wine shone so that it made the heart glad.  The\nyoung journeyman thought, with this you have enough for your\nwhole life, and went joyously about the world and never troubled\nhimself at all whether an inn was good or bad, or if anything was\nto be found in it or not.  When it suited him he did not enter an\ninn at all, but either on the plain, in a wood, a meadow, or\nwherever he fancied, he took his little table off his back, set it\ndown before him, and said, spread yourself, and then everything\nappeared that his heart desired.  At length he took it into his head\nto go back to his father, whose anger would now be appeased, and\nwho would now willingly receive him with his magic table.  It came\nto pass that on his way home, he came one evening to an inn which\nwas filled with guests.  They bade him welcome, and invited him to\nsit and eat with them, for otherwise he would have difficulty in\ngetting anything.  No, answered the joiner, I will not take the few\nmorsels out of\nyour mouths.  Rather than that, you shall be my guests.  They\nlaughed, and thought he was jesting with them.  He but placed his\nwooden table in the middle of the room, and said, little table,\nspread yourself.  Instantly it was covered with food, so good that\nthe host could never have procured it, and the smell of it\nascended pleasantly to the nostrils of the guests.  Fall to, dear\nfriends, said the joiner, and the guests when they saw that he\nmeant it, did not need to be asked twice, but drew near, pulled out\ntheir knives and attacked it valiantly.  And what surprised them the\nmost was that when a dish became empty, a full one instantly took\nits place of its own accord.  The innkeeper stood in one corner and\nwatched the affair.  He did not at all know what to say, but\nthought, you could easily find a use for such a cook as that in your\nhousehold.  The joiner and his comrades made merry until late\ninto the night.  At length they lay down to sleep, and the young\napprentice also went to bed, and set his magic table against the\nwall.  The host's thoughts, however, let him have no rest.  It\noccurred to him that there was a little old table in his lumber-room\nwhich looked just like the apprentice's and he brought it out,\nand carefully exchanged it for the wishing table.  Next morning\nthe joiner paid for his bed, took up his table, never thinking\nthat he had got a false one, and went his way.  At mid-day he\nreached his father, who received him with great joy.  Well, my dear\nson, what have you learnt.  Said he to him.  Father, I have become\na joiner.\n\nA good trade, replied the old man, but what have you brought\nback with you from your apprenticeship.  Father, the best thing\nwhich I have brought back with me is this little table.  The\ntailor inspected it on all sides and said, you did not make a\nmasterpiece when you made that.  It is a bad old table.  But it\nis a table which furnishes itself, replied the son.  When I set it\nout, and tell it to spread itself, the most beautiful dishes stand\non it, and a wine also, which gladdens the heart.  Just invite all\nour relations and friends, they shall refresh and enjoy themselves\nfor once, for the table will give them all they require.  When the\ncompany was assembled, he put his table in the middle of the room and\nsaid, little table,\nspread yourself, but the little table did not bestir itself, and\nremained just as bare as any other table which does not understand\nlanguage.  Then the poor apprentice became aware that his table\nhad been changed, and was ashamed at having to stand there like a\nliar.  The relations, however, mocked him, and were forced to go\nhome without having eaten or drunk.  The father brought out his\npatches again, and went on tailoring, but the son went to a\nmaster in the craft.\n\nThe second son had gone to a miller and had apprenticed himself\nto him.  When his years were over, the master said, as you\nhave conducted yourself so well, I give you an ass of a peculiar\nkind, which neither draws a cart nor carries a sack.  What good is\nhe, then. Asked the young apprentice.  He spews forth gold, answered\nthe miller.  If you set him on a cloth and say bricklebrit,\nthe good animal will spew forth gold pieces for you from back and\nfront.  That is a fine thing, said the apprentice, and thanked the\nmaster, and went out into the world.  When he had need of gold,\nhe had only to say bricklebrit to his ass, and it rained gold\npieces, and he had nothing to do but pick them off the ground.\nWheresoever he went, the best of everything was good enough for\nhim, and the dearer the better, for he had always a full purse.\nWhen he had looked about the world for some time, he thought, you\nmust seek out your father.  If you go to him with the gold-ass he\nwill forget his anger, and receive you well.  It came to pass\nthat he came to the same inn in which his brother's table had been\nexchanged.  He led his ass by the bridle, and the host was about\nto take the animal from him and tie him up, but the young\napprentice said, don't trouble yourself, I will take my grey\nhorse into the stable, and tie him up myself too, for I must know\nwhere he stands.  This struck the host as odd, and he thought\nthat a man who was forced to look after his ass himself, could not\nhave much to spend.  But when the stranger put his hand in his\npocket and brought out two gold pieces, and said he was to\nprovide something good for him, the host opened his eyes wide, and\nran and sought out the best he could muster.  After dinner the\nguest asked what he owed.  The host did\nnot see why he should not double the reckoning, and said the\napprentice must give two more gold pieces.  He felt in his pocket,\nbut his gold was just at an end.  Wait an instant, sir host, said\nhe, I will go and fetch some money.  But he took the table-cloth\nwith him.  The host could not imagine what this could mean, and\nbeing curious, stole after him, and as the guest bolted the stable\ndoor, he peeped through a hole left by a knot in the wood.  The\nstranger spread out the cloth under the animal and cried,\nbricklebrit, and immediately the beast began to let gold pieces fall\nfrom back and front, so that it fairly rained down money on the\nground.  Eh, my word, said the host, ducats are quickly coined\nthere.  A purse like that is not to be sniffed at.  The guest\npaid his score, and went to bed, but in the night the host stole\ndown into the stable, led away the master of the mint, and tied up\nanother ass in his place.\n\nEarly next morning the apprentice traveled away with his ass,\nand thought that he had his gold-ass.  At mid-day he reached his\nfather, who rejoiced to see him again, and gladly took him in.\nWhat have you made of yourself, my son.  Asked the old man.\nA miller, dear father, he answered.  What have you brought back\nwith you from your travels.  Nothing else but an ass.  There are\nasses enough here, said the father, I would rather have had a good\ngoat.  Yes, replied the son, but it is no common ass, but a\ngold-ass, when I say bricklebrit, the good beast spews forth a whole\nsheetful of gold pieces.  Just summon all our relations hither,\nand I will make them rich folks.  That suits me well, said the\ntailor, for then I shall have no need to torment myself any longer\nwith the needle, and ran out himself and called the relations\ntogether.  As soon as they were assembled, the miller bade them\nmake way, spread out his cloth, and brought the ass into the room.\nNow watch, said he, and cried, bricklebrit, but what fell were not\ngold pieces, and it was clear that the animal knew nothing of the\nart, for every ass does not attain such perfection.  Then the poor\nmiller pulled a long face, saw that he was betrayed, and begged\npardon of the relatives, who went home as poor as they came.  There\nwas no help for it, the old man had to betake him to his needle once\nmore, and the youth hired himself to a miller.\n\nThe third brother had apprenticed himself to a turner, and as that\nis skilled labor, he was the longest in learning.  His brothers,\nhowever, told him in a letter how badly things had gone with them,\nand how the innkeeper had cheated them of ther beautiful\nwishing-gifts on the last evening before they reached home.  When\nthe turner had served his time, and had to set out on his travels,\nas he had conducted himself so well, his master presented him with a\nsack and said, there is a cudgel in it.  I can put on the sack, said\nhe, and it may be of good service to me, but why should the cudgel\nbe in it.  It only makes it heavy.  I will tell you why, replied\nthe master.  If anyone has done anything to injure you, do but say,\nout of the sack, cudgel. And the cudgel will leap forth among the\npeople, and play such a dance on their backs that they will not be\nable to stir or move for a week, and it will not leave off until\nyou say, into the sack, cudgel.  The apprentice thanked him, and\nput the sack on his back, and when anyone came too near him, and\nwished to attack him, he said, out of the sack, cudgel, and\ninstantly the cudgel sprang out, and dusted the coat or jacket of\none after the other on their backs, and never stopped until it had\nstripped it off them, and it was done so quickly, that before anyone\nwas aware, it was already his own turn.  In the evening the\nyoung turner reached the inn where his brothers had been cheated.\n\nHe laid his sack on the table before him, and began to talk of all\nthe wonderful things which he had seen in the world.  Yes, said\nhe, people may easily find a table which will spread itself, a\ngold-ass, and things of that kind - extremely good things which\nI by no means despise - but these are nothing in comparison with\nthe treasure which I have won for myself, and am carrying about\nwith me in my sack there.  The innkeeper pricked up his ears.\nWhat in the world can that be.  Thought he.  The sack must be filled\nwith nothing but jewels.  I ought to get them cheap too, for all\ngood things go in threes.  When it was time for sleep, the guest\nstretched himself on the bench, and laid his sack beneath him\nfor a pillow.  When the innkeeper thought his guest\nwas lying in a sound sleep, he went to him and pushed and pulled\nquite gently and carefully at the sack to see if he could possibly\ndraw it away and lay another in its place.\n\nThe turner, however, had been waiting for this for a long time, and\nnow just as the inn-keeper was about to give a hearty tug, he cried,\nout of the sack, cudgel.  Instantly the little cudgel came forth,\nand fell on the inn-keeper and gave him a sound thrashing.\nThe host cried for mercy.  But the louder he cried, the harder the\ncudgel beat the time on his back, until at length he fell to the\nground exhausted.  Then the turner said, if you do not give back\nthe table which spreads itself, and the gold-ass, the dance shall\nbegin afresh.  Oh, no, cried the host, quite humbly, I will gladly\nproduce everything, only make the accursed kobold creep back into\nthe sack.  Then said the apprentice, I will let mercy take the\nplace of justice, but beware of getting into mischief again.  So he\ncried, into the sack, cudgel.  And let him have rest.\n\nNext morning the turner went home to his father with the\nwishing-table, and the gold-ass.  The tailor rejoiced when he saw\nhim once more, and asked him likewise what he had learned in foreign\nparts.  Dear father, said he, I have become a turner.  A skilled\ntrade, said the father.  What have you brought back with you from\nyour travels.\n\nA precious thing, dear father, replied the son, a cudgel in the\nsack.\n\nWhat cried the father, a cudgel.  That's certainly worth your\ntrouble.  From every tree you can cut yourself one.  But not one\nlike this, dear father.  If I say, out of the sack, cudgel, the\ncudgel springs out and leads anyone ill-disposed toward me a weary\ndance, and never stops until he lies on the ground and prays for\nfair weather.  Look you, with this cudgel have I rescued the\nwishing-table and the gold-ass which the thievish innkeeper took\naway from my brothers.  Now let them both be sent for, and invite\nall our kinsmen.  I will give them to eat and to drink, and will\nfill their pockets with gold into the bargain.  The old tailor\nhad not much confidence.  Nevertheless he summoned the relatives\ntogether.  Then the turner spread a cloth in the room and led in the\ngold-ass, and said to his brother, now, dear brother, speak to him.\nThe miller said, bricklebrit, and instantly the gold pices rained\ndown on the cloth like a thunder-shower, and the ass did not stop\nuntil every one of them had so much that he could carry no more.\n - I can see by your face that you also would have liked to be\nthere. -\n\nThen the turner brought the little table, and said, now dear\nbrother, speak to it.  And scarcely had the carpenter said, table,\nspread yourself, than it was spread and amply covered with the\nmost exquisite dishes.  Then such a meal took place as the good\ntailor had never yet known in his house, and the whole party of\nkinsmen stayed together till far in the night, and were all merry\nand glad.  The tailor locked away needle and thread, yard-measure\nand goose, in a closet, and lived with his three sons in joy and\nsplendor.\n\nWhat, however, happened to the goat who was to blame for the\ntailor driving out his three sons?  That I will tell you.  She\nwas ashamed that she had a bald head, and ran to a fox's hole and\ncrept into it.  When the fox came home, he was met by two great\neyes shining out of the darkness, and was terrified and ran away.\nA bear met him, and as the fox looked quite disturbed, he said,\nwhat is the matter with you, brother fox, why do you look like\nthat.  Ah, answered redskin, a fierce beast is in my cave and stared\nat me with its fiery eyes.  We will soon drive him out, said\nthe bear, and went with him to the cave and looked in, but when\nhe saw the fiery eyes, fear seized on him likewise.  He would have\nnothing to do with the furious beast, and took to his heels.  The\nbee met him, and as she saw that he was ill at ease, she said,\nbear, you are really pulling a very pitiful face.  What has become\nof all your gaiety.  It is all very well for you to talk, replied\nthe bear, a furious beast with staring eyes is in redskin's house,\nand we can't drive him out.  The bee said, bear I pity you, I am\na poor weak creature whom you would not turn aside to look at, but\nstill, I believe, I can help you.  She flew into the fox's cave,\nlighted on the goat's smoothly-shorn head, and stung her so\nviolently, that she sprang up, crying meh, meh, and ran forth\ninto the world as if mad, and to this hour no one knows where she\nhas gone.\n", "Thumbling": "There was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the\nhearth and poked the fire, and his wife sat and spun.  Then\nsaid he, how sad it is that we have no children.  With us all\nis so quiet, and in other houses it is noisy and lively.\nYes, replied the wife, and sighed, even if we had only one,\nand it were quite small, and only as big as a thumb, I should be\nquite satisfied, and we would still love it with all our hearts.\nNow it so happened that the woman fell ill, and after seven\nmonths gave birth to a child, that was perfect in all its limbs,\nbut no longer than a thumb.  Then said they, it is as we wished\nit to be, and it shall be our dear child.  And because of its\nsize, they called it thumbling.  Though they did not let it want\nfor food, the child did not grow taller, but remained as it had\nbeen at the first.  Nevertheless it looked sensibly out of its\neyes, and soon showed itself to be a wise and nimble creature,\nfor everything it did turned out well.\n\nOne day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to\ncut wood, when he said as if to himself, how I wish that there\nwas someone who would bring the cart to me.  Oh father, cried\nthumbling, I will soon bring the cart, rely on that.  It shall\nbe in the forest at the appointed time.  The man smiled and\nsaid, how can that be done, you are far too small to lead the\nhorse by the reins.  That's of no consequence, father, if my\nmother will only harness it, I shall sit in the horse's ear\nand call out to him how he is to go.  Well, answered the man,\nfor once we will try it.\n\nWhen the time came, the mother harnessed the horse, and placed\nthumbling in its ear, and then the little creature cried, gee\nup, gee up.\n\nThen it went quite properly as if with its master, and the cart\nwent the right way into the forest.  It so happened that just\nas he was turning a corner, and the little one was crying, gee\nup, two strange men came towards him.  My word, said one of them,\nwhat is this.  There is a cart coming, and a driver is calling to\nthe horse and still he is not to be seen.  That can't be right,\nsaid the other, we will follow the cart and see where it stops.  The\ncart, however, drove right into the forest, and exactly to the\nplace where the wood had been cut.  When thumbling saw his\nfather, he cried to him, do you see, father, here I am with the\ncart, now take me down.  The father got hold of the horse with\nhis left hand and with the right took his little son out of the\near.  Thumbling sat down quite merrily on a straw, but when the\ntwo strange men\nsaw him, they did not know what to say for\nastonishment.  Then one of them took the other aside and said,\nlisten, the little fellow would make our fortune if we exhibited\nhim in a large town, for money.  We will buy him.  They went to\nthe peasant and said, sell us the little man.  He shall be well\ntreated with us.  No, replied the father, he is the apple of my\neye, and all the money in the world cannot buy him from me.\n\nThumbling, however, when he heard of the bargain, had crept up\nthe folds of his father's coat, placed himself on his shoulder,\nand whispered in his ear, father do give me away, I will soon\ncome back again.  Then the father parted with him to the two\nmen for a handsome sum of money.  Where will you sit, they\nsaid to him.  Oh just set me on the rim of your hat, and then I\ncan walk backwards and forwards and look at the country, and\nstill not fall down.  They did as he wished, and when thumbling\nhad taken leave of his father, they went away with him.  They\nwalked until it was dusk, and then the little fellow said,\ndo take me down, it is necessary.  Just stay up there, said the\nman on whose hat he sat, it makes no difference to me.  The birds\nsometimes let things fall on me.  No, said thumbling, I\nknow what's manners, take me quickly down.  The man took his hat\noff, and put the little fellow on the ground by the wayside, and\nhe leapt and crept about a little between the sods, and then he\nsuddenly slipped into a mousehole which he had sought out.\nGood evening, gentlemen, just go home without me, he cried to\nthem, and mocked them.  They ran thither and stuck their sticks\ninto the mousehole, but it was all in vain.  Thumbling crept\nstill farther in, and as it soon became quite\ndark, they were forced to go home with their vexation and\ntheir empty purses.\n\nWhen thumbling saw that they were gone, he crept back out of the\nsubterranean passage.  It is so dangerous to walk on the ground\nin the dark, said he, how easily a neck or a leg is broken.\nFortunately he stumbled against an empty snail-shell.  Thank God,\nsaid he, in that I can pass the night in safety.  And got into it.\nNot long afterwards, when he was just going to sleep, he heard two\nmen go by, and one of them was saying, how shall we set about\ngetting hold of the rich pastor's silver and gold.  I could tell\nyou that, cried thumbling, interrupting them.  What was that, said\none of the thieves in fright, I heard someone speaking.  They stood\nstill listening, and thumbling spoke again, and said, take\nme with you, and I'll help you.\n\nBut where are you.  Just look on the ground, and observe from\nwhence my voice comes, he replied.  There the thieves at length\nfound him, and lifted him up.  You little imp, how will you help\nus, they said.  Listen, said he, I will creep into the pastor's\nroom through the iron bars, and will reach out to you whatever\nyou want to have.  Come then, they said, and we will see what you\ncan do.  When they got to the pastor's house, thumbling crept into\nthe room, but instantly cried out with all his might, do you want\nto have everything that is here.  The thieves were alarmed, and\nsaid, but do speak softly, so as not to waken any one.  Thumbling\nhowever, behaved as if he had not understood this, and cried\nagain, what do you want.  Do you want to have everything that is\nhere.  The cook, who slept in the next room, heard this and sat up\nin bed, and listened.  The thieves, however, had in their fright\nrun some distance away, but at last they took courage, and\nthought, the little rascal wants to mock us.  They came back and\nwhispered to him, come be serious, and reach something out to us.\nThen thumbling again cried as loudly as he could, I really will\ngive you everything, just put your hands in.  The maid who was\nlistening, heard this quite distinctly, and jumped out of bed\nand rushed to the door.  The thieves took flight, and ran as if\nthe wild huntsman\nwere behind them, but as the maid could not see\nanything, she went to strike a light.  When she came to the\nplace with it, thumbling, unperceived, betook himself to the\ngranary, and the maid after she had examined every corner and\nfound nothing, lay down in her bed again, and believed that,\nafter all, she had only been dreaming with open eyes and ears.\nThumbling had climbed up among the hay and found a beautiful\nplace to sleep in.  There he intended to rest until day, and\nthen go home again to his parents.  But there were other things in\nstore for him.  Truly, there is much worry and affliction in\nthis world.  When the day dawned, the maid arose from her bed to\nfeed the cows.  Her first walk was into the barn, where she laid\nhold of an armful of hay, and precisely that very one in which\npoor thumbling was lying asleep.  He, however, was sleeping so\nsoundly that he was aware of nothing, and did not awake until he\nwas in the mouth of the cow, who had picked him up with the hay.\n\nAh, heavens, cried he, how have I got into the fulling mill.  But\nhe soon discovered where he was. Then he had to take care not to\nlet himself go between the teeth and be dismembered, but he was\nsubsequently forced to slip down into the stomach with the hay.\nIn this little room the windows are forgotten, said he, and no\nsun shines in, neither will a candle be brought.  His quarters\nwere especially unpleasing to him, and the worst was that more\nand more hay was always coming in by the door, and the space grew\nless and less.  When at length in his anguish, he cried as\nloud as he could, bring me no more fodder, bring me no more\nfodder.  The maid was just milking the cow, and when she heard\nsome one speaking, and saw no one, and perceived that it was the\nsame voice that she had heard in the night, she was so\nterrified that she slipped off her stool, and spilt the milk.\n\nShe ran in great haste to her master, and said, oh heavens,\npastor, the cow has been speaking.  You are mad, replied the\npastor, but he went himself to the byre to see what was there.\nHardly, however had he set his foot inside when thumbling again\ncried, bring me no more fodder, bring me no more fodder.  Then\nthe pastor himself was alarmed, and thought that an evil\nspirit had gone into the cow, and ordered her to be killed.  She was\nkilled, but the stomach, in which thumbling was, was thrown on\nthe dunghill.  Thumbling had great difficulty in working his\nway out.  However, he succeeded so far as to get some room, but\njust as he was going to thrust his head out, a new misfortune\noccurred.  A hungry wolf ran thither, and swallowed the whole\nstomach at one gulp.  Thumbling did not lose courage.  Perhaps,\nthought he, the wolf will listen to what I have got to say.  And\nhe called to him from out of his belly, dear wolf, I know of a\nmagnificent feast for you.\n\nWhere is it to be had, said the wolf.\nIn such and such a house.  You must creep into it through the\nkitchen-sink, and will find cakes, and bacon, and sausages, and\nas much of them as you can eat.  And he described to him exactly\nhis father's house.  The wolf did not require to be told this\ntwice, squeezed himself in at night through the sink, and ate to\nhis heart's content in the larder.  When he had eaten his fill,\nhe wanted to go out again, but he had become so big that he could\nnot go out by the same way.  Thumbling had reckoned on this, and\nnow began to make a violent noise in the wolf's body, and raged\nand screamed as loudly as he could.  Will you be quiet, said the\nwolf, you will waken up the people.  What do I care, replied the\nlittle fellow, you have eaten your fill, and I will make merry\nlikewise.  And began once more to scream with all his strength.\n\nAt last his father and mother were aroused by it, and ran to the\nroom and looked in through the opening in the door.  When they\nsaw that a wolf was inside, they ran away, and teh husband\nfetched his axe, and the wife the scythe.  Stay behind, said the\nman, when they entered the room.  When I have given the blow, if\nhe is not killed by it, you must cut him down and hew his body\nto pieces.  Then thumbling heard his parents, voices and cried,\ndear father, I am here, I am in the wolf's body.  Said the father,\nfull of joy, thank God, our dear child has found us again. And\nbade the\nwoman take away her scythe, that thumbling might not be hurt\nwith it.  After that he raised his arm, and struck the wolf\nsuch a blow on his head that he fell down\ndead, and then they got knives and scissors and cut his body open\nand drew the little fellow forth.\n\nAh, said the father, what sorrow we have gone through for your\nsake.  Yes father, I have gone about the world a great deal.\nThank heaven, I breathe fresh air again.  Where have you been,\nthen.  Ah, father, I have been in a mouse's hole, in a cow's\nbelly, and then in a wolf's paunch.  Now I will stay with you.\nAnd we will not sell you again, no not for all the riches in\nthe world, said his parents, and they embraced and kissed their\ndear thumbling.  They gave him to eat and to drink, and had\nsome new clothes made for him, for his own had been spoiled\non his journey.\n", "The Elves (Two Stories)": "There was once a poor servant-girl who was industrious and cleanly\nand swept the house every day, and emptied her sweepings on the\ngreat heap in front of the door.  One morning when she was just\ngoing back to her work, she found a letter on this heap, and as\nshe could not read, she put her broom in the corner, and took the\nletter to her employers, and behold it was an invitation from\nthe elves, who asked the girl to hold a child for them at its\nchristening.  The girl did not know what to do, but, at length,\nafter much persuasion, and as they told her that it was not\nright to refuse an invitation of this kind, she consented.\n\nThen three elves came and conducted her to a hollow mountain,\nwhere the little folks lived.  Everything there was small, but\nmore elegant and beautiful than can be described.  The baby's\nmother lay in a bed of black ebony ornamented with pearls, the\ncovers were embroidered with gold, the cradle was of ivory, the\nbath-tub of gold.  The girl stood as godmother, and then wanted\nto go home again, but the little elves urgently entreated her to\nstay three days with them.  So she stayed, and passed the time in\npleasure and gaiety, and the little folks did all they could to\nmake her happy.  At last she set out on her way home.  But first\nthey filled her pockets quite full of money, and then they led\nher out of the mountain again.  When she got home, she wanted to\nto begin her work, and took the broom, which was still standing\nin the corner, in her hand and began to sweep.  Then some\nstrangers came out of the house, who asked her who she was, and\nwhat business she had there.  And she had not, as she thought,\nbeen three days with the little men in the mountains, but\nseven years, and in the meantime her former masters had died.\n\nA certain mother had her child taken out of its cradle by the\nelves, and a changeling with a large head and staring eyes,\nwhich would do nothing but eat and drink, lay in its place.\nIn her trouble she went to her neighbor, and asked her advice.\nThe neighbour said that she was to carry the changeling into the\nkitchen, set it down on the hearth, light a fire, and boil\nsome water in two egg-shells, which would make the changeling\nlaugh, and if he laughed, all would be over with him.  The\nwoman did everything that her neighbor bade her.  When she put\nthe egg-shells with water on the fire, goggle-eyes said, I am as\nold now as the wester forest, but never yet have I seen anyone\nboil anything in an egg-shell.  And he began to laugh at it.\n\nWhilst he was laughing, suddenly came a host of little elves, who\nbrought the right child, set it down on the hearth, and took the\nchangeling away with them.\n\n", "The Godfather": "A poor man had so many children that he had already asked\neveryone in the world to be godfather, and when still another\nchild was born, no one else was left whom he could invite.\nHe knew not what to do, and, in his perplexity, he lay down\nand fell asleep.  Then he dreamt that he was to go outside the\ngate,\nand ask the first person he met to be godfather.  When he awoke,\nhe determined to obey his dream, and went outside the gate, and\nasked the first person who came up to him to be godfather.  The\nstranger presented him with a little glass of water, and said,\nthis is a wonderful water, with it you can heal the sick, only\nyou must see where death is standing.  If he is standing by the\npatient's head, give the patient some of the water and he will\nbe healed, but if death is standing by his feet, all trouble\nwill be in vain, for the sick man must die.  From this time forth,\nthe man could always say whether a patient could be saved or\nnot, and became famous for his skill, and earned a great deal\nof money.  Once he was called in to the child of the king, and\nwhen he entered, he saw death standing by the child's head and\ncured it with the water, and he did the same a second time, but\nthe third time death was standing by its feet, and then he knew\nthe child had to die.\n\nOnce the man thought he would visit the godfather, and tell him\nhow he had succeeded with the water.  But when he entered the\nhouse, the strangest things were going on within.  On the first\nflight of stairs, the broom and shovel were disputing, and\nknocking each other about violently.  He asked them, where does\nthe godfather live.  The broom replied, one flight of stairs\nhigher up.  When he came to the second flight, he saw a heap of\ndead fingers lying.  He asked, where does the godfather live.\nOne of the fingers replied, one flight of stairs higher.  On\nthe third flight lay a heap of dead heads, which again directed\nhim to the flight beyond.  On the fourth flight, he saw fishes on\nthe fire, which frizzled in pans and baked themselves.  They,\ntoo, said, one flight of stairs higher.  And when he had\nascended the fifth, he came to the door of a room and peeped\nthrough the keyhole, and there he saw the godfather who had\na pair of long horns.  When he opened the door and went in,\nthe godfather got into bed in a great hurry and covered himself\nup.  Then said the man, sir godfather, what a strange house-hold\nyou have.  When I came to your first flight of stairs, the shovel\nand broom were quarreling, and beating each other violently.\nHow stupid you are, said the godfather.  That was the boy\nand the maid talking to each other.  But on the second flight I\nsaw dead fingers lying.  Oh, how silly you are.  Those were some\nroots of scorzonera.  On the third flight lay a heap of dead\nmen's heads.  Foolish man, those were cabbages.  On the fourth\nflight I saw fishes in a pan, which were hissing and baking\nthemselves.  When he had said that, the fishes came and served\nthemselves up.  And when I got to the fifth flight, I peeped\nthrough the keyhole of a door, and there, godfather, I saw\nyou and you had long, long horns.  Oh, that is not true.  The\nman became alarmed, and ran out, and if he had not, who knows\nwhat the godfather would have done to him.\n", "Frau Trude": "There was once a little girl who was obstinate and inquisitive,\nand when her parents told her to do anything, she did not obey\nthem, so how could she fare well.  One day she said to her\nparents, I have heard so much of frau trude, I will go to her\nsome day.  People say that everything about her does look so\nstrange, and that there are such odd things in her house, that\nI have become quite curious.  Her parents absolutely forbade\nher, and said, frau trude is a bad woman, who does wicked things,\nand if you go to her, you are no longer our child.  But the maiden\ndid not let herself be turned aside by her parents, prohibition,\nand still went to frau trude.  And when she got to her, frau\ntrude said, why are you so pale.  Ah, she replied, and her whole\nbody trembled, I have been so terrified at what I have seen.  What\nhave you seen.  I saw a black man on your steps.  That was a\ncollier.  Then I saw a green man.  That was a huntsman.  After\nthat I saw a blood-red man.  That was a butcher.  Ah, frau\ntrude, I was terrified.  I looked through the window and saw\nnot you, but, as I verily believe, the devil himself with a head\nof fire.  Oho. Said she, then you have seen the witch in her\nproper costume.  I have been waiting for you, and wanting you\na long time already.  You shall give me some light.  Then she\nchanged the girl into a block of wood, and threw it into the\nfire.  And when it was in a full blaze she sat down close to it,\nand warmed herself by it, and said, that shines bright for once\nin a way.\n", "Godfather Death": "A poor man had twelve children and was forced to work night and\nday to give them even bread.  When therefore the thirteenth\ncame into the world, he knew not what to do in his trouble,\nbut ran out into the great highway, and resolved to ask the\nfirst person whom he met to be godfather.  The first to meet\nhim was the good God who already knew what filled his heart,\nand said to him, poor man, I pity you.  I will hold your child\nat its christening, and will take charge of it and make it\nhappy on earth.  The man said, who are you.  I am God.  Then\nI do not desire to have you for a godfather, said the man, you give\nto the rich, and leave the poor to hunger.  Thus spoke the man,\nfor he did not know how wisely God apportions riches and\npoverty.  He turned therefore away from the Lord, and went\nfarther.  Then the devil came to him and said, what do you seek.\nIf you will take me as a godfather for your child, I will give him\ngold in plenty and all the joys of the world as well.  The man\nasked, who are you.  I am the devil.  Then I do not desire to have\nyou for godfather, said the man, you deceive men and lead them\nastray.  He went onwards, and then came death striding up to\nhim with withered legs, and said, take me as godfather.  The\nman asked, who are you.  I am death, and I make all equal.  Then\nsaid the man,\nyou are the right one, you take the rich as well as the poor,\nwithout distinction, you shall be godfather.  Death answered,\nI will make your child rich and famous, for he who has me for a\nfriend can lack nothing.  The man said, next sunday is the\nchristening, be there at the right time.  Death appeared as he\nhad promised, and stood godfather quite in the usual way.\nWhen the boy had grown up, his godfather one day appeared\nand bade him go with him.  He led him forth into a forest, and\nshowed him a herb which grew there, and said, now you shall\nreceive your godfather's present.  I make you a celebrated\nphysician.  When you are called to a patient, I will always appear\nto you.  If I stand by the head of the sick man, you may say with\nconfidence that you will make him well again, and if you give\nhim of this herb he will recover, but if I stand by the patient's\nfeet, he is mine, and you must say that all remedies are in\nvain, and that no physician in the world could save him.  But\nbeware of using the herb against my will, or it might fare\nill with you.\n\nIt was not long before the youth was the most famous physician\nin the whole world.  He had only to look at the patient and he\nknew his condition at once, whether he would recover, or must\nneeds die.  So they said of him, and from far and wide people\ncame to him, sent for him when they had anyone ill, and gave him\nso much money that he soon became a rich man.  Now it so befell\nthat the king became ill, and the physician was summoned, and\nwas to say if recovery were possible.  But when he came to the bed,\ndeath was standing by the feet of the sick man, and the herb\ndid not grow which could save him.  If I could but cheat death for\nonce, thought the physician, he is sure to take it ill if I do\nbut, as I am his godson, he will shut one eye, I will risk it.  He\ntherefore took up the sick man, and laid him the other way, so\nthat now death was standing by his head.  Then he gave the king\nsome of the herbs, and he recovered and grew healthy again.\n\nBut death came to the physician, looking very black and\nangry, threatened him with his finger, and said, you have betrayed\nme, this time I will pardon\nit, as you are my godson, but if you venture it again, it\nwill cost you your neck, for I will take you yourself away\nwith me.\n\nSoon afterwards the king's daughter fell into a severe illness.\nShe was his only child, and he wept day and night, so that he\nbegan to lose the sight of his eyes, and he caused it to be\nmade known that whosoever rescued her from death should be her\nhusband and inherit the crown.  When the physician came to the\nsick girl's bed, he saw death by her feet.  He ought to have\nremembered the warning given by his godfather, but he was so\ninfatuated by the great beauty of the king's daughter, and the\nhappiness of becoming her husband, that he flung all thought to\nthe winds.  He did not see that death was casting angry glances\non him, that he was raising his hand in the air, and threatening\nhim with his withered fist.  He raised up the sick girl,\nand placed her head where her feet had lain.  Then he gave\nher some of the herb, and instantly her cheeks flushed red,\nand life stirred afresh in her.\n\nWhen death saw that for a second time his own property had been\nmisused, he walked up to the physician with long strides, and\nsaid, all is over with you, and now the lot falls on you, and\nseized him so firmly with his ice-cold hand, that he could not\nresist, and led him into a cave below the earth.  There he\nsaw how thousands and thousands of candles were burning in\ncountless rows, some large, some medium-sized, others small.\nEvery instant some were extinguished, and others again burnt up,\nso that the flames seemed to leap hither and thither in\nperpetual change.  See, said death, these are the lights of\nmen's lives.  The large ones belong to children, the medium-sized\nones to married people in their prime, the little ones belong\nto old people, but children and young folks likewise have\noften only a tiny candle.  Show me the light of my life, said\nthe physician, and he thought that it would be still very\ntall.  Death pointed to a little end which was just threatening\nto go out, and said, behold, it is there.  Ah, dear godfather,\nsaid the horrified physician, light a new one for me, do it for\nlove of me, that I may enjoy my life, be king, and the husband of\nthe king's beautiful daughter.  I cannot, answered death,\none must go out\nbefore a new one is lighted.  Then place the old one on a new\none, that will go on burning at once when the old one has come\nto an end, pleaded the physician.  Death behaved as if he were\ngoing to fulfill his wish, and took hold of a tall new candle,\nbut as he desired to revenge himself, he purposely made a mistake\nin fixing it, and the little piece fell down and was extinguished.\nImmediately the physician fell on the ground, and now he himself\nwas in the hands of death.\n", "Thumbling as Journeyman": "A certain tailor had a son, who happened to be small, and\nno bigger than a thumb, and on this account he was always\ncalled thumbling.  He had, however, some courage in him, and\nsaid to his father, father, I must and will go out into the\nworld.  That's right, my son, said the old man, and took a\nlong darning-needle and made a knob of sealing-wax on it at the\nhandle, and there is a sword for you to take with you on the way.\nThen the little tailor wanted to have one more meal with them,\nand hopped into the kitchen to see what his mother had cooked\nfor the last time.  But it was already served, and the dish stood\non the hearth.  Then he said, mother, what is there to eat to-day.\nSee for yourself, said his mother.  So thumbling jumped on to the\nhearth, and peeped into the dish, but as he stretched his neck\nin too far the steam from the food caught hold of him, and carried\nhim up the chimney.  He rode about in the air on the steam for a\nwhile, until at length he sank down to the ground again.  Now\nthe little tailor was outside in the wide world, and he traveled\nabout, and went to a master in his craft, but the food was not\ngood enough for him.  Mistress, if you give us no better food,\nsaid thumbling, I will go away, and early to-morrow morning\nI will write with chalk on\nthe door of your house - too many potatoes, too little meat.\n\nFarewell, mr. Potato-king.  What would you have forsooth,\ngrasshopper, said the mistress, and grew angry, and seized\na dishcloth, and was just going to strike him, but my little\ntailor crept nimbly under a thimble, peeped out from beneath it,\nand put his tongue out at the mistress.  She took up the thimble,\nand wanted to get hold of him, but little thumbling hopped into\nthe cloth, and while the mistress was opening it out and looking\nfor him, he got into a crevice in the table.  Ho, ho, lady\nmistress, cried he, and thrust his head out, and when she began\nto strike him he leapt down into the drawer.  At last, however,\nshe caught him and drove him out of the house.\n\nThe little tailor journeyed on and came to a great forest, and\nthere he fell in with a band of robbers who had a design to\nsteal the king's treasure.  When they saw the little tailor,\nthey thought, a little fellow like that can creep through a\nkey-hole and serve as picklock to us.  HI, there, cried one of\nthem, you giant goliath, will you go to the treasure-chamber\nwith us.  You can slip yourself in and throw out the money.\nThumbling reflected a while, and at length he said, yes, and went\nwith them to the treasure-chamber.  Then he looked at the doors\nabove and below, to see if there was any crack in them.  It was\nnot long before he espied one which was broad enough to let\nhim in.  He was therefore about to get in at once, but one\nof the two sentries who stood before the door, observed him, and\nsaid to the other, what an ugly spider is creeping there, I\nwill kill it.  Let the poor creature alone, said the other,\nit has done you no harm.  Then thumbling got safely through the\ncrevice into the treasure-chamber, opened the window beneath\nwhich the robbers were standing, and threw out to them one\ntaler after another.  When the little tailor was in the full\nswing of his work, he heard the king coming to inspect his\ntreasure-chamber, and crept hastily into a hiding-place.  The king\nnoticed that several solid talers were missing, but could not\nconceive who could have stolen them, for locks and bolts were\nin good condition, and all\nseemed well guarded.  Then he went away again, and said to the\nsentries, be on the watch, someone is after the money.  When\ntherefore thumbling recommenced his labors, they heard the money\nmoving, and a sound of klink, klink, klink.  They ran swiftly\nin to seize the thief, but the little tailor, who heard them\ncoming, was still swifter, and leapt into a corner and covered\nhimself with a taler, so that nothing could be seen of him, and\nat the same time he mocked the sentries and cried, here am I.\nThe sentries ran thither, but as they got there, he had\nalready hopped into another corner under a taler, and was\ncrying, ho, ho, here am I.  And thus he made fools of them,\nand drove them so long round about the treasure-chamber that\nthey were weary and went away.  Then by degrees he threw all the\ntalers out, dispatching the last with all his might, then hopped\nnimbly upon it, and flew down with it through the window.  The\nrobbers paid him great compliments.  You are a valiant hero,\nsaid they, will you be our captain.\n\nThumbling, however, declined, and said he wanted to see the\nworld first.  They now divided the booty, but the little tailor\nonly asked for a kreuzer because he could not carry more.\nThen he once more buckled on his sword, bade the robbers goodbye,\nand took to the road.  First, he went to work with some masters,\nbut he had no liking for that, and at last he hired himself\nas manservant in an inn.  The maids, however, could not endure\nhim, for he saw all they did secretly, without their\nseeing him, and he told their employers what they had taken off\nthe plates, and carried away out of the cellar, for themselves.\nThen said they, wait, and we will pay you out, and arranged with\neach other to play him a trick.  Soon afterwards when one of the\nmaids was mowing in the garden, and saw thumbling jumping about\nand creeping up and down the plants, she mowed him up quickly with\nthe grass, tied all in a great cloth, and secretly threw it to\nthe cows.  Now amongst them there was a great black one, who\nswallowed him down without hurting him.  Down below, however, it\ndid not suit him, for it\nwas quite dark, neither was any candle burning.  When the cow\nwas being milked he cried,\n          strip, strap, strull,\n          when will the pail be full.\n\nBut the noise of the milking prevented his being understood.\nAfter this the master of the house came into the stall and\nsaid, that cow shall be killed to-morrow.  Then thumbling was so\nalarmed that he cried out in a clear voice, let me out first,\nI am sitting inside her.  The master heard that quite well,\nbut did not know from whence the voice came.  Where are you, asked\nhe.  In the black one, answered thumbling, but the master\ndid not understand what that meant, and went out.\n\nNext morning the cow was killed.  Happily thumbling did not meet\nwith one blow at the cutting up and chopping, he got among\nthe sausage-meat.  And when the butcher came in and began his\nwork, he cried out with all his might, don't chop too deep,\ndon't chop too deep, I am amongst it.  No one heard this because\nof the noise of the chopping-knife.  Now poor thumbling was in\ntrouble, but trouble sharpens the wits, and he sprang out so\nadroitly between the blows that none of them touched him, and\nhe escaped with a whole skin.  But still he could not get away,\nthere was nothing for it but to let himself be thrust into a\nblack-pudding with the bits of bacon.  His quarters there were\nrather confined, and besides that he was hung up in the chimney\nto be smoked, and there time did hang terribly heavy on his hands.\nAt length in winter he was taken down again, as the black-pudding\nhad to be set before a guest.  When the hostess was cutting\nit in slices, he took care not to stretch out his head too\nfar lest a bit of it should be cut off, at last he saw his\nopportunity, cleared a passage for himself, and jumped out.\n\nThe little tailor, however, would not stay any longer in a house\nwhere he fared so ill, so at once set out on his journey again.\nBut his liberty did not last long.  In the open country he met\nwith a fox who snapped him up without thinking.  HI, there,\nmr. Fox, cried\nthe little tailor, it is I who am sticking in your throat, set\nme at liberty again.  You are right, answered the fox.  You\nare next to nothing for me, but if you will promise me the\nfowls in your father's yard I will let you go.  With all my\nheart, replied thumbling.  You shall have all the cocks and hens,\nthat I promise you.  Then the fox let him go again, and himself\ncarried him home.  When the father once more saw his dear son,\nhe willingly gave the fox all the fowls which he had.  For this\nI likewise bring you a handsome bit of money, said thumbling, and\ngave his father the kreuzer which he earned on his travels.\nBut why did the fox get the poor chickens to eat.  Oh, you\nsilly, your father would surely love his child far more than the\nfowls in the yard.\n", "Fitcher's Bird": "There was once a wizard who used to take the form of a poor\nman, and went to houses and begged, and caught pretty girls.\nNo one knew whither he carried them, for they were never\nseen again.  One day he appeared before the door of a man\nwho had three pretty daughters.  He looked like a poor weak\nbeggar, and carried a basket on his back, as if he meant to collect\ncharitable gifts in it.  He begged for a little food, and when\nthe eldest daughter came out and was just handing him a\npiece of bread, he did but touch her, and she was forced to jump\ninto his basket.  Thereupon he hurried off with long strides, and\ncarried her away into a dark forest to his house, which stood\nin the midst of it.  Everything in the house was magnificent.\nHe gave her whatsoever she could possibly desire, and said,\nmy darling, you will certainly be happy with me, for you have\neverything your heart can wish for.  This lasted a few days, and\nthen he said, I must journey forth, and\nleave you alone for a short time.  Here are the keys of the house.\nYou may go everywhere and look at everything except into one\nroom, which this little key opens, and there I forbid you to go\non pain of death.  He likewise gave her an egg and said, preserve\nthe egg carefully for me, and carry it continually about with you,\nfor a great misfortune would arise from the loss of it.\n\nShe took the keys and the egg, and promised to obey him in\neverything.  When he was gone, she went all round the house from the\nbottom to the top, and examined everything.  The rooms shone with\nsilver and gold, and she thought she had never seen such great\nsplendor.  At length she came to the forbidden door.  She wished to\npass it by, but curiosity let her have no rest.  She examined the\nkey, it looked just like any other.  She put it in the keyhole and\nturned it a little, and the door sprang open.  But what did she\nsee when she went in.  A great bloody basin stood in the middle\nof the room, and therein lay human beings, dead and hewn to pieces,\nand hard by was a block of wood, and a gleaming axe lay upon it.\nShe was so terribly alarmed that the egg which she held in her\nhand fell into the basin.  She got it out and wiped the blood off,\nbut in vain, it appeared again in a moment.  She washed and\nscrubbed, but she could not get it off.\n\nIt was not long before the man came back from his journey, and\nthe first things which he asked for were the key and the egg.\nShe gave them to him, but she trembled as she did so, and he saw\nat once by the red spots that she had been in the bloody chamber.\nSince you have gone into the room against my will, said he, you\nshall go back into it against your own.  Your life is ended.\nHe threw her down, dragged her along by her hair, cut her head off\non the block, and hewed her in pieces so that her blood ran on\nthe ground.  Then he threw her into the basin with the rest.\n\nNow I will fetch myself the second, said the wizard, and again he\nwent to the house in the shape of a poor man, and begged.  Then\nthe second daughter brought him a piece of bread.  He caught her\nlike the first, by simply touching her, and carried her away.\nShe did not fare better than her sister.  She allowed herself to be\nled\naway by her curiosity, opened the door of the bloody chamber,\nlooked in, and had to atone for it with her life on the wizard's\nreturn.  Then he went and brought the third sister, but she\nwas clever and wily.  When he had given her the keys and the egg,\nand had left her, she first put the egg away with great care, and\nthen she examined the house, and at last went into the forbidden\nroom.  Alas, what did she behold.  Both her dear sisters lay there\nin the basin, cruelly murdered, and cut into pieces.  But she\nbegan to gather their limbs together and put them in order, head,\nbody, arms and legs.  And when nothing further was wanting the\nlimbs began to move and unite themselves together, and both the\nmaidens opened their eyes and were once more alive.  Then they\nrejoiced and kissed and caressed each other.\n\nOn his arrival, the man at once demanded the keys and the egg,\nand as he could perceive no trace of any blood on it, he said,\nyou have stood the test, you shall be my bride.  He now had\nno longer any power over her, and was forced to do whatsoever\nshe desired.  Oh, very well, said she, you shall first take a\nbasketful of gold to my father and mother, and carry it\nyourself on your back.  In the meantime I will prepare for the\nwedding.  Then she ran to her sisters, whom she had hidden\nin a little chamber, and said, the moment has come when I can\nsave you.  The wretch shall himself carry you home again, but\nas soon as you are at home send help to me.  She put both of\nthem in a basket and covered them quite over with gold, so\nthat nothing of them was to be seen.  Then she called in the\nwizard and said to him, now carry the basket away, but I\nshall look through my little window and watch to see if you\nstop on the way to stand or to rest.\n\nThe wizard raised the basket on his back and went away with\nit, but it weighed him down so heavily that the sweat streamed\nfrom his face.  Then he sat down and wanted to rest awhile, but\nimmediately one of the girls in the basket cried, I am looking\nthrough my little window, and I see that you are resting.\nWill you go on at once.  He thought it was his bride who was\ntalking to\nhim, and he got up on his legs again.  Once more he was going to\nsit down, but instantly she cried, I am looking through my\nlittle window, and I see that you are resting.  Will you go on\ndirectly.  And whenever he stood still, she cried this, and then\nhe was forced to go onwards, until at last, groaning and out\nof breath, he took the basket with the gold and the two\nmaidens into their parents, house.  At home, however, the\nbride prepared the marriage-feast, and sent invitations to the\nfriends of the wizard.  Then she took a skull with grinning\nteeth, put some ornaments on it and a wreath of flowers,\ncarried it upstairs to the garret-window, and let it look out\nfrom thence.  When all was ready, she got into a barrel of\nhoney, and then cut the feather-bed open and rolled herself\nin it, until she looked like a wondrous bird, and no one could\nrecognize her.  Then she went out of the house, and on her\nway she met some of the wedding-guests, who asked,\n          o, fitcher's bird, how com'st thou here.\n          I come from fitcher's house quite near.\n          And what may the young bride be doing.\n          From cellar to garret she's swept all clean,\n          and now from the window she's peeping, I ween.\n\nAt last she met the bridegroom, who was coming slowly back.\nHe, like the others, asked,\n          o, fitcher's bird, how com'st thou here.\n          I come from fitcher's house quite near.\n          And what may the young bride be doing.\n          From cellar to garret she's swept all clean,\n          and now from the window she's peeping, I ween.\n\nThe bridegroom looked up, saw the decked-out skull, thought it\nwas his bride, and nodded to her, greeting her kindly.  But\nwhen he and his guests had all gone into the house, the\nbrothers and kinsmen of the bride, who had been sent to rescue\nher, arrived.  They locked all the doors of the house, that no\none might escape, set fire to it, and the wizard and all his\ncrew had to burn.\n", "The Six Swans": "Once upon a time, a certain king was hunting in a great forest,\nand he chased a wild beast so eagerly that none of his attendants\ncould follow him.  When evening drew near he stopped and looked\naround him, and then he saw that he had lost his way.  He\nsought a way out, but could find none.  Then he perceived an aged\nwoman with a head which nodded perpetually, who came towards\nhim, but she was a witch.  Good woman, said he to her, can\nyou not show me the way through the forest.  Oh, yes, lord\nking, she answered, that I certainly can, but on one condition,\nand if you do not fulfil that, you will never get out of the\nforest, and will die of hunger in it.\n\nWhat kind of condition is it, asked the king.\nI have a daughter, said the old woman, who is as beautiful\nas anyone in the world, and well deserves to be your consort,\nand if you will make her your queen, I will show you the way out\nof the forest.  In the anguish of his heart the king consented,\nand the old woman led him to her little hut, where her daughter\nwas sitting by the fire.  She received the king as if she had been\nexpecting him, and he saw that she was very beautiful, but still\nshe did not please him, and he could not look at her without\nsecret horror.  After he had taken the maiden up on his horse,\nthe old woman showed him\nthe way, and the king reached his royal palace again, where the\nwedding was celebrated.\n\nThe king had already been married once, and had by his first\nwife, seven children, six boys and a girl, whom he loved\nbetter than anything else in the world.  As he now feared that\nthe stepmother might not treat them well, and even do them some\ninjury, he took them to a lonely castle which stood in the\nmidst of a forest.  It lay so concealed, and the way was so\ndifficult to find that he himself would not have found it,\nif a wise woman had not given him a ball of yarn with wonderful\nproperties.  When he threw it down before him, it unrolled\nitself and showed him his path.\n\nThe king, however, went so\nfrequently away to his dear children that the queen observed\nhis absence, she was curious and wanted to know what he did\nwhen he was quite alone in the forest.  She gave a great deal\nof money to his servants, and they betrayed the secret to her,\nand told her likewise of the ball which alone could point out\nthe way.  And now she knew no rest until she had learnt where\nthe king kept the ball of yarn, and then she made little shirts\nof white silk, and as she had learnt the art of witchcraft from\nher mother, she sewed a charm inside them.  And once when the\nking had ridden forth to hunt, she took the little shirts and\nwent into the forest, and the ball showed her the way.\n\nThe\nchildren, who saw from a distance that someone was approaching,\nthought that their dear father was coming to them, and full of\njoy, ran to meet him.  Then she threw one of the little shirts\nover each of them, and no sooner had the shirts touched their\nbodies than they were changed into swans, and flew away over\nthe forest.  The queen went home quite delighted, and thought\nshe had got rid of her step-children, but the girl had not run\nout with her brothers, and the queen knew nothing about her.\n\nNext day the king went to visit his children, but he found\nno one but the little girl.  Where are your brothers, asked\nthe king.  Alas, dear father, she answered, they have gone away\nand left me alone, and she told him that she had seen from\nher little window how her brothers had flown away over the\nforest\nin the shape of swans, and she showed him the feathers, which\nthey had let fall in the courtyard, and which she had picked up.\n\nThe king mourned, but he did not think that the queen had\ndone this wicked deed, and as he feared that the girl would\nalso be stolen away from him, he wanted to take her away with him.\nBut she was afraid of her step-mother, and entreated the king\nto let her stay just this one night more in the forest castle.\n\nThe poor girl thought, I can no longer stay here.  I will go\nand seek my brothers.  And when night came, she ran away, and\nwent straight into the forest.  She walked the whole night long,\nand next day also without stopping, until she could go no farther\nfor weariness.  Then she saw a forest-hut, and went into it, and\nfound a room with six little beds, but she did not venture to\nget into one of them, but crept under one, and lay down on the\nhard ground, intending to pass the night there.  Just before\nsunset, however, she heard a rustling, and saw six swans come\nflying in at the window.  They alighted on the ground and blew\nat each other, and blew all the feathers off, and their swans,\nskins stripped off like a shirt.  Then the maiden looked at them\nand recognized her brothers, was glad and crept forth from beneath\nthe bed.  The brothers were not less delighted to see their\nlittle sister, but their joy was of short duration.  Here you\ncannot abide, they said to her.  This is a shelter for robbers,\nif they come home and find you, they will kill you.  But can you\nnot protect me, asked the little sister.  No, they replied, only\nfor one quarter of an hour each evening can we lay aside our\nswans, skins and have during that time our human form, after\nthat, we are once more turned into swans.\n\nThe little sister\nwept and said, can you not be set free.  Alas, no, they answered,\nthe conditions are too hard.  For six years you may neither\nspeak nor laugh, and in that time you must sew together six\nlittle shirts of starwort for us.  And if one single word falls\nfrom your lips, all your work will be lost.  And when the brothers\nhad said this, the quarter of an hour was over, and they flew\nout of the window again as swans.\n\nThe maiden, however, firmly resolved to deliver her brothers, even\nif it should cost her her life.  She left the hut, went into\nthe midst of the forest, seated herself on a tree, and there\npassed the night.  Next morning she went out and gathered starwort\nand began to sew.  She could not speak to anyone, and she had\nno inclination to laugh, she sat there and looked at nothing\nbut her work.\n\nWhen she had already spent a long time there it\ncame to pass that the king of the country was hunting in the\nforest, and his huntsmen came to the tree on which the maiden\nwas sitting.  They called to her and said, who are you.  But\nshe made no answer.  Come down to us, said they.  We will not\ndo you any harm.  She only shook her head.  As they pressed her\nfurther with questions she threw her golden necklace down to\nthem, and thought to content them thus.  They, however, did\nnot cease, and then she threw her girdle down to them, and as\nthis also was to no purpose, her garters, and by degrees\neverything that she had on that she could do without\nuntil she had nothing left but her shift.\n\nThe huntsmen,\nhowever, did not let themselves be turned aside by that, but\nclimbed the tree and fetched the maiden down and led her before\nthe king.  The king asked, who are you.  What are you doing on the\ntree.  But she did not answer.  He put the question in every\nlanguage that he knew, but she remained as mute as a fish.  As\nshe was so beautiful, the king's heart was touched, and he was\nsmitten with a great love for her.  He put his mantle on her,\ntook her before him on his horse, and carried her to his\ncastle.  Then he caused her to be dressed in rich garments, and\nshe shone in her beauty like bright daylight, but no word\ncould be drawn from her.  He placed her by his side at table, and\nher modest bearing and courtesy pleased him so much that he said,\nshe is the one whom I wish to marry, and no other woman in the\nworld.  And after some days he united himself to her.\n\nThe king, however, had a wicked mother who was dissatisfied\nwith this marriage and spoke ill of the young queen.  Who knows,\nsaid she, from whence the creature who can't speak, comes.\nShe is not worthy of a king.  After a year had passed, when\nthe queen brought her first child into the world, the old\nwoman took it away from her, and smeared her mouth with blood\nas she slept.  Then she went to the king and accused the queen\nof being a man-eater.  The king would not believe it, and would\nnot suffer anyone to do her any injury.  She, however, sat\ncontinually sewing at the shirts, and cared for nothing else.\n\nThe next time, when she again bore a beautiful boy, the false\nmother-in-law used the same treachery, but the king could not\nbring himself to give credit to her words.  He said, she is\ntoo pious and good to do anything of that kind, if she were not\ndumb, and could defend herself, her innocence would come to light.\n\nBut when the old woman stole away the newly-born child for the\nthird time, and accused the queen, who did not utter one word\nof defence, the king could do no otherwise than deliver her over\nto justice, and she was sentenced to suffer death by fire.\n\nWhen the day came for the sentence to be carried out, it was\nthe last day of the six years during which she was not to speak\nor laugh, and she had delivered her dear brothers from the\npower of the enchantment.  The six shirts were ready, only the\nleft sleeve of the sixth was wanting.  When, therefore, she was\nled to the stake, she laid the shirts on her arm, and when she\nstood on high and the fire was just going to be lighted, she\nlooked around and six swans came flying through the air towards\nher.  Then she saw that her deliverance was near, and her heart\nleapt with joy.  The swans swept towards her and sank down so that\nthey were touched by them, their swans, skins fell off, and her\nbrothers stood in their own bodily form before her, and were\nvigorous and handsome.  The youngest only lacked his left arm,\nand had in the place of it a swan's wing on his shoulder.  They\nembraced and kissed each other, and the queen went to the king,\nwho was greatly moved, and she began to speak and said, dearest\nhusband, now I may speak and declare to you that I am innocent,\nand falsely accused.  And she told him of the treachery of the\nold woman who had taken away her three children and hidden them.\n\nThen to the great joy of the king they were brought thither,\nand as a punishment, the wicked mother-in-law was bound to\nthe stake, and burnt to ashes.  But the king and the queen with\nher six brothers lived many years in happiness and peace.\n", "Little Briar-Rose": "\tBriar-Rose\n\nA long time ago there were a king and queen who said every\nday, ah, if only we had a child, but they never had one.  But\nit happened that once when the queen was bathing, a frog\ncrept out of the water on to the land, and said to her, your\nwish shall be fulfilled, before a year has gone by, you shall\nhave a daughter.\n\nWhat the frog had said came true, and the queen had a little\ngirl who was so pretty that the king could not contain himself\nfor joy, and ordered a great feast.  He invited not only his\nkindred, friends and acquaintances, but also the wise women, in\norder that they might be kind and well-disposed towards the\nchild.  There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but, as\nhe had only twelve golden plates for them to eat out of, one\nof them had to be left at home.\n\nThe feast was held with all manner of splendor and when it\ncame to an end the wise women bestowed their magic gifts\nupon the baby - one gave virtue, another beauty, a third\nriches, and so on with everything in the world that one can\nwish for.\n\nWhen eleven of them had made their promises, suddenly the\nthirteenth came in.  She wished to avenge herself for not\nhaving been invited, and without greeting, or even looking\nat anyone, she cried with a loud voice, the king's daughter\nshall in her fifteenth year prick herself with a spindle, and fall\ndown dead.  And, without saying a word more, she turned round\nand left the room.\n\nThey were all shocked, but the twelfth, whose good wish still\nremained unspoken, came forward, and as she could not undo\nthe evil sentence, but only soften it, she said, it shall\nnot be death, but a deep sleep of a hundred years, into which\nthe princess shall fall.\n\nThe king, who would fain keep his dear child from the misfortune,\ngave orders that every spindle in the whole kingdom should\nbe burnt.  Meanwhile the gifts of the wise women were plenteously\nfulfilled on the young girl, for she was so beautiful, modest,\ngood-natured, and wise, that everyone who saw her was bound\nto love her.\n\nIt happened that on the very day when she was fifteen years\nold, the king and queen were not at home, and the maiden\nwas left in the palace quite alone.  So she went round into\nall sorts of places, looked into rooms and bed-chambers just\nas she liked, and at last came to an old tower.  She climbed\nup the narrow winding-staircase, and reached a little door.\nA rusty key was in the lock, and when she turned it the door\nsprang open, and there in a little room sat an old woman with\na spindle, busily spinning her flax.\n\nGood day, old mother, said the king's daughter, what are you\ndoing there.  I am spinning, said the old woman, and nodded\nher head.  What sort of thing is that, that rattles round\nso merrily, said the girl, and she took the spindle and wanted\nto spin too.  But scarcely had she touched the spindle when the\nmagic decree was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it.\n\nAnd, in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell\ndown upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep.\nAnd this sleep extended over the whole palace, the king and\nqueen who had just come home, and had entered the great hall,\nbegan to go to sleep, and the whole of the court with them.\nThe horses, too, went to sleep in the stable, the dogs in\nthe yard, the pigeons upon the roof, the flies on the wall,\neven the fire that was flaming on the hearth became quiet\nand slept, the roast meat left off frizzling, and the\ncook, who was just going to pull the hair of the scullery boy,\nbecause he had forgotten something, let him go, and went to\nsleep.  And the wind fell, and on the trees before the\ncastle not a leaf moved again.\n\nBut round about the castle there began to grow a hedge of\nthorns, which every year became higher, and at last grew\nclose up round the castle and all over it, so that there\nwas nothing of it to be seen, not even the flag upon the\nroof.  But the story of the beautiful sleeping briar-rose,\nfor so the princess was named, went about the country,\nso that from time to time kings' sons came and tried to\nget through the thorny hedge into the castle.\n\nBut they found it impossible, for the thorns held fast\ntogether, as if they had hands, and the youths were caught\nin them, could not get loose again, and died a miserable\ndeath.\n\nAfter long, long years a king's son came again to that\ncountry, and heard an old man talking about the thorn-hedge,\nand that a castle was said to stand behind it in which a\nwonderfully beautiful princess, named briar-rose, had been\nasleep for a hundred years, and that the king and queen and\nthe whole court were asleep likewise.  He had heard, too,\nfrom his grandfather, that many kings, sons had already come,\nand had tried to get through the thorny hedge, but they had\nremained sticking fast in it, and had died a pitiful death.\n\nThen the youth said, I am not afraid, I will go and see\nthe beautiful briar-rose.  The good old man might dissuade him\nas he would, he did not listen to his words.\n\nBut by this time the hundred years had just passed, and the\nday had come when briar-rose was to awake again.  When the\nking's son came near to the thorn-hedge, it was nothing but\nlarge and beautiful flowers, which parted from each other of\ntheir own accord, and let him pass unhurt, then they closed\nagain behind him like a hedge.  In the castle yard he saw the\nhorses and the spotted hounds lying asleep, on the roof sat\nthe pigeons with their heads under their wings.  And when he\nentered the house, the flies were asleep upon the wall, the\ncook in the kitchen was still holding out his hand to seize the\nboy, and the maid was sitting by the black hen which she\nwas going to pluck.\n\nHe went on farther, and in the great hall he saw the whole of\nthe court lying asleep, and up by the throne lay the king and\nqueen.\n\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so quiet that a breath\ncould be heard, and at last he came to the tower, and opened the\ndoor into the little room where briar-rose was sleeping.\n\nThere she lay, so beautiful that he could not turn his eyes away,\nand he stooped down and gave her a kiss.  But as soon as he\nkissed her, briar-rose opened her eyes and awoke, and looked\nat him quite sweetly.\n\nThen they went down together, and the king awoke, and the\nqueen, and the whole court, and looked at each other in\ngreat astonishment.  And the horses in the courtyard stood\nup and shook themselves, the hounds jumped up and wagged their\ntails, the pigeons upon the roof pulled out their heads from\nunder their wings, looked round, and flew into the open\ncountry, the flies on the wall crept again, the fire in the\nkitchen burned up and flickered and cooked the meat, the joint\nbegan to turn and sizzle again, and the cook gave the boy such\na box on the ear that he screamed, and the maid finished\nplucking the fowl.\n\nAnd then the marriage of the king's son with briar-rose was\ncelebrated with all splendor, and they lived contented to the\nend of their days.\n", "King Thrushbeard": "A king had a daughter who was beautiful beyond all measure,\nbut so proud and haughty withal that no suitor was good\nenough for her.  She sent away one after the other, and\nridiculed them as well.\n\nOnce the king made a great feast and invited thereto, from far\nand near, all the young men likely to marry.  They were all\nmarshalled in a row according to their rank and standing.  First\ncame the kings, then the grand-dukes, then the princes, the\nearls, the barons, and the gentry.  Then the king's daughter was\nled through the ranks, but to each one she had some objection\nto make.  One was too fat, the wine-barrel, she said.  Another\nwas too tall, long and thin has little in.  The third was too\nshort, short and thick is never quick.  The fourth was too\npale, as pale as death.  The fifth too red, a fighting cock.\nThe sixth was not straight enough, a green log dried behind\nthe stove.\n\nSo she had something to say against each one, but she made\nherself especially merry over a good king who stood quite\nhigh up in the row, and whose chin had grown a little crooked.\nLook, she cried and laughed, he has a chin like a thrush's\nbeak. And from that time he got the name of king thrushbeard.\n\nBut the old king, when he saw that his daugher did nothing\nbut mock the people, and despised all the suitors who were\ngathered there, was very angry, and swore that she should have\nfor her husband the very first beggar that came to his doors.\n\nA few days afterwards a fiddler came and sang beneath the\nwindows, trying to earn a few pennies.  When the king heard him\nhe said, let him come up.  So the fiddler came in, in his dirty,\nragged clothes, and sang before the king and his daughter, and\nwhen he had ended he asked for a trifling gift.  The king said,\nyour song has pleased me so well that I will give you my\ndaughter there, to wife.\n\nThe king's daughter shuddered, but the king said, I have taken\nan oath to give you to the very first beggar-man and I will keep\nit.  All she could say was in vain.  The priest was brought,\nand she had to let herself be wedded to the fiddler on the\nspot.  When that was done the king said, now it is not proper\nfor you, a beggar-woman, to stay any longer in my palace, you may\njust go away with your husband.\n\nThe beggar-man led her out by the hand, and she was obliged to\nwalk away on foot with him.  When they came to a large forest\nshe asked, to whom does that beautiful forest belong.  It\nbelongs to king thrushbeard.  If you had taken him, it would\nhave been yours.  Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but taken\nking thrushbeard.\n\nAfterwards they came to a meadow, and she asked again, to whom\ndoes this beautiful green meadow belong.  It belongs to king\nthrushbeard.  If you had taken him, it would have been\nyours.  Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but taken king\nthrushbeard.\n\nThen they came to a large town, and she asked again, to whom\ndoes this fine large town belong.  It belongs to king thrushbeard.\nIf you had taken him, it would have been yours.  Ah, unhappy\ngirl that I am, if I had but taken king thrushbeard.\nIt does not please me, said the fiddler, to hear you always\nwishing for another husband.  Am I not good enough for you.\n\nAt last they came to a very little hut, and she said, oh\ngoodness.  What a small house.  To whom does this miserable,\ntiny hovel belong.  The fiddler answered, that is my house and\nyours, where we shall live together.\n\nShe had to stoop in order to go in at the low door.  Where are\nthe servants, said the king's daughter.  What servants, answered\nthe beggar-man.  You must yourself do what you wish to have done.\nJust make a fire at once, and set on water to cook my supper,\nI am quite tired.  But the king's daughter knew nothing about\nlighting fires or cooking, and the beggar-man had to lend a\nhand himself to get anything fairly done.  When they had\nfinished their scanty meal they went to bed.  But he forced\nher to get up quite early in the morning in order to look after\nthe house.\n\nFor a few days they lived in this way as well as might be, and\ncame to the end of all their provisions.  Then the man said,\nwife, we cannot go on any longer eating and drinking here and\nearning nothing.  You must make baskets.  He went out, cut some\nwillows, and brought them home.  Then she began to make baskets,\nbut the tough willows wounded her delicate hands.\n\nI see that this will not do, said the man.  You had better spin,\nperhaps you can do that better.  She sat down and tried to spin,\nbut the hard thread soon cut her soft fingers so that the blood\nran down.  See, said the man, you are fit for no sort of work.\nI have made a bad bargain with you.  Now I will try to make a\nbusiness with pots and earthenware.  You must sit in the\nmarket-place and sell the ware.  Alas, thought she, if any of\nthe people from my father's kingdom come to the market and see\nme sitting there, selling, how they will mock me.  But it was\nof no use, she had to yield unless she chose to die of hunger.\nFor the first time she succeeded well, for the people were glad\nto buy the woman's wares because she was good-looking, and\nthey paid her what she asked.  Many even gave her the money and\nleft the pots with her as well.  So they lived on what she had\nearned as long as it lasted, then the husband bought a lot of\nnew crockery.  With this she sat down at the corner of the\nmarket-place, and set it out round about her ready for sale.\nBut suddenly there came a drunken hussar galloping along, and\nhe rode right amongst the pots so that they were all broken into\na thousand bits.  She began\nto weep, and did now know what to do for fear.  Alas, what will\nhappen to me, cried she.  What will my husband say to this.\nShe ran home and told him of the misfortune.  Who would seat\nherself at a corner of the market-place with crockery, said\nthe man.  Leave off crying, I see very well that you cannot\ndo any ordinary work, so I have been to our king's palace and\nhave asked whether they cannot find a place for a kitchen-maid,\nand they have promised me to take you.  In that way you will\nget your food for nothing.\n\nThe king's daughter was now a kitchen-maid, and had to be at\nthe cook's beck and call, and do the dirtiest work.  In both her\npockets she fastened a little jar, in which she took home her\nshare of the leavings, and upon this they lived.\n\nIt happened that the wedding of the king's eldest son was to be\ncelebrated, so the poor woman went up and placed herself by\nthe door of the hall to look on.  When all the candles were lit,\nand people, each more beautiful than the other, entered, and\nall was full of pomp and splendor, she thought of her lot with\na sad heart, and cursed the pride and haughtiness which had\nhumbled her and brought her to so great poverty.\n\nThe smell of the delicious dishes which were being taken in\nand out reached her, and now and then the servants threw her\na few morsels of them.  These she put in her jars to take home.\n\nAll at once the king's son entered, clothed in velvet and silk,\nwith gold chains about his neck.  And when he saw the\nbeautiful woman standing by the door he seized her by the hand,\nand would have danced with her.  But she refused and shrank\nwith fear, for she saw that it was king thrushbeard, her\nsuitor whom she had driven away with scorn.  Her struggles\nwere of no avail, he drew her into the hall.  But the string\nby which her pockets were hung broke, the pots fell down, the\nsoup ran out, and the scraps were scattered all about.  And\nwhen the people saw it, there arose general laughter and\nderision, and she was so ashamed that she would rather have\nbeen a thousand fathoms below the ground.  She sprang to the\ndoor and would have run away, but on the stairs a man caught\nher and brought her back.  And when she looked at him it was\nking thrushbeard again.  He said to her kindly, do not be\nafraid, I and the fiddler who has been living with you in that\nwretched hovel are one.  For love of you I disguised myself\nso.  And I also was the hussar who rode through your crockery.\nThis was all done to humble your proud spirit, and to punish\nyou for the insolence with which you mocked me.\n\nThen she wept bitterly and said, I have done great wrong, and\nam not worthy to be your wife.  But he said, be comforted,\nthe evil days are past.  Now we will celebrate our wedding.\nThen the maids-in-waiting came and put on her the most splendid\nclothing, and her father and his whole court came and wished\nher happiness in her marriage with king thrushbeard, and\nthe joy now began in earnest.  I wish you and I had been there\ntoo.\n", "Little Snow-White": "\tSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n\nOnce upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of\nsnow were falling like feathers from the sky, a queen sat at\na window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of black\nebony.  And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window\nat the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three\ndrops of blood fell upon the snow.  And the red looked pretty\nupon the white snow, and she thought to herself, would that I had\na child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the\nwood of the window-frame.\n\nSoon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as\nsnow, and as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony,\nand she was therefore called little snow-white.  And when the\nchild was born, the queen died.\n\nAfter a year had passed the king took to himself another wife.\nShe was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could\nnot bear that anyone else chould surpass her in beauty.  She\nhad a wonderful looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it\nand looked at herself in it, and said,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nThe looking-glass answered,\n          thou, o queen, art the fairest of all.\n\nThen she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke\nthe truth.\n\nBut snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful,\nand when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day,\nand more beautiful than the queen herself.  And once when the\nqueen asked her looking-glass,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nIt answered,\n          thou art fairer than all who are here, lady queen.\n          But more beautiful still is snow-white, as I ween.\n\nThen the queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with\nenvy.  From that hour, whenever she looked at snow-white, her\nheart heaved in her breast, she hated the girl so much.\nAnd envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a\nweed, so that she had no peace day or night.  She called a\nhuntsman, and said, take the child away into the forest.  I will\nno longer have her in my sight.  Kill her, and bring me back her\nlung and liver as a token.  The huntsman obeyed, and took her away\nbut when he had drawn his knife, and was about to pierce\nsnow-white's innocent heart, she began to weep, and said, ah dear\nhuntsman, leave me my life.  I will run away into the wild forest,\nand never come home again.\n\nAnd as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and\nsaid, run away, then, you poor child.  The wild beasts will soon\nhave devoured you, thought he, and yet it seemed as if a stone had\nbeen rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for\nhim to kill her.  And as a young bear just then came running by\nhe stabbed it, and cut out its lung and liver and took them to the\nqueen as proof that the child was dead.  The cook had to salt them,\nand the wicked queen ate them, and thought she had eaten the lung\nand liver of snow-white.\n\nBut now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so\nterrified that she looked at all the leaves on the trees, and did\nnot know what to do.  Then she began to run, and ran over sharp\nstones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but\ndid her no harm.\n\nShe ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening,\nthen she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself.\nEverything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than\ncan be told.  There was a table on which was a white cover, and\nseven little plates, and on each plate a little spoon, moreover,\nthere were seven little knives and forks, and seven little mugs.\nAgainst the wall stood seven little beds side by side, and\ncovered with snow-white counterpanes.\n\nLittle snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some\nvegetables and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine\nout of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only.\nThen, as she was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the\nlittle beds, but none of them suited her, one was too long,\nanother too short, but at last she found that the seventh one was\nright, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to\nsleep.\n\nWhen it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back.\nThey were seven dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for\nore.  They lit their seven candles, and as it was now light within\nthe cottage they saw that someone had been there, for everything\nwas not in the same order in which they had left it.\n\nThe first said, who has been sitting on my chair.\nThe second, who has been eating off my plate.\nThe third, who has been taking some of my bread.\nThe fourth, who has been eating my vegetables.\nThe fifth, who has been using my fork.\nThe sixth, who has been cutting with my knife.\nThe seventh, who has been drinking out of my mug.\n\nThen the first looked round and saw that there was a little\nhollow on his bed, and he said, who has been getting into my\nbed.  The others came up and each called out, somebody has been\nlying in my bed too.  But the seventh when he looked at his bed\nsaw little snow-white, who was lying asleep therein.  And he\ncalled the others, who came running up, and they cried out with\nastonishment, and brought their seven little candles and let the\nlight fall on little snow-white.  Oh, heavens, oh, heavens, cried\nthey, what a lovely child.  And they were so glad that they did\nnot wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed.  And the\nseventh dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and\nso passed the night.\n\nWhen it was morning little snow-white awoke, and was frightened\nwhen she saw the seven dwarfs.  But they were friendly and asked\nher what her name was.  My name is snow-white, she answered.\nHow have you come to our house, said the dwarfs.  Then she told\nthem that her step-mother had wished to have her killed, but\nthat the huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run for\nthe whole day, until at last she had found their dwelling.\n\nThe dwarfs said, if you will take care of our house, cook, make\nthe beds, wash, sew and knit, and if you will keep everything neat\nand clean you can stay with us and you shall want for nothing.\nYes, said snow-white, with all my heart.  And she stayed with\nthem.  She kept the house in order for them.  In the mornings\nthey went to the mountains and looked for copper and gold, in the\nevenings they came back, and then their supper had to be ready.\nThe girl was alone the whole day, so the good dwarfs warned her\nand said, beware of your step-mother, she will soon know that you\nare here, be sure to let no one come in.\n\nBut the queen, believing that she had eaten snow-white's lung and\nliver, could not but think that she was again the first and most\nbeautiful of all, and she went to her looking-glass and said,\nlooking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nAnd the glass answered,\n          oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see,\n          but over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,\n          snow-white is still alive and well,\n          and none is so fair as she.\n\nThen she was astounded, for she knew that the looking-glass\nnever spoke falsely, and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed\nher, and that little snow-white was still alive.\n\nAnd so she thought and thought again how she might kill her,\nfor so long as she was not the fairest in the whole land, envy let\nher have no rest.  And when she had at last thought of something\nto do, she painted her face, and dressed herself like an old\npedlar-woman, and no one could have known her.  In this disguise\nshe went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, and\nknocked at the door and cried, pretty things to sell, very cheap,\nvery cheap.  Little snow-white looked out of the window and called\nout, good-day my good woman, what have you to sell.  Good things,\npretty things, she answered, stay-laces of all colors, and she\npulled out one which was woven of bright-colored silk.  I may let\nthe worthy old woman in, thought snow-white, and she unbolted the\ndoor and bought the pretty laces.  Child, said the old woman,\nwhat a fright you look, come, I will lace you properly for once.\nSnow-white had no suspicion, but stood before her, and let herself\nbe laced with the new laces.  But the old woman laced so quickly\nand so tightly that snow-white lost her breath and fell down as\nif dead.  Now I am the most beautiful, said the queen to herself,\nand ran away.\n\nNot long afterwards, in the evening, the seven dwarfs came home,\nbut how shocked they were when they saw their dear little snow-white\nlying on the ground, and that she neither stirred nor\nmoved, and seemed to be dead.  They lifted her up, and, as they\nsaw that she was laced too tightly, they cut the laces, then she\nbegan to breathe a little, and after a while came to life again.\nWhen the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, the old\npedlar-woman was no one\nelse than the wicked queen, take care and let no one come in\nwhen we are not with you.\n\nBut the wicked woman when she had reached home went in front\nof the glass and asked,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nAnd it answered as before,\n          oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see,\n          but over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,\n          snow-white is still alive and well,\n          and none is so fair as she.\n\nWhen she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear,\nfor she saw plainly that little snow-white was again alive.\nBut now, she said, I will think of something that shall really\nput an end to you.  And by the help of witchcraft, which she\nunderstood, she made a poisonous comb.  Then she disguised\nherself and took the shape of another old woman.  So she went\nover the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked at the\ndoor, and cried, good things to sell, cheap, cheap.  Little\nsnow-white looked out and said, go away, I cannot let anyone come\nin.  I suppose you can look, said the old woman, and pulled the\npoisonous comb out and held it up.  It pleased the girl so well\nthat she let herself be beguiled, and opened the door.  When they\nhad made a bargain the old woman said, now I will comb you\nproperly for once.  Poor little snow-white had no suspicion, and\nlet the old woman do as she pleased, but hardly had she put the\ncomb in her hair than the poison in it took effect, and the girl\nfell down senseless.  You paragon of beauty, said the wicked\nwoman, you are done for now, and she went away.\n\nBut fortunately it was almost evening, when the seven dwarfs\ncame home.  When they saw snow-white lying as if dead upon the\nground they at once suspected the step-mother, and they looked\nand found the poisoned comb.  Scarcely had they taken it out when\nsnow-white came to herself, and told them what had happened.\nThen they warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open\nthe door to no one.\n\nThe queen, at home, went in front of the glass and said,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nThen it answered as before,\n          oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see,\n          but over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,\n          snow-white is still alive and well,\n          and none is so fair as she.\n\nWhen she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook\nwith rage.  Snow-white shall die, she cried, even if it costs me\nmy life.\n\nThereupon she went into a quite secret, lonely room, where no\none ever came, and there she made a very poisonous apple.\nOutside it looked pretty, white with a red cheek, so that\neveryone who saw it longed for it, but whoever ate a piece of it\nmust surely die.\n\nWhen the apple was ready she painted her face, and dressed herself\nup as a farmer's wife, and so she went over the seven\nmountains to the seven dwarfs.  She knocked at the door.  Snow-white\nput her head out of the window and said, I cannot let\nanyone in, the seven dwarfs have forbidden me.  It is all the\nsame to me, answered the woman, I shall soon get rid of my apples.\nThere, I will give you one.\n\nNo, said snow-white, I dare not take anything.  Are you afraid\nof poison, said the old woman, look, I will cut the apple in two\npieces, you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.  The\napple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was\npoisoned.  Snow-white longed for the fine apple, and when she saw\nthat the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer, and\nstretched out\nher hand and took the poisonous half.  But hardly had she a bit\nof it in her mouth than she fell down dead.  Then the queen\nlooked at her with a dreadful look, and laughed aloud and said,\nwhite as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood, this time the\ndwarfs cannot wake you up again.\n\nAnd when she asked of the looking-glass at home,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nAnd it answered at last,\n          oh, queen, in this land thou art fairest of all.\nThen her envious heart had rest, so far as an envious heart can\nhave rest.\n\nThe dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found snow-white\nlying upon the ground, she breathed no longer and was dead.\nThey lifted her up, looked to see whether they could find\nanything poisonous, unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her\nwith water and wine, but it was all of no use, the poor child was\ndead, and remained dead.  They laid her upon a bier, and all\nseven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept three days\nlong.\n\nThen they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she\nwere living, and still had her pretty red cheeks.  They said,\nwe could not bury her in the dark ground, and they had a\ntransparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from\nall sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it\nin golden letters, and that she was a king's daughter.  Then they\nput the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always\nstayed by it and watched it.  And birds came too, and wept for\nsnow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.\n\nAnd now snow-white lay a long, long time in the coffin, and she\ndid not change, but looked as if she were asleep, for she was as\nwhite as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as\nebony.\n\nIt happened, however, that a king's son came into the forest, and\nwent to the dwarfs, house to spend the night.  He saw the coffin\non the mountain, and the beautiful snow-white within it, and read\nwhat was written upon it in golden letters.  Then he said to the\ndwarfs, let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want\nfor it.  But the dwarfs answered, we will not part with it for all\nthe gold in the world.  Then he said, let me have it as a gift, for\nI cannot live without seeing snow-white.  I will honor and prize\nher as my dearest possession.  As he spoke in this way the good\ndwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin.\n\nAnd now the king's son had it carried away by his servants on\ntheir shoulders.  And it happened that they stumbled over a\ntree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple\nwhich snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat.  And\nbefore long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin,\nsat up, and was\nonce more alive.  Oh, heavens, where am I, she cried.  The king's\nson, full of joy, said, you are with me.  And told her what had\nhappened, and said, I love you more than everything in the\nworld, come with me to my father's palace, you shall be my wife.\n\nAnd snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding\nwas held with great show and splendor.  But snow-white's\nwicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast.  When she had\narrayed herself in beautiful clothes she went before the\nlooking-glass, and said,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nThe glass answered,\n          oh, queen, of all here the fairest art thou,\n          but the young queen is fairer by far as I trow.\n\nThen the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched,\nso utterly wretched that she knew not what to do.  At first she\nwould not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and\nhad to go to see the young queen.  And when she went in she\nrecognized snow-white, and she stood still with rage and fear,\nand could not stir.  But iron slippers had already been put upon\nthe fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set before\nher.  Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes, and dance\nuntil she dropped down dead.\n", "The Knapsack, the Hat, and the Horn": "There were once three brothers who had fallen deeper and deeper into\npoverty, and at last their need was so great that they had to endure\nhunger, and had nothing to eat or drink. Then said they, it cannot go\non like this, we had better go into the world and seek our fortune.\nThey therefore set out, and had already walked over many a long road\nand many a blade of grass, but had not yet met with good luck.  One\nday they arrived in a great forest, and in the midst of it was a\nhill, and when they came nearer they saw that the hill was all\nsilver.  Then spoke the eldest, now I have found the good luck I\nwished for, and I desire nothing more.  He took as much of the silver\nas he could possibly carry, and then turned back and went home again.\n\nBut the two others said, we want something more from good luck than\nmere silver, and did not touch it, but went onwards.  After they had\nwalked for two days longer without stopping, they came to a hill\nwhich was all gold. The second brother stopped, took thought with\nhimself, and was undecided.  What shall I do, said he, shall I take\nfor myself so much of this gold, that I have sufficient for all the\nrest of my life, or shall I go farther.  At length he made a\ndecision, and putting as much into his pockets as would go in, said\nfarewell to his brother, and went home.\n\nBut the third said, silver and gold do not move me, I will not\nrenounce my chance of fortune, perhaps something better still will be\ngiven me.  He journeyed onwards, and when he had walked for three\ndays, he came to a forest which was still larger than the one before,\nand never would come to an end, and as he found nothing to eat or to\ndrink, he was all but exhausted.  Then he climbed up a high tree to\nfind out if up there he could see the end of the forest, but so far\nas his eye could pierce he saw nothing but the tops of trees.  Then\nhe began to descend the tree again, but hunger tormented him, and he\nthought to himself, if I could but eat my fill once more.\n\nWhen he got down he saw with astonishment a table beneath the tree\nrichly spread with food, the steam of which rose up to meet him.\nThis time, said he, my wish has been fulfilled at the right moment.\nAnd without inquiring who had brought the food, or who had cooked it,\nhe approached the table, and ate with enjoyment until he had appeased\nhis hunger.  When he was done, he thought, it would after all be a\npity if the pretty little table-cloth were to be spoilt in the forest\nhere, and folded it up tidily and put it in his pocket.  Then he went\nonwards, and in the evening, when hunger once more returned to him,\nhe wanted to make a trial of his little cloth, and spread it out and\nsaid, I wish you to be covered with good cheer again, and scarcely\nhad the wish crossed his lips than as many dishes with the most\nexquisite food on them stood on the table as there was room for.  Now\nI perceive, said he, in what kitchen my cooking is done.  You shall\nbe dearer to me than the mountains of silver and gold.  For he saw\nplainly that it was a wishing-cloth. The cloth, however, was still\nnot enough to enable him to sit down quietly at home, he preferred to\nwander about the world and pursue his fortune farther.\n\nOne night he met, in a lonely wood, a dusty, black charcoal-burner,\nwho was burning charcoal there, and had some potatoes by the fire, on\nwhich he was going to make a meal.  Good evening, blackbird, said the\nyouth.  How do you get on in your solitude.\n\nOne day is like another, replied the charcoal-burner, and every night\npotatoes.  Have you a mind to have some, and will you be my guest.\nMany thanks, replied the traveler, I won't rob you of your supper,\nyou did not reckon on a visitor, but if you will put up with what I\nhave, you shall have an invitation. Who is to prepare it for you,\nsaid the charcoal-burner.  I see that you have nothing with you, and\nthere is no one within a two hours' walk who could give you anything.\nAnd yet there shall be a meal, answered the youth, and better than\nany you have ever tasted.  Thereupon he brought his cloth out of his\nknapsack, spread it on the ground, and said, little cloth, cover\nyourself, and instantly boiled meat and baked meat stood there, and\nas hot as if it had just come out of the kitchen.\n\nThe charcoal-burner stared with wide-open eyes, but did not require\nmuch pressing, he fell to, and thrust larger and larger mouthfuls\ninto his black mouth.  When they had eaten everything, the\ncharcoal-burner smiled contentedly, and said, listen, your\ntable-cloth has my approval, it would be a fine thing for me in this\nforest, where no one ever cooks me anything good.  I will propose an\nexchange to you, there in the corner hangs a soldier's knapsack,\nwhich is certainly old and shabby, but in it lie concealed wonderful\npowers, but, as I no longer use it, I will give it to you for the\ntable-cloth.\n\nI must first know what these wonderful powers are, answered the\nyouth.\n\nThat will I tell you, replied the charcoal-burner, every time you tap\nit with your hand, a corporal comes with six men armed from head to\nfoot, and they do whatsover you command them.  So far as I am\nconcerned, said the youth, if nothing else can be done, we will\nexchange, and he gave the charcoal-burner the cloth, took the\nknapsack from the hook, put it on, and bade farewell.  When he had\nwalked a while, he wished to make a trial of the magical powers of\nhis knapsack and tapped it.  Immediately the seven warriors stepped\nup to him, and the corporal said, what does my lord and ruler wish\nfor.\n\nMarch with all speed to the charcoal-burner, and demand my\nwishing-cloth back.  They faced to the left, and it was not long\nbefore they brought what he required, and had taken it from the\ncharcoal-burner without asking many questions.  The young man bade\nthem retire, went onwards, and hoped fortune would shine yet more\nbrightly on him.  By sunset he came to another charcoal-burner, who\nwas making his supper ready by the fire. If you will eat some\npotatoes with salt, but with no dripping, come and sit down with me,\nsaid the sooty fellow.\n\nNo, he replied, this time you shall be my guest, and he spread out\nhis cloth, which was instantly covered with the most beautiful\ndishes.  They ate and drank together, and enjoyed themselves\nheartily.  After the meal was over, the charcoal-burner said, up\nthere on that shelf lies a little old worn-out hat which has strange\nproperties - the moment someone puts it on, and turns it round on his\nhead, the cannons go off as if twelve were fired all together, and\nthey demolish everything so that no one can withstand them.  The hat\nis of no use to me, and I will willingly give it for your tablecloth.\n\nThat suits me very well, he answered, took the hat, put it on, and\nleft his table-cloth behind him.  But hardly had he walked away than\nhe tapped on his knapsack, and his soldiers had to fetch the cloth\nback again.  One thing comes on the top of another, thought he, and I\nfeel as if my luck had not yet come to an end.  Neither had his\nthoughts deceived him.  After he had walked on for the whole of one\nday, he came to a third charcoal-burner, who like the previous one,\ninvited him to potatoes without dripping.  But he let him also dine\nwith him from his wishing-cloth, and the charcoal-burner liked it so\nwell, that at last he offered him a horn for it, which had very\ndifferent properties from those of the hat.  The moment someone blew\nit all the walls and fortifications fell down, and all towns and\nvillages became ruins.  For this he immediately gave the\ncharcoal-burner the cloth, but he afterwards sent his soldiers to\ndemand it back again, so that at length he had the knapsack, hat and\nhorn, all three.  Now, said he, I am a made man, and it is time for\nme to go home and see how my brothers are getting on.\n\nWhen he reached home, his brothers had built themselves a handsome\nhouse with their silver and gold, and were living in clover. He went\nto see them, but as he came in a ragged coat, with his shabby hat on\nhis head, and his old knapsack on his back, they would not\nacknowledge him as their brother.  They mocked and said, you give out\nthat you are our brother who despised silver and gold, and craved for\nsomething still better for himself.  Such a person arrives in his\ncarriage in full splendor like a mighty king, not like a beggar, and\nthey drove him out of doors.  Then he fell into a rage, and tapped\nhis knapsack until a hundred and fifty men stood before him armed\nfrom head to foot.  He commanded them to surround his brothers,\nhouse, and two of them were to take hazelsticks with them, and beat\nthe two insolent men until they knew who he was.\n\nA violent disturbance broke out, people ran together, and wanted to\nlend the two some help in their need, but against the soldiers they\ncould do nothing.  News of this at length came to the king, who was\nvery angry, and ordered a captain to march out with his troop, and\ndrive this disturber of the peace out of the town, but the man with\nknapsack soon got a greater body of men together, who repulsed the\ncaptain and his men, so that they were forced to retire with bloody\nnoses.  The king said, this vagabond is not brought to order yet, and\nnext day sent a still larger troop against him, but they could do\neven less.  The youth set still more men against them, and in order\nto be done the sooner, he turned his hat twice round on his head, and\nheavy guns began to play, and the king's men were beaten and put to\nflight.\n\nAnd now, said he, I will not make peace until the king gives me his\ndaughter to wife, and I govern the whole kingdom in his name.  He\ncaused this to be announced to the king, and the latter said to his\ndaughter, necessity is a hard nut to crack.  What else is there for\nme to do but what he desires.  If I want peace and to keep the crown\non my head, I must give you away.\n\nSo the wedding was celebrated, but the king's daughter was vexed that\nher husband should be a common man, who wore a shabby hat, and put on\nan old knapsack.  She longed to get rid of him, and night and day\nstudied how she could accomplished this.  Then she thought to\nherself, is it possible that his wonderful powers lie in the\nknapsack, and she feigned affection and caressed him, and when his\nheart was softened, she said, if you would but lay aside that horrid\nknapsack, it makes you look so ugly, that I can't help being ashamed\nof you.  Dear child, said he, this knapsack is my greatest treasure,\nas long as I have it, there is no power on earth that I am afraid of.\nAnd he revealed to her the wonderful virtue with which it was\nendowed.\n\nThen she threw herself in his arms as if she were going to kiss him,\nbut cleverly took the knapsack off his shoulders, and ran away with\nit.  As soon as she was alone she tapped it, and commanded the\nwarriors to seize their former master, and take him out of the royal\npalace.  They obeyed, and the false wife sent still more men after\nhim, who were to drive him quite out of the country.  Then he would\nhave been ruined if he had not had the little hat.  And hardly were\nhis hands free before he turned it twice.  Immediately the cannon\nbegan to thunder, and demolished everything, and the king's daughter\nherself was forced to come and beg for mercy.  As she entreated in\nsuch moving terms, and promised to better her ways, he allowed\nhimself to be persuaded and granted her peace.\n\nShe behaved in a friendly manner to him, and acted as if she loved\nhim very much, and after some time managed so to befool him, that he\nconfided to her that even if someone got the knapsack into his power,\nhe could do nothing against him so long as the old hat was still his.\nWhen she knew the secret, she waited until he was asleep, and then\nshe took the hat away from him, and had it thrown out into the\nstreet.  But the horn still remained to him, and in great anger he\nblew it with all his strength.\n\nInstantly all walls, fortifications, towns, and villages, toppled\ndown, and crushed the king and his daughter to death. And had he not\nput down the horn and had blown just a little longer, everything\nwould have been in ruins, and not one stone would have been left\nstanding on another.  Then no one opposed him any longer, and he made\nhimself king of the whole country.\n", "The Golden Bird": "In olden times there was a king, who had behind his palace a\nbeautiful pleasure-garden in which there was a tree that bore golden\napples.  When the apples were getting ripe they were counted, but on\nthe very next morning one was missing.  This was told to the king,\nand he ordered that a watch should be kept every night beneath the\ntree.\n\nThe king had three sons, the eldest of whom he sent, as soon as night\ncame on, into the garden, but when midnight came he could not keep\nhimself from sleeping, and next morning again an apple was gone.\n\nThe following night the second son had to keep watch, but it fared no\nbetter with him, as soon as twelve o'clock had struck he fell asleep,\nand in the morning an apple was gone.\n\nNow it came to the turn of the third son to watch, and he was quite\nready, but the king had not much trust in him, and thought that he\nwould be of less use even than his brothers, but at last he let him\ngo.  The youth lay down beneath the tree, but kept awake, and did not\nlet sleep master him.  When it struck twelve, something rustled\nthrough the air, and in the moonlight he saw a bird coming whose\nfeathers were all shining with gold.\n\nThe bird alighted on the tree, and had just plucked off an apple,\nwhen the youth shot an arrow at him.  The bird flew off, but the\narrow had struck his plumage, and one of his golden feathers fell\ndown.  The youth picked it up, and the next morning took it to the\nking and told him what he had seen in the night.  The king called his\ncouncil together, and everyone declared that a feather like this was\nworth more than the whole kingdom.  If the feather is so precious,\ndeclared the king, one alone will not do for me, I must and will have\nthe whole bird.\n\nThe eldest son set out, and trusting to his cleverness thought that\nhe would easily find the golden bird.  When he had gone some distance\nhe saw a fox sitting at the edge of a wood so he cocked his gun and\ntook aim at him.  The fox cried, do not shoot me, and in return I\nwill give you some good counsel.  You are on the way to the golden\nbird, and this evening you will come to a village in which stand two\ninns opposite to one another.\n\nOne of them is lighted up brightly, and all goes on merrily within,\nbut do not go into it, go rather into the other, even though it looks\nlike a bad one.  How can such a silly beast give wise advice, thought\nthe king's son, and he pulled the trigger. But he missed the fox, who\nstretched out his tail and ran quickly into the wood.\n\nSo he pursued his way, and by evening came to the village where the\ntwo inns were, in one they were singing and dancing, the other had a\npoor, miserable look.  I should be a fool, indeed, he thought, if I\nwere to go into the shabby tavern, and pass by the good one.  So he\nwent into the cheerful one, lived there in riot and revel, and forgot\nthe bird and his father, and all good counsels.\n\nWhen many months had passed, and the eldest son did not come back\nhome, the second set out, wishing to find the golden bird.  The fox\nmet him as he had met the eldest, and gave him the good advice of\nwhich he took no heed.  He came to the two inns, and his brother was\nstanding at the window of the one from which came the music, and\ncalled out to him.  He could not resist, but went inside and lived\nonly for pleasure.\n\nAgain some time passed, and then the king's youngest son wanted to\nset off and try his luck, but his father would not allow it. It is of\nno use, said he, he will find the golden bird still less than his\nbrothers, and if a mishap were to befall him he knows not how to help\nhimself, he's not too bright at the best.  But at last, as he had no\npeace, he let him go.\n\nAgain the fox was sitting outside the wood, and begged for his life,\nand offered his good advice.  The youth was good-natured, and said,\nbe easy, little fox, I will do you no harm.  You shall not repent it,\nanswered the fox, and that you may get on more quickly, get up behind\non my tail.  And scarcely had he seated himself when the fox began to\nrun, and away he went over stock and stone till his hair whistled in\nthe wind.  When they came to the village the youth got off, he\nfollowed the good advice, and without looking round turned into the\nlittle inn, where he spent the night quietly.\n\nThe next morning, as soon as he got into the open country, there sat\nthe fox already, and said, I will tell you further what you have to\ndo.  Go on quite straight, and at last you will come to a castle, in\nfront of which a whole regiment of soldiers is lying, but do not\ntrouble yourself about them, for they will all be asleep and snoring.\nGo through the midst of them staight into the castle, and go through\nall the rooms, till at last you will come to a chamber where a golden\nbird is hanging in a wooden cage.  Close by, there stands an empty\ngold cage for show, but beware of taking the bird out of the common\ncage and putting it into the fine one, or it may go badly with you.\n\nWith these words the fox again stretched out his tail, and the king's\nson seated himself upon it, and away he went over stock and stone\ntill his hair whistled in the wind.\n\nWhen he came to the castle he found everything as the fox had said.\nThe king's son went into the chamber where the golden bird was shut\nup in a wooden cage, whilst a golden one stood by, and the three\ngolden apples lay about the room.  But, thought he, it would be\nabsurd if I were to leave the beautiful bird in the common and ugly\ncage, so he opened the door, laid hold of it, and put it into the\ngolden cage.  But at the same moment the bird uttered a shrill cry.\nThe soldiers awoke, rushed in, and took him off to prison.  The next\nmorning he was taken before a court of justice, and as he confessed\neverything, was sentenced to death.\n\nThe king, however, said that he would grant him his life on one\ncondition - namely, if he brought him the golden horse which ran\nfaster than the wind, and in that case he should receive, over and\nabove, as a reward, the golden bird.\n\nThe king's son set off, but he sighed and was sorrowful, for how was\nhe to find the golden horse.  But all at once he saw his old friend\nthe fox sitting on the road.  Look you, said the fox, this has\nhappened because you did not give heed to me.  However, be of good\ncourage.  I will give you my help, and tell you how to get to the\ngolden horse.  You must go straight on, and you will come to a\ncastle, where in the stable stands the horse.  The grooms will be\nlying in front of the stable, but they will be asleep and snoring,\nand you can quietly lead out the golden horse. But of one thing you\nmust take heed, put on him the common saddle of wood and leather, and\nnot the golden one, which hangs close by, else it will go ill with\nyou.  Then the fox stretched out his tail, the king's son seated\nhimself upon it, and away he went over stock and stone until his hair\nwhistled in the wind.\n\nEverything happened just as the fox had said, the prince came to the\nstable in which the golden horse was standing, but just as he was\ngoing to put the common saddle upon him, he thought, such a beautiful\nbeast will be shamed if I do not give him the good saddle which\nbelongs to him by right.  But scarcely had the golden saddle touched\nthe horse than he began to neigh loudly. The grooms awoke, seized the\nyouth, and threw him into prison.\n\nThe next morning he was sentenced by the court to death, but the king\npromised to grant him his life, and the golden horse as well, if he\ncould bring back the beautiful princess from the golden castle.\n\nWith a heavy heart the youth set out, yet luckily for him he soon\nfound the trusty fox.  I ought only to leave you to your ill-luck,\nsaid the fox, but I pity you, and will help you once more out of your\ntrouble.  This road takes you straight to the golden castle, you will\nreach it by eventide, and at night when everything is quiet the\nbeautiful princess goes to the bathing-house to bathe. When she\nenters it, run up to her and give her a kiss, then she will follow\nyou, and you can take her away with you, only do not allow her to\ntake leave of her parents first, or it will go ill with you.\n\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, the king's son seated himself\nupon it, and away went the fox, over stock and stone, till his hair\nwhistled in the wind.\n\nWhen he reached the golden castle it was just as the fox had said. He\nwaited until midnight, when everything lay in deep sleep, and the\nbeautiful princess was going to the bathing-house. Then he sprang out\nand gave her a kiss.  She said that she would like to go with him,\nbut she asked him pitifully, and with tears, to allow her first to\ntake leave of her parents.  At first he withstood her prayer, but\nwhen she wept more and more, and fell at his feet, he at last gave\nin.  But no sooner had the maiden reached the bedside of her father\nthan he and all the rest in the castle awoke, and the youth was laid\nhold of and put into prison.\n\nThe next morning the king said to him, your life is forfeited, and\nyou can only find mercy if you take away the hill which stands in\nfront of my windows, and prevents my seeing beyond it, and you must\nfinish it all within eight days.  If you do that you shall have my\ndaughter as your reward.\n\nThe king's son began, and dug and shoveled without stopping, but when\nafter seven days he saw how little he had done, and how all his work\nwas as good as nothing, he fell into great sorrow and gave up all\nhope.  But on the evening of the seventh day the fox appeared and\nsaid, you do not deserve that I should take my trouble about you, but\njust go away and lie down to sleep, and I will do the work for you.\n\nThe next morning when he awoke and looked out of the window the hill\nhad gone.  The youth ran, full of joy, to the king, and told him that\nthe task was fulfilled, and whether he liked it or not, the king had\nto hold to his word and give him his daughter.\n\nSo the two set forth together, and it was not long before the trusty\nfox came up with them.  You have certainly got what is best, said he,\nbut the golden horse also belongs to the maiden of the golden castle.\nHow shall I get it, asked the youth. That I will tell you, answered\nthe fox, first take the beautiful maiden to the king who sent you to\nthe golden castle.  There will be unheard-of rejoicing, they will\ngladly give you the golden horse, and will bring it out to you.\nMount it as soon as possible, and offer your hand to all in farewell,\nlast of all to the beautiful maiden.  And as soon as you have taken\nher hand swing her up on to the horse, and gallop away, and no one\nwill be able to bring you back, for the horse runs faster than the\nwind.\n\nAll was carried out successfully, and the king's son carried off the\nbeautiful princess on the golden horse.\n\nThe fox did not remain behind, and he said to the youth, now I will\nhelp you to get the golden bird.  When you come near to the castle\nwhere the golden bird is to be found, let the maiden get down, and I\nwill take her into my care.  Then ride with the golden horse into the\ncastle-yard, there will be great rejoicing at the sight, and they\nwill bring out the golden bird for you.  As soon as you have the cage\nin your hand gallop back to us, and take the maiden away again.\n\nWhen the plan had succeeded, and the king's son was about to ride\nhome with his treasures, the fox said, now you shall reward me for my\nhelp.  What do you require for it, asked the youth.  When you get\ninto the wood yonder, shoot me dead, and chop off my head and feet.\n\nThat would be fine gratitude, said the king's son.  I cannot possibly\ndo that for you.\n\nThe fox said, if you will not do it I must leave you, but before I go\naway I will give you a piece of good advice.  Be careful about two\nthings.  Buy no gallows'-flesh, and do not sit at the edge of any\nwell.  And then he ran into the wood.\n\nThe youth thought, that is a wonderful beast, he has strange whims,\nwho on earth would want to buy gallows'-flesh.  As for the desire to\nsit at the edge of a well it has never yet occurred to me.\n\nHe rode on with the beautiful maiden, and his road took him again\nthrough the village in which his two brothers had remained. There was\na great stir and noise, and, when he asked what was going on, he was\ntold that two men were going to be hanged.  As he came nearer to the\nplace he saw that they were his brothers, who had been playing all\nkinds of wicked pranks, and had squandered all their wealth.  He\ninquired whether they could not be set free.  If you will pay for\nthem, answered the people, but why should you waste your money on\nwicked men, and buy them free. He did not think twice about it, but\npaid for them, and when they were set free they all went on their way\ntogether.\n\nThey came to the wood where the fox had first met them, and as it was\na hot day, but cool and pleasant within the wood, the two brothers\nsaid, let us rest a little by the well, and eat and drink.  He\nagreed, and whilst they were talking he forgot himself, and sat down\nupon the edge of the well without thinking of any evil.  But the two\nbrothers threw him backwards into the well, took the maiden, the\nhorse, and the bird, and went home to their father.  Here we bring\nyou not only the golden bird, said they, we have won the golden horse\nalso, and the maiden from the golden castle.  Then was there great\njoy, but the horse would not eat, the bird would not sing, and the\nmaiden sat and wept.\n\nBut the youngest brother was not dead.  By good fortune the well was\ndry, and he fell upon soft moss without being hurt, but he could not\nget out again.  Even in this strait the faithful fox did not leave\nhim, it came and leapt down to him, and upbraided him for having\nforgotten its advice.  But yet I cannot give up, he said, I will help\nyou up again into daylight.  He bade him grasp his tail and keep\ntight hold of it, and then he pulled him up. You are not out of all\ndanger yet, said the fox.  Your brothers were not sure of your death,\nand have surrounded the wood with watchers, who are to kill you if\nyou let yourself be seen.  But a poor man was sitting upon the road,\nwith whom the youth changed clothes, and in this way he got to the\nking's palace.\n\nNo one knew him, but the bird began to sing, the horse began to eat,\nand the beautiful maiden left off weeping.  The king, astonished,\nasked, what does this mean.  Then the maiden said, I do not know, but\nI have been so sorrowful and now I am so happy.  I feel as if my true\nbridegroom had come.  She told him all that had happened, although\nthe other brothers had threatened her with death if she were to\nbetray anything.\n\nThe king commanded that all people who were in his castle should be\nbrought before him, and amongst them came the youth in his ragged\nclothes, but the maiden knew him at once and fell upon his neck.  The\nwicked brothers were seized and put to death, but he was married to\nthe beautiful maiden and declared heir to the king.\n\nBut what happened to the poor fox.  Long afterwards the king's son\nwas once again walking in the wood, when the fox met him and said,\nyou have everything now that you can wish for, but there is never an\nend to my misery, and yet it is in your power to free me, and again\nhe asked him with tears to shoot him dead and chop off his head and\nfeet.  So he did it, and scarcely was it done when the fox was\nchanged into a man, and was no other than the brother of the\nbeautiful princess, who at last was freed from the magic charm which\nhad been laid upon him.  And now they had all the happiness they\nwanted as long as they lived.\n", "The Two Brothers": "There were once upon a time two brothers, one rich and the other\npoor.  The rich one was a goldsmith and evil-hearted. The poor one\nsupported himself by making brooms, and was good and honorable.  He\nhad two children, who were twin brothers and as like each other as\ntwo drops of water.  The two boys went in and out of the rich house,\nand often got some of the scraps to eat.  It happened once when the\npoor man was going into the forest to fetch brush-wood, that he saw a\nbird which was quite golden and more beautiful than any he had ever\nchanced to meet with.  He picked up a small stone, threw it at it,\nand was lucky enough to hit it, but one golden feather only fell\ndown, and the bird flew away.  The man took the feather and carried\nit to his brother, who looked at it and said, it is pure gold. And\ngave him a great deal of money for it.  Next day the man climbed into\na birch-tree, and was about to cut off a couple of branches when the\nsame bird flew out, and when the man searched he found a nest, and an\negg lay inside it, which was of gold.  He took the egg home with him,\nand carried it to his brother, who again said, it is pure gold, and\ngave him what it was worth.  At last the goldsmith said, I should\nindeed like to have the bird itself.  The poor man went into the\nforest for the third time, and again saw the golden bird sitting on\nthe tree, so he took a stone and brought it down and carried it to\nhis brother, who gave him a great heap of gold for it.  Now I can get\non, thought he, and went contentedly home.\n\nThe goldsmith was crafty and cunning, and knew very well what kind of\na bird it was.  He called his wife and said, roast me the gold bird,\nand take care that none of it is lost.  I have a fancy to eat it all\nmyself.  The bird, however, was no common one, but of so wondrous a\nkind that whosoever ate its heart and liver found every morning a\npiece of gold beneath his pillow.  The woman prepared the bird, put\nit on the spit, and let it roast.  Now it happened that while it was\non the fire, and the woman was forced to go out of the kitchen on\naccount of some other work, the two children of the poor broom-maker\nran in, stood by the spit and turned it round once or twice.  And as\nat that very moment two little bits of the bird fell down into the\npan, one of the boys said, we will eat these two little bits.  I am\nso hungry, and no one will ever miss them.  Then the two ate the\npieces, but the woman came into the kitchen and saw that they were\neating something and said, what have you been eating.  Two little\nmorsels which fell out of the bird, answered they.  That must have\nbeen the heart and the liver, said the woman, quite frightened, and\nin order that her husband might not miss them and be angry, she\nquickly killed a young cock, took out his heart and liver, and put\nthem beside the golden bird.  When it was ready, she carried it to\nthe goldsmith, who consumed it all alone, and left none of it.  Next\nmorning, however, when he felt beneath his pillow, and expected to\nbring out the piece of gold, no more gold pieces were there than\nthere had always been.\n\nThe two children did not know what a piece of good-fortune had fallen\nto their lot.  Next morning when they arose, something fell rattling\nto the ground, and when they picked it up there were two gold pieces.\nThey took them to their father, who was astonished and said, how can\nthat have happened.  When next morning they again found two, and so\non daily, he went to his brother and told him the strange story.  The\ngoldsmith at once knew how it had happened, and that the children had\neaten the heart and liver of the golden bird, and in order to revenge\nhimself, and because he was envious and hard-hearted, he said to the\nfather, your children are in league with the evil one, do not take\nthe gold, and do not suffer them to stay any longer in your house,\nfor he has them in his power, and may ruin you likewise.  The father\nfeared the evil one, and painful as it was to him, he nevertheless\nled the twins forth into the forest, and with a sad heart left them\nthere.\n\nAnd now the two children ran about the forest, and sought the way\nhome again, but could not find it, and only lost themselves more and\nmore.  At length they met with a huntsman, who asked, to whom do you\nchildren belong.  We are the poor broom-maker's boys, they replied,\nand they told him that their father would not keep them any longer in\nthe house because a piece of gold lay every morning under their\npillows.  Come, said the huntsman, that is nothing so very bad, if at\nthe same time you remain honest, and are not idle.  As the good man\nliked the children, and had none of his own, he took them home with\nhim and said, I will be your father, and bring you up till you are\nbig.  They learnt huntsmanship from him, and the piece of gold which\neach of them found when he awoke, was kept for them by him in case\nthey should need it in the future.\n\nWhen they were grown up, their foster-father one day took them into\nthe forest with him, and said, to-day shall you make your trial shot,\nso that I may release you from your apprenticeship, and make you\nhuntsmen.  They went with him to lie in wait and stayed there a long\ntime, but no game appeared.  The huntsman, however, looked above him\nand saw a covey of wild geese flying in the form of a triangle, and\nsaid to one of them,  shoot me down one from each corner.  He did it,\nand thus accomplished his trial shot.\n\nSoon after another covey came flying by in the form of the figure\ntwo, and the huntsman bade the other also bring down one from each\ncorner, and his trial shot was likewise successful.  Now, said the\nfoster-father, I pronounce you out of your apprenticeship.  You are\nskilled huntsmen.  Thereupon the two brothers went forth together\ninto the forest, and took counsel with each other and planned\nsomething.  And in the evening when they had sat down to supper, they\nsaid to their foster-father, we will not touch food, or take one\nmouthful, until you have granted us a request.  Said he, what, then,\nis your request.  They replied, we have now finished learning, and we\nmust prove ourselves in the world, so allow us to go away and travel.\nThen spoke the old man joyfully, you talk like brave huntsmen, that\nwhich you desire has been my wish.  Go forth, all will go well with\nyou.  Thereupon they ate and drank joyously together.\n\nWhen the appointed day came, their foster-father presented each of\nthem with a good gun and a dog, and let each of them take as many of\nhis saved-up gold pieces as he chose.  Then he accompanied them a\npart of the way, and when taking leave, he gave them a bright knife,\nand said, if ever you separate, stick this knife into a tree at the\nplace where you part, and when one of you returns, he will will be\nable to see how his absent brother is faring, for the side of the\nknife which is turned in the direction by which he went, will rust if\nhe dies, but will remain bright as long as he is alive.  The two\nbrothers went still farther onwards, and came to a forest which was\nso large that it was impossible for them to get out of it in one day.\nSo they passed the night in it, and ate what they had put in their\nhunting-pouches, but they walked all the second day likewise, and\nstill did not get out.  As they had nothing to eat, one of them said,\nwe must shoot something for ourselves or we shall suffer from hunger,\nand loaded his gun, and looked about him.  And when an old hare came\nrunning up towards them, he laid his gun on his shoulder, but the\nhare cried,\n     dear huntsman, do but let me live,\n     two little ones to thee I'll give,\nand sprang instantly into the thicket, and brought two young ones.\n\nBut the little creatures played so merrily, and were so pretty, that\nthe huntsmen could not find it in their hearts to kill them.  They\ntherefore kept them with them, and the little hares followed on foot.\nSoon after this, a fox crept past.  They were just going to shoot it,\nbut the fox cried,\n     dear hunstman, do but let me live,\n     two little ones to thee I'll give.\n\nHe, too, brought two little foxes, and the huntsmen did not like to\nkill them either, but gave them to the hares for company, and they\nfollowed behind.  It was not long before a wolf strode out of the\nthicket.  The huntsmen made ready to shoot him, but the wolf cried,\n     dear huntsman, do but let me live,\n     two little ones to thee I'll give.\n\nThe huntsman put the two wolves beside the other animals, and they\nfollowed behind them.  Then a bear came who wanted to trot about a\nlittle longer, and cried,\n     dear huntsman, do but let me live,\n     two little ones to thee I'll give.\n\nThe two young bears were added to the others, and there were already\neight of them.  Then who should come.  A lion came, and tossed his\nmane.  But the huntsmen did not let themselves be frightened and\naimed at him likewise, but the lion also said,\n     dear huntsman, do but let me live,\n     two little ones to thee I'll give.\n\nAnd he brought his little ones to them, and now the huntsmen had two\nlions, two bears, two wolves, two foxes, and two hares, who followed\nthem and served them.  In the meantime their hunger was not appeased\nby this, and they said to the foxes, listen you sneakers, provide us\nwith something to eat.  You are crafty and cunning.  They replied,\nnot far from here lies a village, from which we have already brought\nmany a fowl.  We will show you the way there.  So they went into the\nvillage, bought themselves something to eat, had some food given to\ntheir beasts, and then traveled onwards.  The foxes knew their way\nvery well about the district and where the poultry-yards were, and\nwere were able to guide the huntsmen.\n\nNow they traveled about for a while, but could find no situation\nwhere they could remain together, so they said, there is nothing else\nfor it, we must part.  They divided the animals, so that each of them\nhad a lion, a bear, a wolf, a fox, and a hare, then they took leave\nof each other, promised to love each other like brothers till their\ndeath, and stuck the knife which their foster-father had given them,\ninto a tree, after which one went east and the other went west.\n\nThe younger, however, arrived with his beasts in a town which was all\nhung with black crape.  He went into an inn, and asked the host if he\ncould accommodate his animals.  The innkeeper gave him a stable,\nwhere there was a hole in the wall, and the hare crept out and\nfetched himself the head of a cabbage, and the fox fetched himself a\nhen, and when he had devoured it got the cock as well, but the wolf,\nthe bear, and the lion could not get out because they were too big.\nThen the innkeeper let them be taken to a place where a cow happened\nto be lying on the grass, that they might eat till they were\nsatisfied.  And when the huntsman had taken care of his animals, he\nasked the innkeeper why the town was thus hung with black crape.\nSaid the host, because our king's only daughter is to die to-morrow.\nThe huntsman inquired, is she sick unto death.  No, answered the\nhost, she is vigorous and healthy, nevertheless she must die.  How is\nthat, asked the huntsman.\n\nThere is a high hill without the town, whereon dwells a dragon who\nevery year must have a pure virgin, or he lays the whole country\nwaste, and now all the maidens have already been given to him, and\nthere is no longer anyone left but the king's daughter, yet there is\nno mercy for her.  She must be given up to him, and that is to be\ndone to-morrow.  Said the huntsman, why is the dragon not killed.\nAh, replied the host, so many knights have tried it, but it has cost\nall of them their lives.  The king has promised that he who conquers\nthe dragon shall have his daughter to wife, and shall likewise govern\nthe kingdom after his own death.\n\nThe huntsman said nothing more to this, but next morning took his\nanimals, and with them ascended the dragon's hill.  A little church\nstood at the top of it, and on the altar three full cups were\nstanding, with the inscription.  Whosoever empties the cups will\nbecome the strongest man on earth, and will be able to wield the\nsword which is buried before the threshold of the door.  The huntsman\ndid not drink, but went out and sought for the sword in the ground,\nbut was unable to move it from its place.  Then he went in and\nemptied the cups, and now he was strong enough to take up the sword,\nand his hand could quite easily wield it.  As the hour came when the\nmaiden was to be delivered over to the dragon, the king, the marshal,\nand courtiers accompanied her.  From afar she saw the huntsman on the\ndragon's hill, and thought it was the dragon standing there waiting\nfor her, and did not want to go up to him, but at last, because\notherwise the whole town would have been destroyed, she was forced to\ntake the fatal journey.  The king and courtiers returned home full of\ngrief.  The king's marshal, however, was to stand still, and see all\nfrom a distance.\n\nWhen the king's daughter got to the top of the hill, it was not the\ndragon which stood there, but the young huntsman, who comforted her,\nand said he would save her, led her into the church, and locked her\nin.  It was not long before the seven-headed dragon came thither with\nloud roaring.  When he perceived the huntsman, he was astonished and\nsaid, what business have you here on the hill.  The huntsman\nanswered, I want to fight with you.  Said the dragon,  many knights\nhave left their lives here, I shall soon have made an end of you too,\nand he breathed fire out of seven jaws.\n\nThe fire was to have lighted the dry grass, and the huntsman was to\nhave been suffocated in the heat and smoke, but the animals came\nrunning up and trampled out the fire.  Then the dragon rushed upon\nthe huntsman, but he swung his sword until it sang through the air,\nand struck off three of his heads.  Then the dragon grew really\nfurious, and rose up in the air, and spat out flames of fire over the\nhuntsman, and was about to plunge down on him, but the huntsman once\nmore drew out his sword, and again cut off three of his heads.  The\nmonster became faint and sank down.\n\nNevertheless it was just able to rush upon the huntsman, when he with\nhis last strength smote its tail off, and as he could fight no\nlonger, called up his animals who tore it in pieces.  When the\nstruggle was ended, the huntsman unlocked the church, and found the\nking's daughter lying on the floor, as she had lost her senses with\nanguish and terror during the contest.  He carried her out, and when\nshe came to herself once more, and opened her eyes, he showed her the\ndragon all cut to pieces, and told her that she was now set free. She\nrejoiced and said, now you will be my dearest husband, for my father\nhas promised me to him who kills the dragon.  Thereupon she took off\nher necklace of coral, and divided it amongst the animals in order to\nreward them, and the lion received the golden clasp.  Her\npocket-handkerchief, however, on which was her name, she gave to the\nhuntsman, who went and cut the tongues out of the dragons, seven\nheads, wrapped them in the handkerchief, and preserved them\ncarefully.\n\nThat done, as he was so faint and weary with the fire and the battle,\nhe said to the maiden, we are both faint and weary, we will sleep\nawhile.  Then she said, yes, and they lay down on the ground, and the\nhuntsman said to the lion, you shall keep watch, that no one\nsurprises us in our sleep, and both fell asleep.  The lion lay down\nbeside them to watch, but he also was so weary with the fight, that\nhe called to the bear and said, lie down near me, I must sleep a\nlittle.  If anything comes, waken me.  Then the bear lay down beside\nhim, but he also was tired, and called the wolf and said, lie down by\nme, I must sleep a little, but if anything comes, waken me.  Then the\nwolf lay down by him, but he was tired likewise, and called the fox\nand said, lie down by me, I must sleep a little, if anything comes\nwaken me.  Then the fox lay down beside him, but he too was weary,\nand called the hare and said, lie down near me, I must sleep a\nlittle, and if anything should come, waken me.  Then the hare sat\ndown by him, but the poor hare was tired too, and had no one whom he\ncould call there to keep watch, and fell asleep.  And now the king's\ndaughter, the huntsman, the lion, the bear, the wolf, the fox, and\nthe hare, were all sleeping a sound sleep.  The marshal, however, who\nwas to look on from a distance, took courage when he did not see the\ndragon flying away with the maiden, and finding that all the hill had\nbecome quiet, ascended it.\n\nThere lay the dragon hacked and hewn to pieces on the ground, and not\nfar from it were the king's daughter and a huntsman with his animals,\nand all of them were sunk in a sound sleep.  And as he was wicked and\ngodless he took his sword, cut off the huntsman's head, and seized\nthe maiden in his arms, and carried her down the hill.  Then she\nawoke and was terrified, but the marshal said, you are in my hands,\nyou shall say that it was I who killed the dragon.\n\nI cannot do that, she replied, for it was a huntsman with his animals\nwho did it.  Then he drew his sword, and threatened to kill her if\nshe did not obey him, and so compelled her that she promised it.\nThen he took her to the king, who did not know how to contain himself\nfor joy when he once more looked on his dear child in life, whom he\nhad believed to have been torn to pieces by the monster.  The marshal\nsaid to him, I have killed the dragon, and delivered the maiden and\nthe whole kingdom as well, therefore I demand her as my wife, as was\npromised.  The king said to the maiden, is what he says true.  Ah,\nyes, she answered, it must indeed be true, but I will not consent to\nhave the wedding celebrated until after a year and a day, for she\nthought in that time she should hear something of her dear huntsman.\n\nThe animals, however, were still lying sleeping beside their dead\nmaster on the dragon's hill, and there came a great bumble-bee and\nlighted on the hare's nose, but the hare wiped it off with his paw,\nand went on sleeping.  The bumble-bee came a second time, but the\nhare again rubbed it off and slept on.  Then it came for the third\ntime, and stung his nose so that he awoke.  As soon as the hare was\nawake, he roused the fox, and the fox, the wolf, and the wolf the\nbear, and the bear the lion.  And when the lion awoke and saw that\nthe maiden was gone, and his master was dead, he began to roar\nfrightfully and cried, who has done that.  Bear, why did you not\nwaken me.  The bear asked the wolf, why did you not waken me.  And\nthe wolf the fox, why did you not waken me.  And the fox the hare,\nwhy did you not waken me.  The poor hare alone did not know what\nanswer to make, and the blame rested with him.  Then they were just\ngoing to fall upon him, but he entreated them and said, kill me not,\nI will bring our master to life again.  I know a mountain on which a\nroot grows which, when placed in the mouth of anyone, cures him of\nall illness and every wound.  But the mountain lies two hundred\nhours, journey from here.\n\nThe lion said, in four-and-twenty hours must you have run thither and\nhave come back, and have brought the root with you. Then the hare\nsprang away, and in four-and-twenty hours he was back, and brought\nthe root with him.  The lion put the huntsman's head on again, and\nthe hare placed the root in his mouth, and immediately everything\nunited together again, and his heart beat, and life came back.  Then\nthe huntsman awoke, and was alarmed when he did not see the maiden,\nand thought, she must have gone away whilst I was sleeping, in order\nto get rid of me.  The lion in his great haste had put his master's\nhead on the wrong way round, but the huntsman did not observe it\nbecause of his melancholy thoughts about the king's daughter.  But at\nnoon, when he was going to eat something, he saw that his head was\nturned backwards and could not understand it, and asked the animals\nwhat had happened to him in his sleep.  Then the lion told him that\nthey, too, had all fallen asleep from weariness, and on awaking, had\nfound him dead with his head cut off, that the hare had brought the\nlife-giving root, and that he, in his haste, had laid hold of the\nhead the wrong way, but that he would repair his mistake.  Then he\ntore the huntsman's head off again, turned it round, and the hare\nhealed it with the root.\n\nThe huntsman, however, was sad at heart, and traveled about the\nworld, and made his animals dance before people.  It came to pass\nthat precisely at the end of one year he came back to the same town\nwhere he had rescued the king's daughter from the dragon, and this\ntime the town was gaily hung with red cloth.  Then he said to the\nhost, what does this mean.  Last year the town was all hung with\nblack crape, what means the red cloth to-day.  The host answered,\nlast year our king's daughter was to have been delivered over to the\ndragon, but the marshal fought with it and killed it, and so\nto-morrow their wedding is to be solemnized, and that is why the town\nwas then hung with black crape for mourning, and is to-day covered\nwith red cloth for joy.\n\nNext day when the wedding was to take place, the huntsman said at\nmid-day to the inn-keeper, do you believe, sir host, that I while\nwith you here to-day shall eat bread from the king's own table.\n\nNay, said the host, I would bet a hundred pieces of gold that that\nwill not come true.  The huntsman accepted the wager, and set against\nit a purse with just the same number of gold pieces. Then he called\nthe hare and said, go, my dear runner, and fetch me some of the bread\nwhich the king is eating.  Now the little hare was the lowest of the\nanimals, and could not transfer this order to any the others, but had\nto get on his legs himself.  Alas. Thought he, if I bound through the\nstreets thus alone, the butchers, dogs will all be after me.  It\nhappened as he expected, and the dogs came after him and wanted to\nmake holes in his good skin.  But he sprang away, you have never seen\nthe like, and sheltered himself in a sentry-box without the soldier\nbeing aware of it.  Then the dogs came and wanted to have him out,\nbut the soldier did not understand a jest, and struck them with the\nbutt-end of his gun, till they ran away yelling and howling.  As soon\nas the hare saw that the way was clear, he ran into the palace and\nstraight to the king's daughter, sat down under her chair, and\nscratched at her foot.  Then she said, will you get away, and thought\nit was her dog.  The hare scratched her foot for the second time, and\nshe again said, will you get away, and thought it was her dog.  But\nthe hare did not let itself be turned from its purpose, and scratched\nher for the third time.  Then she peeped down, and knew the hare by\nits collar.\n\nShe took him on her lap, carried him into her chamber, and said, dear\nhare, what do you want.  He answered, my master, who killed the\ndragon, is here, and has sent me to ask for a loaf of bread like that\nwhich the king eats.  Then she was full of joy and had the baker\nsummoned, and ordered him to bring a loaf such as was eaten by the\nking.  The little hare said, but the baker must likewise carry it\nthither for me, that the butchers, dogs may do no harm to me.  The\nbaker carried if for him as far as the door of the inn, and then the\nhare got on his hind legs, took the loaf in his front paws, and\ncarried it to his master.  Then said the huntsman, behold, sir host,\nthe hundred pieces of gold are mine.  The host was astonished, but\nthe huntsman went on to say, yes, sir host, I have the bread, but now\nI will likewise have some of the king's roast meat.\n\nThe host said, I should indeed like to see that, but he would make no\nmore wagers.  The huntsman called the fox and said, my little fox, go\nand fetch me some roast meat, such as the king eats.\n\nThe red fox knew the byways better, and went by holes and corners\nwithout any dog seeing him, seated himself under the chair of the\nking's daughter, and scratched her foot.  Then she looked down and\nrecognized the fox by its collar, took him into her chamber with her\nand said, dear fox, what do you want.  He answered, my master, who\nkilled the dragon, is here, and has sent me.  I am to ask for some\nroast meat such as the king is eating.  Then she made the cook come,\nwho was obliged to prepare a roast joint, the same as was eaten by\nthe king, and to carry it for the fox as far as the door.  Then the\nfox took the dish, waved away with his tail the flies which had\nsettled on the meat, and then carried it to his master.  Behold, sir\nhost, said the huntsman, bread and meat are here but now I will also\nhave proper vegetables with it, such as are eaten by the king.  Then\nhe called the wolf, and said, dear wolf, go thither and fetch me\nvegetables such as the king eats.\n\nThen the wolf went straight to the palace, as he feared no one, and\nwhen he got to the king's daughter's parlor, he tugged at the back of\nher dress, so that she was forced to look round.  She recognized him\nby his collar, and took him into her chamber with her, and said, dear\nwolf, what do you want.  He answered, my master, who killed the\ndragon, is here, I am to ask for some vegetables, such as the king\neats.  Then she made the cook come, and he had to make ready a dish\nof vegetables, such as the king ate, and had to carry it for the wolf\nas far as the door, and then the wolf took the dish from him, and\ncarried it to his master.  Behold, sir host, said the huntsman, now I\nhave bread and meat and vegetables, but I will also have some pastry\nto eat like that which the king eats.  He called the bear, and said,\ndear bear, you are fond of licking anything sweet, go and bring me\nsome confectionery, such as the king eats.\n\nThe the bear trotted to the palace, and everyone got out of his way,\nbut when he went to the guard, they presented their muskets, and\nwould not let him go into the royal palace.  But he got up on his\nhind legs, and gave them a few boxes on the ears, right and left,\nwith his paws, so that the whole watch broke up, and then he went\nstraight to the king's daughter, placed himself behind her, and\ngrowled a little.  Then she looked behind her, knew the bear, and\nbade him go into her room with her, and said, dear bear, what do you\nwant.  He answered, my master, who killed the dragon, is here, and I\nam to ask for some confectionery such as the king eats.  Then she\nsummoned her confectioner, who had to bake confectionery such as the\nking ate, and carry it to the door for the bear.  Then the bear first\nlicked up the comfits which had rolled down, and then he stood\nupright, took the dish, and carried it to his master.  Behold, sir\nhost, said the huntsman, now I have bread, meat, vegetables and\nconfectionery, but I will drink wine also, and such as the king\ndrinks.  He called his lion to him and said, dear lion, you yourself\nlike to drink till you are tipsy, go and fetch me some wine, such as\nis drunk by the king.\n\nThen the lion strode through the streets, and the people fled from\nhim, and when he came to the watch, they wanted to bar the way\nagainst him, but he did but roar once, and they all ran away.  Then\nthe lion went to the royal apartment, and knocked at the door with\nhis tail.  The the king's daughter came forth, and was almost afraid\nof the lion, but she knew him by the golden clasp of her necklace,\nand bade him go with her into her chamber, and said, dear lion, what\nwill you have.  He answered, my master, who killed the dragon, is\nhere, and I am to ask for some wine such as is drunk by the king.\nThen she bade the cup-bearer be called, who was to give the lion some\nwine like that which was drunk by the king.  The lion said, I will go\nwith him, and see that I get the right wine.  Then he went down with\nthe cup-bearer, and when they were below, the cup-bearer wanted to\ndraw him some of the common wine that was drunk by the king's\nservants, but the lion said, stop, I will taste the wine first, and\nhe drew half a measure, and swallowed it down at one draught.  No,\nsaid he, that is not right.  The cup-bearer looked at him askance,\nbut went on, and was about to give him some out of another barrel\nwhich was for the king's marshal.  The lion said, stop, let me taste\nthe wine first, and drew half a measure and drank it.  That is\nbetter, but still not right, said he.  Then the cup-bearer grew angry\nand said, how can a stupid animal like you understand wine.  But the\nlion gave him a blow behind the ears, which made him fall down by no\nmeans gently, and when he had got up again, he conducted the lion\nquite silently into a little cellar apart, where the king's wine lay,\nfrom which no one ever drank.  The lion first drew half a measure and\ntried the wine, and then he said, that may possibly be the right\nsort, and bade the cup-bearer fill six bottles of it.  And now they\nwent upstairs again, but when the lion came out of the cellar into\nthe open air, he reeled here and there, and was rather drunk, and the\ncup-bearer was forced to carry the wine as far as the door for him,\nand then the lion took the handle of the basket in his mouth, and\ntook it to his master.  The huntsman said, behold, sir host, here\nhave I bread, meat, vegetables, confectionery and wine such as the\nking has, and now I will dine with my animals, and he sat down and\nate and drank, and gave the hare, the fox, the wolf, the bear, and\nthe lion also to eat and to drink, and was joyful, for he saw that\nthe king's daughter still loved him.  And when he had finished his\ndinner, he said, sir host, now have I eaten and drunk, as the king\neats and drinks, and now I will go to the king's court and marry the\nking's daughter.\n\nSaid the host, how can that be, when she already has a betrothed\nhusband, and when the wedding is to be solemnized to-day.  Then the\nhuntsman drew forth the handerchief which the king's daughter had\ngiven him on the dragon's hill, and in which were folded the\nmonster's seven tongues, and said, that which I hold in my hand shall\nhelp me to do it.  Then the innkeeper looked at the handkerchief, and\nsaid, whatever I believe, I do not believe that, and I am willing to\nstake my house and courtyard on it.  The huntsman, however, took a\nbag with a thousand gold pieces, put it on the table, and said, I\nstake that on it.\n\nNow the king said to his daughter, at the royal table, what did all\nthe wild animals want, which have been coming to you, and going in\nand out of my palace.  She replied, I may not tell you, but send and\nhave the master of these animals brought, and you will do well.  The\nking sent a servant to the inn, and invited the stranger, and the\nservant came just as the huntsman had laid his wager with the\ninnkeeper.  Then said he, behold, sir host, now the king sends his\nservant and invites me, but I do not go in this way.\n\nAnd he said to the servant, I request the lord king to send me royal\nclothing, and a carriage with six horses, and servants to attend me.\nWhen the king heard the answer, he said to his daughter, what shall I\ndo.  She said, cause him to be fetched as he desires to be, and you\nwill do well.  Then the king sent royal apparel, a carriage with six\nhorses, and servants to wait on him.  When the huntsman saw them\ncoming, he said, behold, sir host, now I am fetched as I desired to\nbe, and he put on the royal garments, took the handerchief with the\ndragon's tongues with him, and drove off to the king.  When the king\nsaw him coming, he said to his daughter, how shall I receive him.\nShe answered, go to meet him and you will do well.  Then the king\nwent to meet him and led him in, and his animals followed.  The king\ngave him a seat near himself and his daughter, and the marshal, as\nbridegroom, sat on the other side, but no longer knew the huntsman.\nAnd now at this very moment, the seven heads of the dragon were\nbrought in as a spectacle, and the king said, the seven heads were\ncut off the dragon by the marshal, wherefore to-day I give him my\ndaughter to wife.  The the huntsman stood up, opened the seven\nmouths, and said, where are the seven tongues of the dragon.  Then\nwas the marshal terrified, and grew pale and knew not what answer he\nshould make, and at length in his anguish he said, dragons have no\ntongues.  The huntsman said, liars ought to have none, but the\ndragon's tongues are the tokens of the victor, and he unfolded the\nhanderchief, and there lay all seven inside it.  And he put each\ntongue in the mouth to which it belonged, and it fitted exactly.\n\nThen he took the handkerchief on which the name of the princess was\nembroidered, and showed it to the maiden, and asked to whom she had\ngiven it, and she replied, to him who killed the dragon. And then he\ncalled his animals, and took the collar off each of them and the\ngolden clasp from the lion, and showed them to the maiden and asked\nto whom they belonged.  She answered, the necklace and golden clasp\nwere mine, but I divided them among the animals who helped to conquer\nthe dragon.  Then spoke the huntsman, when I, tired of the fight, was\nresting and sleeping, the marshal came and cut off my head.  Then he\ncarried away the king's daughter, and gave out that it was he who had\nkilled the dragon, but that he lied I prove with the tongues, the\nhandkerchief, and the necklace.\n\nAnd then he related how his animals had healed him by means of a\nwonderful root, and how he had traveled about with them for one year,\nand had at length come there and had learnt the treachery of the\nmarshal by the inn-keeper's story.  Then the king asked his daughter,\nis it true that this man killed the dragon.\n\nAnd she answered, yes, it is true.  Now can I reveal the wicked deed\nof the marshal, as it has come to light without my connivance, for he\nwrung from me a promise to be silent.  For this reason, however, did\nI make the condition that the marriage should not be solemnized for a\nyear and a day.  Then the king bade twelve councillors be summoned\nwho were to pronounce judgment on the marshal, and they sentenced him\nto be torn to pieces by four bulls.\n\nThe marshal was therefore executed, but the king gave his daughter to\nthe huntsman, and named him his viceroy over the whole kingdom.  The\nwedding was celebrated with great joy, and the young king caused his\nfather and his foster-father to be brought, and loaded them with\ntreasures.  Neither did he forget the inn-keeper, but sent for him\nand said, behold, sir host, I have married the king's daughter, and\nyour house and yard are mine.\n\nThe host said, yes, according to justice it is so.  But the young\nking said, it shall be done according to mercy, and told him that he\nshould keep his house and yard, and gave him the thousand pieces of\ngold as well.\n\nAnd now the young king and queen were thoroughly happy, and lived in\ngladness together.  He often went out hunting because it was a\ndelight to him, and the faithful animals had to accompany him.  In\nthe neighborhood, however, there was a forest of which it was\nreported that it was haunted, and that whosoever did but enter it did\nnot easily get out again.  But the young king had a great inclination\nto hunt in it, and let the old king have no peace until he allowed\nhim to do so.  So he rode forth with a great following, and when he\ncame to the forest, he saw a snow-white hind, and said to his men,\nwait here until I return, I want to hunt that beautiful creature, and\nhe rode into the forest after it, followed only by his animals.  The\nattendants halted and waited until evening, but he did not return, so\nthey rode home, and told the young queen that the young king had\nfollowed a white hind into the enchanted forest, and had not come\nback again.  Then she was in the greatest concern about him.  He,\nhowever, had still continued to ride on and on after the beautiful\nwild animal, and had never been able to overtake it, when he thought\nhe was near enough to aim, he instantly saw it bound away into the\nfar distance, and at length it vanished altogether.  And now he\nperceived that he had penetrated deep into the forest, and blew his\nhorn but he received no answer, for his attendants could not hear it.\nAnd as night was falling, he saw that he could not get home that day,\nso he dismounted from his horse, lighted himself a fire near a tree,\nand resolved to spend the night by it.  While he was sitting by the\nfire, and his animals also were lying down beside him, it seemed to\nhim that he heard a human voice.  He looked round, but could\nperceived nothing.  Soon afterwards, he again heard a groan as if\nfrom above, and then he looked up, and saw an old woman sitting in\nthe tree, who wailed unceasingly, oh, oh, oh, how cold I am.  Said\nhe, come down, and warm yourself if you are cold.  But she said, no,\nyour animals will bite me.  He answered, they will do you no harm,\nold mother, do come down.  She, however, was a witch, and said, I\nwill throw down a wand from the tree, and if you strike them on the\nback with it, they will do me no harm.  Then she threw him a small\nwand, and he struck them with it, and instantly they lay still and\nwere turned into stone.  And when the witch was safe from the\nanimals, she leapt down and touched him also with a wand, and changed\nhim to stone.  Thereupon she laughed, and dragged him and the animals\ninto a vault, where many more such stones already lay.\n\nAs the young king did not come back at all, the queen's anguish and\ncare grew constantly greater.  And it so happened that at this very\ntime the other brother who had turned to the east when they\nseparated, came into the kingdom.  He had sought a situation, and had\nfound none, and had then traveled about here and there, and had made\nhis animals dance.  Then it came into his mind that he would just go\nand look at the knife that they had thrust in the trunk of a tree at\ntheir parting, that he might learn how his brother was.  When he got\nthere his brother's side of the knife was half rusted, and half\nbright.  Then he was alarmed and thought, a great misfortune must\nhave befallen my brother, but perhaps I can still save him, for half\nthe knife is still bright.  He and his animals traveled towards the\nwest, and when he entered the gate of the town, the guard came to\nmeet him, and asked if he was to announce him to his consort the\nyoung queen, who had for a couple of days been in the greatest sorrow\nabout his staying away, and was afraid he had been killed in the\nenchanted forest.\n\nThe sentries, indeed, thought no otherwise than that he was the young\nking himself, for he looked so like him, and had wild animals running\nbehind him.  Then he saw that they were speaking of his brother, and\nthought, it will be better if I pass myself off for him, and then I\ncan rescue him more easily.  So he allowed himself to be escorted\ninto the castle by the guard, and was received with the greatest joy.\nThe young queen indeed thought that he was her husband, and asked him\nwhy he had stayed away so long.  He answered, I had lost myself in a\nforest, and could not find my way out again any sooner.  At night he\nwas taken to the royal bed, but he laid a two-edged sword between him\nand the young queen, she did not know what that could mean, but did\nnot venture to ask.\n\nHe remained in the palace a couple of days, and in the meantime\ninquired into everything which related to the enchanted forest, and\nat last he said, I must hunt there once more.  The king and the young\nqueen wanted to persuade him not to do it, but he stood out against\nthem, and went forth with a larger following.  When he had got into\nthe forest, it fared with him as with his brother, he saw a white\nhind and said to his men, stay here, and wait until I return, I want\nto chase the lovely wild beast, and then he rode into the forest and\nhis animals ran after him.  But he could not overtake the hind, and\ngot so deep into the forest that he was forced to pass the night\nthere.  And when he had lighted a fire, he heard someone wailing\nabove him, oh, oh, oh, how cold I am.\n\nThen he looked up, and the self-same witch was sitting in the tree.\nSaid he, if you are cold, come down, little old mother, and warm\nyourself.  She answered, no, your animals will bite me. But he said,\nthey will not hurt you.  Then she cried, I will throw down a wand to\nyou, and if you smite them with it they will do me no harm.  When the\nhuntsman heard that, he had no confidence in the old woman, and said,\nI will not strike my animals.  Come down, or I will fetch you.  Then\nshe cried, what do you want.  You shall not touch me.  But he\nreplied, if you do not come, I will shoot you.  Said she, shoot away,\nI do not fear your bullets.\n\nThen he aimed, and fired at her, but the witch was proof against all\nleaden bullets, and laughed shrilly and cried, you shall not hit me.\nThe huntsman knew what to do, tore three silver buttons off his coat,\nand loaded his gun with them, for against them her arts were useless,\nand when he fired she fell down at once with a scream.  Then he set\nhis foot on her and said, old witch, if you do not instantly confess\nwhere my brother is, I will seize you with both my hands and throw\nyou into the fire.  She was in a great fright, begged for mercy and\nsaid, he and his animals lie in a vault, turned to stone.  Then he\ncompelled her to go thither with him, threatened her, and said, old\nsea-cat, now you shall make my brother and all the human beings lying\nhere, alive again, or you shall go into the fire.  She took a wand\nand touched the stones, and then his brother with his animals came to\nlife again, and many others, merchants, artisans, and shepherds,\narose, thanked him for their deliverance, and went to their homes.\nBut when the twin brothers saw each other again, they kissed each\nother and rejoiced with all their hearts.  Then they seized the\nwitch, bound her and laid her on the fire, and when she was burnt the\nforest opened of its own accord, and was light and clear, and the\nking's palace could be seen at about the distance of a three hours,\nwalk.\n\nThereupon the two brothers went home together, and on the way told\neach other their histories.  And when the younger said that he was\nruler of the whole country in the king's stead, the other observed,\nthat I remarked very well, for when I came to the town, and was taken\nfor you, all royal honors were paid me, the young queen looked on me\nas her husband, and I had to eat at her side, and sleep in your bed.\nWhen the other heard that, he became so jealous and angry that he\ndrew his sword, and struck off his brother's head.  But when he saw\nhim lying there dead, and saw his red blood flowing, he repented most\nviolently, my brother delivered me, cried he, and I have killed him\nfor it, and he bewailed him aloud.  Then his hare came and offered to\ngo and bring some of the root of life, and bounded away and brought\nit while yet there was time, and the dead man was brought to life\nagain, and knew nothing about the wound.\n\nAfter this they journeyed onwards, and the younger said, you look\nlike me, you have royal apparel on as I have, and the animals follow\nyou as they do me, we will go in by opposite gates, and arrive at the\nsame time from the two sides in the aged king's presence.  So they\nseparated, and at the same time came the watchmen from the one door\nand from the other, and announced that the young king and the animals\nhad returned from the chase.\n\nThe king said, it is not possible, the gates lie quite a mile apart.\nIn the meantime, however, the two brothers entered the courtyard of\nthe palace from opposite sides, and both mounted the steps. Then the\nking said to the daughter, say which is your husband.\n\nEach of them looks exactly like the other, I cannot tell.  Then she\nwas in great distress, and could not tell, but at last she remembered\nthe necklace which she had given to the animals, and she sought for\nand found her little golden clasp on the lion, and she cried in her\ndelight, he who is followed by this lion is my true husband.  Then\nthe young king laughed and said, yes, he is the right one, and they\nsat down together to table, and ate and drank, and were merry.  At\nnight when the young king went to bed, his wife said, why have you\nfor these last nights always laid a two-edged sword in our bed.  I\nthought you had a wish to kill me.  Then he knew how true his brother\nhad been.\n\n", "The Three Feathers": "There was once upon a time a king who had three sons, of whom two\nwere clever and wise, but the third did not speak much, and was\nsimple, and was called the simpleton.  When the king had become old\nand weak, and was thinking of his end, he did not know which of his\nsons should inherit the kingdom after him.  Then he said to them, go\nforth, and he who brings me the most beautiful carpet shall be king\nafter my death.\n\nAnd that there should be no dispute amongst them, he took them\noutside his castle, blew three feathers in the air, and said, you\nshall go as they fly.  One feather flew to the east, the other to the\nwest, but the third flew straight up and did not fly far, but soon\nfell to the ground.\n\nAnd now one brother went to the right, and the other to the left, and\nthey mocked simpleton, who was forced to stay where the third feather\nhad fallen.  He sat down and was sad.  Then all at once he saw that\nthere was a trap-door close by the feather.  He raised it up, found\nsome steps, and went down them.  Then he came to another door,\nknocked at it, and heard somebody inside calling -\n          little green waiting-maid,\n          waiting-maid with the limping leg,\n          little dog of the limping leg,\n          hop hither and thither,\n          and quickly see who is without.\n\nThe door opened, and he saw a great, fat toad sitting, and round\nabout her a crowd of little toads.  The fat toad asked what he\nwanted.  He answered, I should like to have the prettiest and finest\ncarpet in the world.  Then she called a young one and said -\n          little green waiting-maid,\n          waiting-maid with the limping leg,\n          little dog of the limping leg,\n          hop hither and thither,\n          and bring me the great box.\n\nThe young toad brought the box, and the fat toad opened it, and gave\nsimpleton a carpet out of it, so beautiful and so fine, that on the\nearth above, none could have been woven like it.  Then he thanked\nher, and climbed out again.\n\nThe two others, however, had looked on their youngest brother as so\nstupid that they believed he would find and bring nothing at all.\nWhy should we give ourselves a great deal of trouble searching, said\nthey, and got some coarse handkerchiefs from the first shepherds'\nwives whom they met, and carried them home to the king.\n\nAt the same time simpleton also came back, and brought his beautiful\ncarpet, and when the king saw it he was astonished, and said, if\njustice be done, the kingdom belongs to the youngest.  But the two\nothers let their father have no peace, and said that it was\nimpossible that simpleton, who in everything lacked understanding,\nshould be king, and entreated him to make a new agreement with them.\nThen the father said, he who brings me the most beautiful ring shall\ninherit the kingdom, and led the three brothers out, and blew into\nthe air three feathers, which they were to follow.  Those of the two\neldest again went east and west, and simpleton's feather flew\nstraight up, and fell down near the door into the earth.\n\nThen he went down again to the fat toad, and told her that he wanted\nthe most beautiful ring.  She at once ordered her big box to be\nbrought, and gave him a ring out of it, which sparkled with jewels,\nand was so beautiful that no goldsmith on earth would have been able\nto make it.\n\nThe two eldest laughed at simpleton for going to seek a golden ring.\nThey gave themselves no trouble, but knocked the nails out of an old\ncarriage-ring, and took it to the king, but when simpleton produced\nhis golden ring, his father again said, the kingdom belongs to him.\nThe two eldest did not cease from tormenting the king until he made a\nthird condition, and declared that the one who brought the most\nbeautiful woman home, should have the kingdom.  He again blew the\nthree feathers into the air, and they flew as before.\n\nThen simpleton without more ado went down to the fat toad, and said,\nI am to take home the most beautiful woman.  Oh, answered the toad,\nthe most beautiful woman.  She is not at hand at the moment, but\nstill you shall have her.  She gave him a yellow turnip which had\nbeen hollowed out, to which six mice were harnessed.  Then simpleton\nsaid quite mournfully, what am I to do with that.  The toad answered,\njust put one of my little toads into it.  Then he seized one at\nrandom out of the circle, and put her into the yellow coach, but\nhardly was she seated inside it than she turned into a wonderfully\nbeautiful maiden, and the turnip into a coach, and the six mice into\nhorses.  So he kissed her, and drove off quickly with the horses, and\ntook her to the king.\n\nHis brothers, who came afterwards, had given themselves no trouble at\nall looking for beautiful girls, but had brought with them the first\npeasant women they chanced to meet.  When the king saw them he said,\nafter my death the kingdom belongs to my youngest son.  But the two\neldest deafened the king's ears afresh with their clamor, we cannot\nconsent to simpleton's being king, and demanded that the one whose\nwife could leap through a ring which hung in the centre of the hall\nshould have the preference.  They thought, the peasant women can do\nthat easily, they are strong enough, but the delicate maiden will\njump herself to death.\n\nThe aged king agreed likewise to this.  Then the two peasant women\njumped, and jumped through the ring, but were so clumsy that they\nfell, and their coarse arms and legs broke in two.  And then the\npretty maiden whom simpleton had brought with him, sprang, and sprang\nthrough as lightly as a deer, and all opposition had to cease. So he\nreceived the crown, and has ruled wisely for a length of time.\n", "Allerleirauh": "\tAllerleirauh\n\nThere was once upon a time a king who had a wife with golden hair,\nand she was so beautiful that her equal was not to be found on earth.\nIt came to pass that she lay ill, and as she felt that she must soon\ndie, she called the king and said, if you wish to marry again after\nmy death, take no one who is not quite as beautiful as I am, and who\nhas not just such golden hair as I have, this you must promise me.\nAnd after the king had promised her this she closed her eyes and\ndied.\n\nFor a long time the king could not be comforted, and had no thought\nof taking another wife.  At length his councillors said, this cannot\ngo on.  The king must marry again, that we may have a queen.  And now\nmessengers were sent about far and wide, to seek a bride who equalled\nthe late queen in beauty.  In the whole world, however, none was to\nbe found, and even if one had been found, still there would have been\nno one who had such golden hair.  So the messengers came home as they\nwent.\n\nNow the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her dead\nmother, and had the same golden hair.  When she was grown up the king\nlooked at her one day, and saw that in every respect she was like his\nlate wife, and suddenly felt a violent love for her.  Then he spoke\nto his councillors, I will marry my daughter, for she is the\ncounterpart of my late wife, otherwise I can find no bride who\nresembles her.  When the councillors heard that, they were shocked,\nand said, God has forbidden a father to marry his daughter.  No good\ncan come from such a crime, and the kingdom will be involved in the\nruin.\n\nThe daughter was still more shocked when she became aware of her\nfather's resolution, but hoped to turn him from his design. Then she\nsaid to him, before I fulfil your wish, I must have three dresses,\none as golden as the sun, one as silvery as the moon, and one as\nbright as the stars, besides this, I wish for a mantle of a thousand\ndifferent kinds of fur and peltry joined together, and one of every\nkind of animal in your kingdom must give a piece of his skin for it.\nFor she thought, to get that will be quite impossible, and thus I\nshall divert my father from his wicked intentions.  The king,\nhowever, did not give it up, and the cleverest maidens in his kingdom\nhad to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as\nsilvery as the moon, and one as bright as the stars, and his huntsmen\nhad to catch one of every kind of animal in the whole of his kingdom,\nand take from it a piece of its skin, and out of these was made a\nmantle of a thousand different kinds of fur.  At length, when all was\nready, the king caused the mantle to be brought, spread it out before\nher, and said, the wedding shall be tomorrow.\n\nWhen, therefore, the king's daughter saw that there was no longer any\nhope of turning her father's heart, she resolved to run away.  In the\nnight whilst every one was asleep, she got up, and took three\ndifferent things from her treasures, a golden ring, a golden\nspinning-wheel, and a golden reel.  The three dresses of the sun,\nmoon, and stars she placed into a nutshell, put on her mantle of all\nkinds of fur, and blackened her face and hands with soot.  Then she\ncommended herself to God, and went away, and walked the whole night\nuntil she reached a great forest.  And as she was tired, she got into\na hollow tree, and fell asleep.\n\nThe sun rose, and she slept on, and she was still sleeping when it\nwas full day.  Then it so happened that the king to whom this forest\nbelonged, was hunting in it.  When his dogs came to the tree, they\nsniffed, and ran barking round about it.  The king said to the\nhuntsmen, just see what kind of wild beast has hidden itself in\nthere.  The huntsmen obeyed his order, and when they came back they\nsaid, a wondrous beast is lying in the hollow tree, we have never\nbefore seen one like it.  Its skin is fur of a thousand different\nkinds, but it is lying asleep.  Said the king, see if you can catch\nit alive, and then fasten it to the carriage, and we will take it\nwith us.  When the huntsmen laid hold of the maiden, she awoke full\nof terror, and cried to them, I am a poor child, deserted by father\nand mother, have pity on me, and take me with you.  Then said they,\nAllerleirauh, you will be useful in the kitchen, come with us, and\nyou can sweep up the ashes.  So they put her in the carriage, and\ntook her home to the royal palace.  There they pointed out to her a\ncloset under the stairs, where no daylight entered, and said, hairy\nanimal, there you can live and sleep.  Then she was sent into the\nkitchen, and there she carried wood and water, swept the hearth,\nplucked the fowls, picked the vegetables, raked the ashes, and did\nall the dirty work.\n\nAllerleirauh lived there for a long time in great wretchedness. Alas,\nfair princess, what is to become of you now.  It happened, however,\nthat one day a feast was held in the palace, and she said to the\ncook, may I go upstairs for a while, and look on.  I will place\nmyself outside the door.  The cook answered, yes, go, but you must be\nback here in half-an-hour to sweep the hearth.\n\nThen she took her oil-lamp, went into her den, put off her dress of\nfur, and washed the soot off her face and hands, so that her full\nbeauty once more came to light.  And she opened the nut, and took out\nher dress which shone like the sun, and when she had done that she\nwent up to the festival, and every one made way for her, for no one\nknew her, and thought no otherwise than that she was a king's\ndaughter.  The king came to meet her, gave his hand to her, and\ndanced with her, and thought in his heart, my eyes have never yet\nseen any one so beautiful.  When the dance was over she curtsied, and\nwhen the king looked round again she had vanished, and none knew\nwhither.  The guards who stood outside the palace were called and\nquestioned, but no one had seen her.\n\nShe had run into her little den, however, there quickly taken off her\ndress, made her face and hands black again, put on the mantle of fur,\nand again was Allerleirauh.  And now when she went into the kitchen,\nand was about to get to her work and sweep up the ashes, the cook\nsaid, leave that alone till morning, and make me the soup for the\nking, I, too, will go upstairs awhile, and take a look, but let no\nhairs fall in, or in future you shall have nothing to eat.  So the\ncook went away, and Allerleirauh made the soup for the king, and made\nbread soup and the best she could, and when it was ready she fetched\nher golden ring from her little den, and put it in the bowl in which\nthe soup was served.  When the dancing was over, the king had his\nsoup brought and ate it, and he liked it so much that it seemed to\nhim he had never tasted better.  But when he came to the bottom of\nthe bowl, he saw a golden ring lying, and could not conceive how it\ncould have got there.  Then he ordered the cook to appear before him.\nThe cook was terrified when he heard the order, and said to\nAllerleirauh, you have certainly let a hair fall into the soup, and\nif you have, you shall be beaten for it.\n\nWhen he came before the king the latter asked who had made the soup.\nThe cook replied, I made it.  But the king said, that is not true,\nfor it was much better than usual, and cooked differently.  He\nanswered, I must acknowledge that I did not make it, it was made by\nthe hairy animal.  The king said, go and bid it come up here.\n\nWhen Allerleirauh came, the king said, who are you.  I am a poor girl\nwho no longer has any father or mother.  He asked further, of what\nuse are you in my palace.  She answered, I am good for nothing but to\nhave boots thrown at my head.  He continued, where did you get the\nring which was in the soup.  She answered, I know nothing about the\nring.  So the king could learn nothing, and had to send her away\nagain.\n\nAfter a while, there was another festival, and then, as before,\nAllerleirauh begged the cook for leave to go and look on.  He\nanswered, yes, but come back again in half-an-hour, and make the king\nthe bread soup which he so much likes.  Then she ran into her den,\nwashed herself quickly, and took out of the nut the dress which was\nas silvery as the moon, and put it on.  Then she went up and was like\na princess, and the king stepped forward to meet her, and rejoiced to\nsee her once more, and as the dance was just beginning they danced it\ntogether.  But when it was ended, she again disappeared so quickly\nthat the king could not observe where she went.  She, however, sprang\ninto her den, and once more made herself a hairy animal, and went\ninto the kitchen to prepare the bread soup.  When the cook had gone\nupstairs, she fetched the little golden spinning-wheel, and put it in\nthe bowl so that the soup covered it.  Then it was taken to the king,\nwho ate it, and liked it as much as before, and had the cook brought,\nwho this time likewise was forced to confess that Allerleirauh had\nprepared the soup.  Allerleirauh again came before the king, but she\nanswered that she was good for nothing else but to have boots thrown\nat her head, and that she knew nothing at all about the little golden\nspinning-wheel.\n\nWhen, for the third time, the king held a festival, all happened just\nas it had done before.  The cook said, fur-skin, you are a witch, and\nalways put something in the soup which makes it so good that the king\nlikes it better than that which I cook, but as she begged so hard, he\nlet her go up at the appointed time.  And now she put on the dress\nwhich shone like the stars, and thus entered the hall.  Again the\nking danced with the beautiful maiden, and thought that she never yet\nhad been so beautiful.\n\nAnd whilst she was dancing, he contrived, without her noticing it, to\nslip a golden ring on her finger, and he had given orders that the\ndance should last a very long time.  When it was ended, he wanted to\nhold her fast by her hands, but she tore herself loose, and sprang\naway so quickly through the crowd that she vanished from his sight.\nShe ran as fast as she could into her den beneath the stairs, but as\nshe had been too long, and had stayed more than half-an-hour she\ncould not take off her pretty dress, but only threw over it her\nmantle of fur, and in her haste she did not make herself quite black,\nbut one finger remained white.  Then Allerleirauh ran into the\nkitchen, and cooked the bread soup for the king, and as the cook was\naway, put her golden reel into it.\n\nWhen the king found the reel at the bottom of it, he caused\nAllerleirauh to be summoned, and then he espied the white finger, and\nsaw the ring which he had put on it during the dance.  Then he\ngrasped her by the hand, and held her fast, and when she wanted to\nrelease herself and run away, her mantle of fur opened a little, and\nthe star-dress shone forth.  The king clutched the mantle and tore it\noff.  Then her golden hair shone forth, and she stood there in full\nsplendor, and could no longer hide herself.  And when she had washed\nthe soot and ashes from her face, she was more beautiful than anyone\nwho had ever been seen on earth.  But the king said, you are my dear\nbride, and we will never more part from each other. Thereupon the\nmarriage was solemnized, and they lived happily until their death.\n", "The Hare's Bride": "There was once a woman and her daughter who lived in a\npretty garden with cabbages.  And a little hare came into it,\nand during the winter time ate all the cabbages.  Then says the\nmother to the daughter, go into the garden, and chase the hare away.\n\nThe girl says to the little hare, sh-sh, hare, you will be eating\nall our cabbages.  Says the hare, come, maiden, and seat yourself\non my little hare's tail, and come with me into my\nlittle hare's hut.  The girl will not do it.\n\nNext day the hare\ncomes again and eats the cabbages, then says the mother to the\ndaughter, go into the garden, and drive the hare away.  The girl\nsays to the hare, sh-sh, little hare, you will be eating all the\ncabbages.  The little hare says, maiden, seat yourself on my\nlittle hare's tail, and come with me into my little hare's hut.\nThe maiden refuses.\n\nThe third day the hare comes again, and eats\nthe cabbages.  On this the mother says to the daughter, go into\nthe garden, and hunt the hare away.  Says the maiden, sh-sh, little\nhare, you will be eating all our cabbages.  Says the little\nhare, come, maiden, seat yourself on my little hare's tail,\nand come with me into my little hare's hut.\n\nThe girl seats\nherself on the little hare's tail, and then the hare takes her\nfar away to his little hut, and says, now cook green cabbage and\nmillet-seed, and I will invite the wedding-guests.  Then all\nthe wedding-guests assembled.  Who were the wedding-guests?\nThat I can tell you as another told it to me.  They were all\nhares, and the crow was there as parson to marry the bride\nand bridegroom, and the fox as clerk, and the altar was under\nthe rainbow.\n\nThe girl, however, was sad, for she was all alone.  The little hare\ncomes and says, open the doors, open the doors, the wedding-guests\nare merry.  The bride says nothing, but weeps.  The little\nhare goes away.  The little hare comes back and says, take off\nthe lid, take off the lid, the wedding-guests are hungry.  The\nbride again says nothing, and weeps.  The little hare goes away.\nThe little hare comes back and says, take off the lid, take off\nthe lid, the wedding-guests are waiting.  Then the bride says\nnothing, and the hare goes away, but she dresses a straw-doll\nin her clothes, and gives her a spoon to stir with, and sets\nher by the pan with the millet-seed, and goes back to her\nmother.  The little hare comes once more and says, take off\nthe lid, take off the lid, and gets up, and strikes the doll\non the head so that her cap falls off.\nThen the little hare sees that it is not his bride, and goes\naway and is sorrowful.\n", "The Thief and His Master": "Hans wished to put his son to learn a trade, so he went into the\nchurch and prayed to our Lord God to know which would be the most\nsuitable for him.  Then the clerk got behind the altar, and said,\nthieving, thieving.  On this Hans goes back to his son, and tells him\nhe is to learn thieving, and that the Lord God had said so.  So he\ngoes with his son to seek a man who is acquainted with thieving.\nThey walk a long time and come into a great forest, where stands a\nlittle house with an old woman in it.  Hans says, do you know of a\nman who is acquainted with thieving.  You can learn that here quite\nwell, says the woman, my son is a master of it.  So he speaks with\nthe son, and asks if he knows thieving really well.  The master-thief\nsays, I will teach him well.  Come back when a year is over, and then\nif you recognize your son, I will take no payment at all for teaching\nhim, but if you don't know him, you must give me two hundred talers.\n\nThe father goes home again, and the son learns witchcraft and\nthieving, thoroughly.  When the year is out, the father is full of\nanxiety to know how he shall recognize his son.  As he is thus going\nabout in his trouble, he meets a little dwarf, who says, man, what\nails you, that you are always in such trouble.\n\nOh, says Hans, a year ago I placed my son with a master-thief who\ntold me I was to come back when the year was out, and that if I then\ndid not know my son when I saw him, I was to pay two hundred talers,\nbut if I did know him I was to pay nothing, and now I am afraid of\nnot knowing him and can't tell where I am to get the money.  Then the\ndwarf tells him to take a crust of bread with him, and to stand\nbeneath the chimney.  There on the cross-beam is a basket, out of\nwhich a little bird is peeping, and that is your son.\n\nHans goes thither, and throws a crust of black bread in front of the\nbasket with the bird in it, and the little bird comes out, and looks\nup.  Hello, my son, are you here, says the father, and the son is\ndelighted to see his father, but the master-thief says, the devil\nmust have prompted you, or how could you have known your son.\nFather, let us go, said the youth.\n\nThen the father and son set out homeward.  On the way a carriage\ncomes driving by.  Hereupon the son says to his father, I will change\nmyself into a large greyhound, and then you can earn a great deal of\nmoney by me.  Then the gentleman calls from the carriage, my man,\nwill you sell your dog.  Yes, says the father. How much do you want\nfor it.  Thirty talers.  Well, man, that is a great deal, but as it\nis such a very fine dog I will have it. The gentleman takes it into\nhis carriage, but when they have driven a little farther the dog\nsprings out of the carriage through the window, and goes back to his\nfather, and is no longer a greyhound.\n\nThey go home together.  Next day there is a fair in the neighboring\ntown, so the youth says to his father, I will now change myself into\na beautiful horse, and you can sell me, but when you have sold me,\nyou must take off my bridle, or I cannot become a man again.  Then\nthe father goes with the horse to the fair, and the master-thief\ncomes and buys the horse for a hundred talers, but the father\nforgets, and does not take off the bridle.  So the man goes home with\nthe horse, and puts it in the stable.\n\nWhen the maid crosses the threshold, the horse says, take off my\nbridle, take off my bridle. Then the maid stands still, and says,\nwhat, can you speak.  So she goes and takes the bridle off, and the\nhorse becomes a sparrow, and flies out at the door, and the\nmaster-thief becomes a sparrow also, and flies after him.\n\nThen they come together and cast lots again, and the master loses.\nSo the master changes himself into a cock, and the youth becomes a\nfox, and bites the master's head off, and he died and has remained\ndead to this day.\n", "The Three Sons of Fortune": "A father once called his three sons before him, and he gave to the\nfirst a cock, to the second a scythe, and to the third a cat.  I am\nalready aged, said he, my death is nigh, and I have wished to provide\nfor you before my end, money I have not, and what I now give you\nseems of little worth, but all depends on your making a sensible use\nof it.  Only seek out a country where such things are still unknown,\nand your fortune is made.\n\nAfter the father's death the eldest went away with his cock, but\nwherever he came the cock was already known, in the towns he saw him\nfrom a long distance, sitting upon the steeples and turning round\nwith the wind, and in the villages he heard more than one crowing, no\none would show any wonder at the creature, so that it did not look as\nif he would make his fortune by it.\n\nAt last, however, it happened that he came to an island where the\npeople knew nothing about cocks, and did not even understand how to\ndivide their time.  They certainly knew when it was morning or\nevening, but at night, if they did not sleep through it, not one of\nthem knew how to find out the time.\n\nLook. Said he, what a proud creature.  It has a ruby-red crown upon\nits head, and wears spurs like a knight, it calls you three times\nduring the night, at fixed hours, and when it calls for the last\ntime, the sun soon rises.  But if it crows by broad daylight, then\ntake notice, for there will certainly be a change of weather.\n\nThe people were well pleased, for a whole night they did not sleep,\nand listened with great delight as the cock at two, four, and six\no'clock, loudly and clearly proclaimed the time.  They asked if the\ncreature were for sale, and how much he wanted for it.  About as much\ngold as an ass can carry, answered he.  A ridiculously small price\nfor such a precious creature. They cried unanimously, and willingly\ngave him what he had asked.\n\nWhen he came home with his wealth his brothers were astonished, and\nthe second said, well, I will go forth and see whether I cannot get\nrid of my scythe as profitably.  But it did not look as if he would,\nfor laborers met him everywhere, and they had scythes upon their\nshoulders as well as he.\n\nAt last, however, he chanced upon an island where the people knew\nnothing of scythes.  When the corn was ripe there, they took cannon\nout to the fields and shot it down.  Now this was rather an uncertain\naffair, many shot right over it, others hit the ears instead of the\nstems, and shot them away, whereby much was lost, and besides all\nthis, it made a terrible noise.  So the man set to work and mowed it\ndown so quietly and quickly that the people opened their mouths with\nastonishment.  They agreed to give him what he wanted for the scythe,\nand he received a horse laden with as much gold as it could carry.\n\nAnd now the third brother wanted to take his cat to the right man. He\nfared just like the others, so long as he stayed on the mainland\nthere was nothing to be done.  Every place had cats, and there were\nso many of them that new-born kittens were generally drowned in the\nponds.\n\nAt last he sailed over to an island, and it luckily happened that no\ncats had ever yet been seen there, and that the mice had got the\nupper hand so much that they danced upon the tables and benches\nwhether the master were at home or not.  The people complained\nbitterly of the plague, the king himself in his palace did not know\nhow to protect himself against them, mice squeaked in every corner,\nand gnawed whatever they could lay hold of with their teeth.\n\nBut now the cat began her chase, and soon cleared a couple of rooms,\nand the people begged the king to buy the wonderful beast for the\ncountry.  The king willingly gave what was asked, which was a mule\nladen with gold, and the third brother came home with the greatest\ntreasure of all.\n\nThe cat made herself merry with the mice in the royal palace, and\nkilled so many that they could not be counted.  At last she grew warm\nwith the work and thirsty, so she stood still, lifted up her head and\ncried, mew. Mew.\n\nWhen they heard this strange cry, the king and all his people were\nfrightened, and in their terror ran all at once out of the palace.\nThen the king took counsel what was best to be done, at last it was\ndetermined to send a herald to the cat, and demand that she should\nleave the palace, or if not, she was to expect that force would be\nused against her.  The councillors said, rather will we let ourselves\nbe plagued with the mice, for to that misfortune we are accustomed,\nthan give up our lives to such a monster as this.  A noble youth,\ntherefore, was sent to ask the cat whether she would peaceably quit\nthe castle.  But the cat, whose thirst had become still greater,\nmerely answered, mew. Mew.  The youth understood her to say, \"Most\ncertainly not. Most certainly not.\" And took this answer to the king.\n\nThen, said the councillors, she shall yield to force. Cannon were\nbrought out, and the palace was soon in flames.  When the fire\nreached the room where the cat was sitting, she sprang safely out of\nthe window, but the besiegers did not leave off until the whole\npalace was shot down to the ground.\n", "How Six Men Got on in the World": "There was once a man who understood all kinds of arts.  He served in\nwar, and behaved well and bravely, but when the war was over he\nreceived his dismissal, and three farthings for his expenses on the\nway.  Wait, said he, I shall not be content with this. If I can only\nmeet with the right people, the king will yet have to give me all the\ntreasure of the country.\n\nThen full of anger he went into the forest, and saw a man standing\ntherein who had plucked up six trees as if they were blades of corn.\nHe said to him, will you be my servant and go with me.  Yes, he\nanswered, but, first, I will take this little bundle of sticks home\nto my mother, and he took one of the trees, and wrapped it round the\nfive others, lifted the bundle on his back, and carried it away. Then\nhe returned and went with his master, who said, we two ought to be\nable to get through the world very well, and when they had walked on\nfor a short while they found a huntsman who was kneeling, had\nshouldered his gun, and was about to fire.  The master said to him,\nhuntsman, what are you going to shoot.  He answered, two miles from\nhere a fly is sitting on the branch of an oak-tree, and I want to\nshoot its left eye out.\n\nOh, come with me, said the man, if we three are together, we\ncertainly ought to be able to get on in the world.  The huntsman was\nready, and went with him, and they came to seven windmills whose\nsails were turning round with great speed, and yet no wind was\nblowing either on the right or the left, and no leaf was stirring.\nThen said the man, I know not what is driving the windmills, not a\nbreath of air is stirring, and he went onwards with his servants, and\nwhen they had walked two miles they saw a man sitting on a tree who\nwas shutting one nostril, and blowing out of the other.  Good\ngracious.  What are you doing up there.\n\nHe answered, two miles from here are seven windmills.  Look, I am\nblowing them till they turn round.  Oh, come with me, said the man.\nIf we four are together, we shall carry the whole world before us.\nThen the blower came down and went with him, and after a while they\nsaw a man who was standing on one leg and had taken off the other,\nand laid it beside him.  Then the master said, you have arranged\nthings very comfortably to have a rest.\n\nI am a runner, he replied, and to stop myself running far too fast, I\nhave taken off one of my legs, for if I run with both, I go quicker\nthan any bird can fly.  Oh, go with me.  If we five are together, we\nshall carry the whole world before us.\n\nSo he went with them, and it was not long before they met a man who\nwore a cap, but wore it entirely over one ear.  Then the master said\nto him, gracefully, gracefully, don't stick your cap on one ear, you\nlook just like a tom-fool.  I must not wear it otherwise, said he,\nfor if I set my hat straight, a terrible frost comes on, and all the\nbirds in the air are frozen, and drop dead on the ground.  Oh, come\nwith me, said the master. If we six are together, we can carry the\nwhole world before us.\n\nNow the six came to a town where the king had proclaimed that\nwhosoever ran a race with his daughter and won the victory, should be\nher husband, but whosoever lost it, must lose his head.  Then the man\npresented himself and said, I will, however, let my servant run for\nme.  The king replied, then his life also must be staked, so that his\nhead and yours are both set on the victory.  When that was settled\nand made secure, the man buckled the other leg on the runner, and\nsaid to him, now be nimble, and help us to win.  It was fixed that\nthe one who was first to bring some water from a far distant well was\nto be the victor.  The runner received a pitcher, and the king's\ndaughter one too, and they began to run at the same time, but in an\ninstant, when the king's daughter had got a very little way, the\npeople who were looking on could see no more of the runner, and it\nwas just as if the wind had whistled by.  In a short time he reached\nthe well, filled his pitcher with water, and turned back.  Half-way\nhome, however, he was overcome with fatigue, and set his pitcher\ndown, lay down himself, and fell asleep.  But he had made a pillow of\na horse's skull which was lying on the ground, in order that he might\nlie uncomfortably, and soon wake up again.  In the meantime the\nking's daughter, who could also run very well - quite as well as any\nordinary mortal can - had reached the well, and was hurrying back\nwith her pitcher full of water, and when she saw the runner lying\nthere asleep, she was glad and said, my enemy is delivered over into\nmy hands, emptied his pitcher, and ran on.  And now all would have\nbeen lost if by good luck the huntsman had not been standing at the\ntop of the castle, and had not seen everything with his sharp eyes.\n\nThen said he, the king's daughter shall still not prevail against us.\nAnd he loaded his gun, and shot so cleverly, that he shot the horse's\nskull away from under the runner's head without hurting him.  Then\nthe runner awoke, leapt up, and saw that his pitcher was empty, and\nthat the king's daughter was already far in advance.  He did not lose\nheart, however, but ran back to the well with his pitcher, again drew\nsome water, and was at home again even ten minutes before the king's\ndaughter.  Behold, said he, only now have I begun to use my legs.\nWhat I did before did not deserve to be called running.\n\nBut it pained the king, and still more his daughter, that she should\nbe carried off by a common discharged soldier like that. So they took\ncounsel with each other how to get rid of him and his companions.\nThen said the king to her, I have thought of a way.  Don't be afraid,\nthey shall not come back again.  And he said to them, you shall now\nmake merry together, and eat and drink, and he conducted them to a\nroom which had a floor of iron, and the doors also were of iron, and\nthe windows were guarded with iron bars.  There was a table in the\nroom covered with delicious food, and the king said to them, go in,\nand enjoy yourselves.  And when they were inside, he ordered the\ndoors to be shut and bolted.  Then he sent for the cook, and\ncommanded him to make a fire under the room until the iron became\nred-hot.\n\nThis the cook did, and the six who were sitting at table began to\nfeel quite warm, and they thought the heat was caused by the food.\nBut as it became still greater, and they wanted to get out, and found\nthat the doors and windows were bolted, they became aware that the\nking must have an evil intention, and wanted to suffocate them.  He\nshall not succeed, however, said the one with the cap.  I will cause\na frost to come, before which the fire shall be ashamed, and creep\naway.\n\nThen he put his cap on straight, and immediately there came such a\nfrost that all heat disappeared, and the food on the dishes began to\nfreeze.  When an hour or two had passed by, and the king believed\nthat they had perished in the heat, he had the doors opened to behold\nthem himself.  But when the doors were opened, all six were standing\nthere, alive and well, and said that they should very much like to\nget out to warm themselves, for the very food was fast frozen to the\ndishes with the cold.  Then, full of anger, the king went down to the\ncook, scolded him, and asked why he had not done what he had been\nordered to do.  But the cook replied, there is heat enough there,\njust look yourself. Then the king saw that a fierce fire was burning\nunder the iron room, and perceived that there was no getting the\nbetter of the six in this way.\n\nAgain the king considered how to get rid of his unpleasant guests,\nand caused their chief to be brought and said, if you will take gold\nand renounce my daughter, you shall have as much as you will.\n\nOh, yes, lord king, he answered, give me as much as my servant can\ncarry, and I will not ask for your daughter.\n\nOn this the king was satisfied, and the other continued, in fourteen\ndays, I will come and fetch it.  Thereupon he summoned together all\nthe tailors in the whole kingdom, and they were to sit for fourteen\ndays and sew a sack.  And when it was ready, the strong one who could\ntear up trees had to take it on his back, and go with it to the king.\nThen said the king, who can that strong fellow be who is carrying a\nbundle of linen on his back that is as big as a house.  And he was\nalarmed and said, what a lot of gold he can carry away.  Then he\ncommanded a ton of gold to be brought, which took sixteen of his\nstrongest men to carry, but the strong one snatched it up in one\nhand, put it in his sack, and said, why don't you bring more at the\nsame time.  That hardly covers the bottom.  Then, little by little,\nthe king caused all his treasure to be brought thither, and the\nstrong one pushed it into the sack, and still the sack was not half\nfull with it.  Bring more, cried he, these few crumbs don't fill it.\n\nThen seven thousand carts with gold had to be gathered together in\nthe whole kingdom, and the strong one thrust them and the oxen\nharnessed to them into his sack.  I will examine it no longer, said\nhe, but will just take what comes, so long as the sack is but full.\nWhen all that was inside, there was still room for a great deal more.\nThen he said, I will just make an end of the thing.  People do\nsometimes tie up a sack even when it is not full.  So he took it on\nhis back, and went away with his comrades.  When the king now saw how\none single man was carrying away the entire wealth of the country, he\nbecame enraged, and bade his horsemen mount and pursue the six, and\nordered them to take the sack away from the strong one.  Two\nregiments speedily overtook the six, and called out, you are\nprisoners, put down the sack with the gold, or you will be cut to\npieces.  What say you, cried the blower, that we are prisoners.\n\nRather than that should happen, all of you shall dance about in the\nair.  And he closed one nostril, and with the other blew on the two\nregiments.  Then they were driven away from each other, and carried\ninto the blue sky over all the mountains, one here, the other there.\nOne sergeant cried for mercy.  He had nine wounds, and was a brave\nfellow who did not deserve ill treatment.\n\nThe blower stopped a little so that he came down without injury, and\nthen the blower said to him.  Now go home to your king, and tell him\nhe had better send some more horsemen, and I will blow them all into\nthe air.  When the king was informed of this he said, let the rascals\ngo.  There is magic in them.  Then the six conveyed the riches home,\ndivided it amongst them, and lived in content until their death.\n", "Gossip Wolf and the Fox": "The she-wolf brought into the world a young one, and invited the fox\nto be godfather.  After all, he is a near relative of ours, said she,\nhe has a good understanding, and much talent, he can instruct my\nlittle son, and help him forward in the world.  The fox, too,\nappeared quite honest, and said, worthy mrs. Gossip, I thank you for\nthe honor which you are doing me, I will, however, conduct myself in\nsuch a way that you shall be repaid for it.  He enjoyed himself at\nthe feast, and made merry, afterwards he said, dear mrs. Gossip, it\nis our duty to take care of the child, it must have good food that it\nmay be strong.  I know a sheep-fold from which we might fetch a nice\nmorsel.  The wolf was pleased with the idea, and she went out with\nthe fox to the farmyard.  He pointed out the fold from afar, and\nsaid, you will be able to creep in there without being seen, and in\nthe meantime I will look about on the other side to see if I can pick\nup a chicken.  He, however, did not go there, but sat down at the\nentrance to the forest, stretched his legs and rested.\n\nThe she-wolf crept into the stable.  A dog was lying there, and it\nmade such a noise that the peasants came running out, caught gossip\nwolf, and poured a strong burning mixture, which had been prepared\nfor washing, over her skin.  At last she escaped, and dragged herself\noutside.  There lay the fox, who pretended to be full of complaints,\nand said, ah, dear mrs. Gossip, how ill I have fared, the peasants\nhave fallen on me, and have broken every limb I have, if you do not\nwant me to lie where I am and perish, you must carry me away.  The\nshe-wolf herself was only able to walk slowly, but she was in such\nconcern about the fox that she took him on her back, and slowly\ncarried him who was perfectly safe and sound to her house.  Then the\nfox cried to her, farewell, dear mrs. Gossip, may the roasting you\nhave had do you good, laughed heartily at her, and bounded off.\n", "The Water-Nix": "A little brother and sister were once playing by a well, and while\nthey were thus playing, they both fell in.  A water-nixie lived down\nbelow, who said, now I have got you, now you shall work hard for me,\nand carried them off with her.  She gave the girl dirty tangled flax\nto spin, and she had to fetch water in a bucket with a hole in it,\nand the boy had to hew down a tree with a blunt axe, and they got\nnothing to eat but dumplings as hard as stones.\n\nThen at last the children became so impatient, that they waited until\none sunday, when the nixie was at church, and ran away.  But when\nchurch was over, the nixie saw that the birds were flown, and\nfollowed them with great strides.  The children saw her from afar,\nand the girl threw a brush behind her which formed an immense hill of\nbristles, with thousands and thousands of spikes, over which the\nnixie was forced to scramble with great difficulty, at last, however,\nshe got over.\n\nWhen the children saw this, the boy threw behind him a comb which\nmade a great ridge with a thousand times a thousand teeth, but the\nnixie managed to keep herself steady on them, and at last crossed\nover.  Then the girl threw behind her a looking-glass which formed a\nhill of mirrors, and was so slippery that it was impossible for the\nnixie to cross it.  Then she thought, I will go home quickly and\nfetch my axe, and cut the hill of glass in half.  Long before she\nreturned, however, and had hewn through the glass, the children had\nescaped to a great distance, and the water-nixie was obliged to\ntrundle back to her well again.\n\n", "Brother Lustig": "There was one upon a time a great war, and when it came to an end,\nmany soldiers were discharged.  Then brother lustig also received his\ndismissal, and with it nothing but a small loaf of ammunition-bread,\nand four kreuzers in money, with which he departed.\n\nSt. Peter, however, had placed himself in his way in the form of a\npoor beggar, and when brother lustig came up, he begged alms of him.\nBrother lustig replied, dear beggar-man, what am I to give you.  I\nhave been a soldier, and have received my dismissal, and have nothing\nbut this little loaf of ammunition-bread, and four kreuzers of money.\nWhen that is gone, I shall have to beg as well as you.  Still I will\ngive you something.\n\nThereupon he divided the loaf into four parts, and gave the apostle\none of them, and a kreuzer likewise.  St. Peter thanked him, went\nonwards, and threw himself again in the soldier's way as a beggar,\nbut in another shape, and when he came up begged a gift of him as\nbefore.\n\nBrother lustig spoke as he had done before, and again gave him a\nquarter of the loaf and one kreuzer.  St. Peter thanked him, and went\nonwards, but for the third time placed himself in another shape as a\nbeggar in the road, and spoke to brother lustig. Brother lustig gave\nhim also the third quarter of bread and the third kreuzer.  St. Peter\nthanked him, and brother lustig went onwards, and had but a quarter\nof the loaf, and one kreuzer.\n\nWith that he went into an inn, ate the bread, and ordered one\nkreuzer's worth of beer.  When he had had it, he journeyed onwards,\nand then St. Peter, who had assumed the appearance of a discharged\nsoldier, met and spoke to him thus.  Good day, comrade, can you not\ngive me a bit of bread, and a kreuzer to get a drink.  Where am I to\nprocure it, answered brother lustig. I have been discharged, and I\ngot nothing but a loaf of ammunition-bread and four kreuzers in\nmoney.  I met three beggars on the road, and I gave each of them a\nquarter of my bread, and one kreuzer.  The last quarter I ate in the\ninn, and had a drink with the last kreuzer.  Now my pockets are\nempty, and if you also have nothing we can go a-begging together.\n\nNo, answered St. Peter, we need not quite do that.  I know a little\nabout medicine, and I will soon earn as much as I require by that.\nIndeed, said brother lustig, I know nothing of that, so I must go and\nbeg alone.  Just come with me, said St. Peter, and if I earn\nanything, you shall have half of it.\n\nAll right, said brother lustig, and they went away together. Then\nthey came to a peasant's house inside which they heard loud\nlamentations and cries.  So they went in, and there the husband was\nlying sick unto death, and very near his end, and his wife was crying\nand weeping quite loudly.  Stop that howling and crying, said St.\nPeter, I will make the man well again, and he took a salve out of his\npocket, and healed the sick man in a moment, so that he could get up,\nand was in perfect health.\n\nIn great delight the man and his wife said, how can we reward you.\nWhat shall we give you.  But St. Peter would take nothing, and the\nmore the peasant folks offered him, the more he refused.  Brother\nlustig, however, nudged St. Peter, and said, take something.  Sure\nenough we are in need of it.\n\nAt length the woman brought a lamb and said to St. Peter that he\nreally must take that, but he would not. Then brother lustig gave him\na poke in the side, and said, do take it, you stupid fool.  We are in\ngreat want of it.  Then St. Peter said at last, well, I will take the\nlamb, but I won't carry it.  If you insist on having it, you must\ncarry it.  That is nothing, said brother lustig.  I will easily carry\nit, and took it on his shoulder.\n\nThen they departed and came to a wood, but brother lustig had begun\nto feel the lamb heavy, and he was hungry, so he said to St. Peter,\nlook, that's a good place, we might cook the lamb there, and eat it.\nAs you like, answered St. Peter, but I can't have anything to do with\nthe cooking.  If you will cook, there is a kettle for you, and in the\nmeantime I will walk about a little until it is ready.  But you must\nnot begin to eat until I have come back.  I will come at the right\ntime.  Well, go, then, said brother lustig.  I understand cookery, I\nwill manage it.\n\nThen St. Peter went away, and brother lustig killed the lamb, lighted\na fire, threw the meat into the kettle, and boiled it.  When the\nlamb, however, was quite ready, and the apostle peter had not come\nback, brother lustig took it out of the kettle, cut it up, and found\nthe heart. That is said to be the best part, said he, and tasted it,\nbut at last he ate it all up.  At length St. Peter returned and said,\nyou may eat the whole of the lamb yourself, I will only have the\nheart, give me that.\n\nThen brother lustig took a knife and fork, and pretended to look\nanxiously about amongst the lamb's flesh, but not to be able to find\nthe heart, and at last he said abruptly, there is none here.  But\nwhere can it be, said the apostle.  I don't know, replied brother\nlustig, but look, what fools we both are, to seek for the lamb's\nheart, and neither of us to remember that a lamb has no heart.  Oh,\nsaid St. Peter, that is something quite new.  Every animal has a\nheart, why is a lamb to have none.  No, be assured, my brother, said\nbrother lustig, that a lamb has no heart.  Just consider it\nseriously, and then you will see that it really has none.  Well, it\nis all right, said St. Peter.  If there is no heart, then I want none\nof the lamb.  You may eat it alone.\n\nWhat I can't eat now, I will carry away in my knapsack, said brother\nlustig, and he ate half the lamb, and put the rest in his knapsack.\n\nThey went farther, and then St. Peter caused a great stream of water\nto flow right across their path, and they were obliged to pass\nthrough it.  Said St. Peter, do you go first.  No, answered brother\nlustig, you must go first, and he thought, if the water is too deep I\nwill stay behind.  Then St. Peter strode through it, and the water\njust reached to his knee. So brother lustig began to go through also,\nbut the water grew deeper and reached to his throat.  Then he cried,\nbrother, help me.\n\nSt. Peter said, then will you confess that you have eaten the lamb's\nheart.  No, said he, I have not eaten it.  Then the water grew deeper\nstill and rose to his mouth.  Help me, brother, cried the soldier.\nSt. Peter said, then will you confess that you have eaten the lamb's\nheart.  No, he replied, I have not eaten it.  St. Peter, however,\nwould not let him be drowned, but made the water sink and helped him\nthrough it.\n\nThen they journeyed onwards, and came to a kingdom where they heard\nthat the king's daughter lay sick unto death.  Hi, there, brother,\nsaid the soldier to St. Peter, this is a chance for us.  If we can\nheal her we shall be provided for, for life.\n\nBut St. Peter was not half quick enough for him.  Come, lift your\nlegs, my dear brother, said he, that we may get there in time.  But\nSt. Peter walked slower and slower, though brother lustig did all he\ncould to drive and push him on, and at last they heard that the\nprincess was dead.  Now we are done for, said brother lustig.  That\ncomes of your sleepy way of walking.\n\nJust be quiet, answered St. Peter, I can do more than cure sick\npeople.  I can bring dead ones to life again.  Well, if you can do\nthat, said brother lustig, it's all right, but you should earn at\nleast half the kingdom for us by that.  Then they went to the royal\npalace, where everyone was in great grief, but St. Peter told the\nking that he would restore his daughter to life.  He was taken to\nher, and said, bring me a kettle and some water, and when that was\nbrought, he bade everyone go out, and allowed no one to remain with\nhim but brother lustig.  Then he cut off all the dead girl's limbs,\nand threw them in the water, lighted a fire beneath the kettle, and\nboiled them.  And when the flesh had fallen away from the bones, he\ntook out the beautiful white bones, and laid them on a table, and\narranged them together in their natural order.  When he had done\nthat, he stepped forward and said three times, in the name of the\nholy trinity, dead woman, arise.  And at the third time, the princess\narose, living, healthy and beautiful.\n\nThen the king was in the greatest joy, and said to St. Peter, ask for\nyour reward.  Even if it were half my kingdom, I would give it.  But\nSt. Peter said, I want nothing for it.  Oh, you tomfool, thought\nbrother lustig to himself, and nudged his comrade's side, and said,\ndon't be so stupid. If you have no need of anything, I have.  St.\nPeter, however, would have nothing, but as the king saw that the\nother would very much like to have something, he ordered his\ntreasurer to fill brother lustig's knapsack with gold.\n\nThen they went on their way, and when they came to a forest, St.\nPeter said to brother lustig, now, we will divide the gold.  Yes, he\nreplied, we will.  So St. Peter divided the gold, and divided it into\nthree heaps.  Brother lustig thought to himself, what crazy idea has\nhe got in his head now.  He is making three shares, and there are\nonly two of us.  But St. Peter said, I have divided it exactly.\nThere is one share for me, one for you and one for him who ate the\nlamb's heart.\n\nOh, I ate that, replied brother lustig, and hastily swept up the\ngold.  You may trust what I say.  But how can that be true, said St.\nPeter, when a lamb has no heart.  Eh, what, brother, what can you be\nthinking of.  Lambs have hearts like other animals, why should only\nthey have none.  Well, so be it, said St. Peter, keep the gold to\nyourself, but I will stay with you no longer.  I will go my way\nalone.  As you like, dear brother, answered brother lustig.\nFarewell.\n\nThen St. Peter went a different road, but brother lustig thought, it\nis a good thing that he has taken himself off, he is certainly a\nstrange saint.  Then he had money enough, but did not know how to\nmanage it, squandered it, gave it away, and and when some time had\ngone by, once more had nothing.  Then he arrived in a certain country\nwhere he heard that a king's daughter was dead.\n\nOh, ho, thought he, that may be a good thing for me.  I will bring\nher to life again, and see that I am paid as I ought to be.  So he\nwent to the king, and offered to raise the dead girl to life again.\nNow the king had heard that a discharged soldier was traveling about\nand bringing dead persons to life again, and thought that brother\nlustig was the man.  But as he had no confidence in him, he consulted\nhis councillors first, who said that he might give it a trial as his\ndaughter was dead.\n\nThen brother lustig ordered water to be brought to him in a kettle,\nbade every one go out, cut the limbs off, threw them in the water and\nlighted a fire beneath, just as he had seen St. Peter do.  The water\nbegan to boil, the flesh fell off, and then he took the bones out and\nlaid them on the table, but he did not know the order in which to lay\nthem, and placed them all wrong and in confusion.  Then he stood\nbefore them and said, in the name of the most holy trinity, dead\nmaiden, I bid you arise, and he said this thrice, but the bones did\nnot stir. So he said it thrice more, but also in vain.  Confounded\ngirl that you are, get up, cried he, get up, or it shall be the worse\nfor you.\n\nWhen he had said that, St. Peter suddenly appeared in his former\nshape as a discharged soldier.  He entered by the window and said,\ngodless man, what are you doing.  How can the dead maiden arise, when\nyou have thrown about her bones in such confusion.  Dear brother, I\nhave done everything to the best of my ability, he answered.  This\nonce, I will help you out of your difficulty, but one thing I tell\nyou, and that is that if ever you undertake anything of the kind\nagain, it will be the worse for you, and also that you must neither\ndemand nor accept the smallest thing from the king for this.\n\nThereupon St. Peter laid the bones in their right order, said to the\nmaiden three times, in the name of the most holy trinity, dead\nmaiden, arise, and the king's daughter arose, healthy and beautiful\nas before.  Then St. Peter went away again by the window, and brother\nlustig was rejoiced to find that all had passed off so well, but was\nvery much vexed to think that after all he was not to take anything\nfor it.  I should just like to know, thought he, what fancy that\nfellow has got in his head, for what he gives with one hand he takes\naway with the other - there is no sense whatever in it.\n\nThen the king offered brother lustig whatsoever he wished to have,\nbut he did not dare to take anything.  However, by hints and cunning,\nhe contrived to make the king order his knapsack to be filled with\ngold for him, and with that he departed.  When he got out, St. Peter\nwas standing by the door, and said, just look what a man you are.\nDid I not forbid you to take anything, and there you have your\nknapsack full of gold.  How can I help that, answered brother lustig,\nif people will put it in for me.  Well, I tell you this, that if ever\nyou set about anything of this kind again you shall suffer for it.\nAll right, brother, have no fear, now I have money, why should I\ntrouble myself with washing bones.  Faith, said St. Peter, a long\ntime that gold will last.  In order that after this you may never\ntread in forbidden paths, I will bestow on your knapsack this\nproperty, namely, that whatsoever you wish to have inside it, shall\nbe there.  Farewell, you will now never see me more.  Good-bye, said\nbrother lustig, and thought to himself, I am very glad that you have\ntaken yourself off, you strange fellow.  I shall certainly not follow\nyou.  But of the magical power which had been bestowed on his\nknapsack, he thought no more.\n\nBrother lustig traveled about with his money, and squandered and\nwasted what he had as before.  When at last he had no more than four\nkreuzers, he passed by an inn and thought, the money must go, and\nordered three kreuzers, worth of wine and one kreuzer's worth of\nbread for himself.  As he was sitting there drinking, the smell of\nroast goose made its way to his nose.\n\nBrother lustig looked about and peeped, and saw that the host had two\ngeese roasting in the oven.  Then he remembered that his comrade had\nsaid that whatsoever he wished to have in his knapsack should be\nthere, so he said, oh, ho.  I must try that with the geese.  So he\nwent out, and when he was outside the door, he said, I wish those two\nroasted geese out of the oven and in my knapsack, and when he had\nsaid that, he unbuckled it and looked in, and there they were inside\nit.  Ah, that's right, said he, now I am a made man, and went away to\na meadow and took out the roast meat.\n\nWhen he was in the midst of his meal, two journeymen came up and\nlooked at the second goose, which was not yet touched, with hungry\neyes.  Brother lustig thought to himself, one is enough for me, and\ncalled the two men up and said, take the goose, and eat it to my\nhealth.  They thanked him, and went with it to the inn, ordered\nthemselves a half bottle of wine and a loaf, took out the goose which\nhad been given them, and began to eat.\n\nThe hostess saw them and said to her husband, those two are eating a\ngoose.  Just look and see if it is not one of ours, out of the oven.\nThe landlord ran thither, and behold the oven was empty.  What, cried\nhe, you thievish crew, you want to eat goose as cheap as that.  Pay\nfor it this moment, or I will wash you well with green hazel-sap.\nThe two said, we are no thieves, a discharged soldier gave us the\ngoose, outside there in the meadow.  You shall not throw dust in my\neyes that way. The soldier was here, but he went out by the door,\nlike an honest fellow.  I looked after him myself.  You are the\nthieves and shall pay.  But as they could not pay, he took a stick,\nand cudgeled them out of the house.\n\nBrother lustig went his way and came to a place where there was a\nmagnificent castle, and not far from it a wretched inn. He went to\nthe inn and asked for a night's lodging, but the landlord turned him\naway, and said, there is no more room here, the house is full of\nnoble guests.  It surprises me that they should come to you and not\ngo to that splendid castle, said brother lustig.  Ah, indeed, replied\nthe host, but it is no slight matter to sleep there for a night.  No\none who has tried it so far, has ever come out of it alive.\n\nIf others have tried it, said brother lustig, I will try it too.\nLeave it alone, said the host, it will cost you your neck.  It won't\nkill me at once, said brother lustig, just give me the key, and some\ngood food and wine.  So the host gave him the key, and food and wine,\nand with this brother lustig went into the castle, enjoyed his\nsupper, and at length, as he was sleepy, he lay down on the ground,\nfor there was no bed.  He soon fell asleep, but during the night was\ndisturbed by a great noise, and when he awoke, he saw nine ugly\ndevils in the room, who had made a circle, and were dancing around\nhim.\n\nBrother lustig said, well, dance as long as you like, but none of you\nmust come too close.  But the devils pressed continually nearer to\nhim, and almost stepped on his face with their hideous feet.  Stop,\nyou devils, ghosts, said he, but they behaved still worse.  Then\nbrother lustig grew angry, and cried, stop.  You'll soon see how I\ncan make you quiet, and got the leg of a chair and struck out into\nthe midst of them with it.  But nine devils against one soldier were\nstill too many, and when he struck those in front of him, the others\nseized him behind by the hair, and tore it unmercifully.\n\nDevils, crew, cried he, this is too much, but just wait.  Into my\nknapsack, all nine of you.  In an instant they were in it, and then\nhe buckled it up and threw it into a corner.  After this all was\nsuddenly quiet, and brother lustig lay down again, and slept till it\nwas bright day.\n\nThen came the inn-keeper, and the nobleman to whom the castle\nbelonged, to see how he had fared.  But when they perceived that he\nwas merry and well they were astonished, and asked, have the spirits\ndone you no harm, then.  The reason why they have not, answered\nbrother lustig, is because I have got the whole nine of them in my\nknapsack.\n\nYou may once more inhabit your castle quite tranquilly, none of them\nwill ever haunt it again.  The nobleman thanked him, made him rich\npresents, and begged him to remain in his service, and he would\nprovide for him as long as he lived.  No, replied brother lustig, I\nam used to wandering about, I will travel farther.\n\nThen he went away, and entered into a smithy, laid the knapsack,\nwhich contained the nine devils on the anvil, and asked the smith and\nhis apprentices to strike it. So they smote with their great hammers\nwith all their strength, and the devils uttered howls which were\nquite pitiable.  When he opened the knapsack after this, eight of\nthem were dead, but one which had been lying in a fold of it, was\nstill alive, slipped out, and went back again to hell.\n\nThereupon brother lustig traveled a long time about the world, and\nthose who know, can tell many a story about him.  But at last he grew\nold, and thought of his end, so he went to a hermit who was known to\nbe a pious man, and said to him, I am tired of wandering about, and\nwant now to behave in such a manner that I shall enter into the\nkingdom of heaven.  The hermit replied, there are two roads, one is\nbroad and pleasant, and leads to hell, the other is narrow and rough,\nand leads to heaven.  I should be a fool, thought brother lustig, if\nI were to take the narrow, rough road.\n\nSo he set out and took the broad and pleasant road, and at length\ncame to a great black door, which was the door of hell.  Brother\nlustig knocked, and the door-keeper peeped out to see who was there.\nBut when he saw brother lustig, he was terrified, for he was the very\nsame ninth devil who had been shut up in the knapsack, and had\nescaped from it with a black eye.\n\nSo he pushed the bolt in again as quickly as he could, ran to the\nhighest devil, and said, there is a fellow outside with a knapsack,\nwho wants to come in, but as you value your lives don't allow him to\nenter, or he will wish the whole of hell into his knapsack.  He once\ngave me a frightful hammering when I was inside it.\n\nSo they called out to brother lustig that he was to go away again,\nfor he should not get in there.  If they won't have me here, thought\nhe, I will see if I can find a place for myself in heaven, for I must\nstay somewhere.\n\nSo he turned about and went onwards until he came to the door of\nheaven, where he knocked.  St. Peter was sitting hard by as\ndoor-keeper.  Brother lustig recognized him at once, and thought,\nhere I find an old friend, I shall get on better.  But St. Peter\nsaid, I can hardly believe that you want to come into heaven.  Let me\nin, brother.  I must get in somewhere.  If they would have taken me\ninto hell, I should not have come here.  No, said St. Peter, you\nshall not enter.  Then if you will not let me in, take your knapsack\nback, for I will have nothing at all from you.  Give it here, then,\nsaid St. Peter.  Then brother lustig gave him the knapsack into\nheaven through the bars, and St. Peter took it, and hung it beside\nhis seat.  Then said brother lustig, and now I wish myself inside my\nknapsack, and in a second he was in it, and in heaven, and St. Peter\nwas forced to let him stay there.\n", "Hans Married": "There was once upon a time a young peasant named Hans, whose uncle\nwanted to find him a rich wife.  He therefore seated Hans behind the\nstove, and had it made very hot.  Then he fetched a pot of milk and\nplenty of white bread, gave him a bright newly-coined farthing in his\nhand, and said, Hans, hold that farthing fast, crumble the white\nbread into the milk, and stay where you are, and do not stir from\nthat spot till I come back.  Yes, said Hans,\n\nI will do all that.  Then the uncle put on a pair of old patched\ntrousers, went to a rich peasant's daughter in the next village, and\nsaid, won't you marry my nephew Hans.  You will get an honest and\nsensible man who will suit you.  The covetous father asked, how is it\nwith regard to his means.  Has he bread to break?\n\nDear friend, replied the uncle, my young nephew has a snug berth, a\nnice bit of money in hand, and plenty of bread to break, besides he\nhas quite as many patches as I have.  And as he spoke, he slapped the\npatches on his trousers, but in that district small pieces of land\nwere called patches also.  If you will give yourself the trouble to\ngo home with me, you shall see at once that all is as I have said.\nThen the miser did not want to lose this good opportunity, and said,\nif that is the case, I have nothing further to say against the\nmarriage.\n\nSo the wedding was celebrated on the appointed day, and when the\nyoung wife went out of doors to see the bridegroom's property, Hans\ntook off his sunday coat and put on his patched smock and said, I\nmight spoil my good coat.  Then together they went out and wherever a\nvineyard came in sight, or fields and meadows were divided from each\nother, Hans pointed with his finger and then slapped either a large\nor a small patch on his smock, and said, that patch is mine, and that\ntoo, my dearest, just look at it. Meaning thereby that his wife\nshould not stare at the broad land, but look at his garment, which\nwas his own.\n\nWere you at the wedding too?  Yes, indeed I was there, and in full\ndress.  My head-dress was of snow, then the sun came out, and it was\nmelted.  My coat was of cobwebs, and I had to pass by some thorns\nwhich tore it off me, my shoes were of glass, and I trod on a stone\nand they said, klink, and broke in two.\n\n", "The Gold-Children": "There was once a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a\nlittle cottage, and who earned their bread by fishing, and always\nlived from hand to mouth.  But it came to pass one day when the man\nwas sitting by the water-side, and casting his net, that he drew out\na fish entirely of gold.  As he was looking at the fish, full of\nastonishment, it began to speak and said, listen, fisherman, if you\nwill throw me back again into the water, I will change your little\nhut into a splendid castle.\n\nThen the fisherman answered, of what use is a castle to me, if I have\nnothing to eat.  The gold fish continued, that shall be taken care\nof, there will be a cupboard in the castle in which, when you open\nit, shall be dishes of the most delicate meats, and as many of them\nas you can desire.  If that be true, said the man, then I can well do\nyou a favor.  Yes, said the fish, there is, however, the condition\nthat you shall disclose to no one in the world, whosoever he may be,\nwhence your good luck has come, if you speak but one single word, all\nwill be over.  Then the man threw the wonderful fish back again into\nthe water, and went home.\n\nBut where his hovel had formerly stood, now stood a great castle. He\nopened wide his eyes, entered, and saw his wife dressed in beautiful\nclothes, sitting in a splendid room, and she was quite delighted, and\nsaid, husband, how has all this come to pass.  It suits me very well.\nYes, said the man, it suits me too, but I am frightfully hungry, just\ngive me something to eat.  Said the wife, but I have got nothing and\ndon't know where to find anything in this new house.  There is no\nneed of your knowing, said the man, for I see yonder a great\ncupboard, just unlock it. When she opened it, there stood cakes,\nmeat, fruit, wine, quite a bright prospect.\n\nThen the woman cried joyfully, what more can you want, my dear. And\nthey sat down, and ate and drank together.  When they had had enough,\nthe woman said, but husband, whence come all these riches. Alas,\nanswered he, do not question me about it, for I dare not tell you\nanything.  If I disclose it to anyone, then all our good fortune will\ndisappear.  Very good, said she, if I am not to know anything, then I\ndo not want to know anything.  However, she was not in earnest.  She\nnever rested day or night, and she goaded her husband until in his\nimpatience he revealed that all was owing to a wonderful golden fish\nwhich he had caught, and to which in return he had given its liberty.\nAnd as soon as the secret was out, the splendid castle with the\ncupboard immediately disappeared, they were once more in the old\nfisherman's hut, and the man was obliged to follow his former trade\nand fish.\n\nBut fortune would so have it, that he once more drew out the golden\nfish.  Listen, said the fish, if you will throw me back into the\nwater again, I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard\nfull of roast and boiled meats.  Only be firm, for your life's sake\ndon't reveal from whom you have it, or you will lose it all again.  I\nwill take good care, answered the fisherman, and threw the fish back\ninto the water.  Now at home everything was once more in its former\nmagnificence, and the wife was overjoyed at their good fortune, but\ncuriosity left her no peace, so that after a couple of days she began\nto ask again how it had come to pass, and how he had managed to\nsecure it.  The man kept silence for a short time, but at last she\nmade him so angry that he broke out, and betrayed the secret.\n\nIn an instant the castle disappeared, and they were back again in\ntheir old hut.  Now you have got what you want, said he, and we can\ngnaw at a bare bone again.  Ah, said the woman, I had rather not have\nriches if I am not to know from whom they come, for then I have no\npeace.\n\nThe man went back to fish, and after a while he chanced to draw out\nthe gold fish for a third time.  Listen, said the fish, I see very\nwell that I am fated to fall into your hands, take me home and cut me\ninto six pieces.  Give your wife two of them to eat, two to your\nhorse and bury two of them in the ground, then they will bring you a\nblessing.  The fisherman took the fish home with him, and did as it\nhad bidden him.  It came to pass, however, that from the two pieces\nthat were buried in the ground two golden lilies sprang up, that the\nhorse had two golden foals, and the fisherman's wife bore two\nchildren who were made entirely of gold.  The children grew up,\nbecame tall and handsome, and the lilies and horses grew likewise.\nThen they said, father, we want to mount our golden steeds and travel\nout in the world.  But he answered sorrowfully, how shall I bear it\nif you go away, and I know not how it fares with you.  Then they\nsaid, the two golden lilies remain here.  By them you can see how it\nis with us.  If they are fresh, then we are in health.  If they are\nwithered, we are ill.  If they perish, then we are dead.\n\nSo they rode forth and came to an inn, in which were many people, and\nwhen they perceived the gold-children they began to laugh, and jeer.\nWhen one of them heard the mocking he felt ashamed and would not go\nout into the world, but turned back and went home again to his\nfather.  But the other rode forward and reached a great forest. As he\nwas about to enter it, the people said, it is not safe for you to\nride through, the wood is full of robbers who would treat you badly.\nYou will fare ill, and when they see that you are all of gold, and\nyour horse likewise, they will assuredly kill you.\n\nBut he would not allow himself to be frightened, and said, I must and\nwill ride through it.  Then he took bear-skins and covered himself\nand his horse with them, so that the gold was no more to be seen, and\nrode fearlessly into the forest.  When he had ridden onward a little\nhe heard a rustling in the bushes, and heard voices speaking\ntogether.  From one side came cries of, there is one, but from the\nother, let him go, 'tis a bearskin, as poor and bare as a\nchurch-mouse, what should we gain from him.  So the gold-child rode\njoyfully through the forest, and no evil befell him.\n\nOne day he entered a village wherein he saw a maiden, who was so\nbeautiful that he did not believe that any more beautiful than she\nexisted in the world.  And as such a mighty love took possession of\nhim, he went up to her and said, I love you with my whole heart, will\nyou be my wife.  He, too, pleased the maiden so much that she agreed\nand said, yes, I will be your wife, and be true to you my whole life\nlong.\n\nThen they were married, and just as they were in the greatest\nhappiness, home came the father of the bride, and when he saw that\nhis daughter's wedding was being celebrated, he was astonished, and\nsaid, where is the bridegroom.  They showed him the gold-child, who,\nhowever, still wore his bear-skins.  Then the father said wrathfully,\na bearskin shall never have my daughter.  And was about to kill him.\nThen the bride begged as hard as she could, and said, he is my\nhusband, and I love him with all my heart.  Until at last he allowed\nhimself to be appeased.  Nevertheless the idea never left his\nthoughts, so that next morning he rose early, wishing to see whether\nhis daughter's husband was a common ragged beggar.  But when he\npeeped in, he saw a magnificent golden man in the bed, and the\ncast-off bear-skins lying on the ground.  Then he went back and\nthought, what a good thing it was that I restrained my anger.  I\nwould have committed a great crime.\n\nBut the gold-child dreamed that he rode out to hunt a splendid stag,\nand when he awoke in the morning, he said to his wife, I must go out\nhunting.  She was uneasy, and begged him to stay there, and said, you\nmight easily meet with a great misfortune.  But he answered, I must\nand will go.\n\nThereupon he got up, and rode forth into the forest, and it was not\nlong before a fine stag crossed his path exactly according to his\ndream.  He aimed and was about to shoot it, when the stag ran away.\nHe gave chase over hedges and ditches for the whole day without\nfeeling tired, but in the evening the stag vanished from his sight,\nand when the gold-child looked round him, he was standing before a\nlittle house, wherein sat a witch.\n\nHe knocked and a little old woman came out and asked, what are you\ndoing so late in the midst of the great forest.  Have you not seen a\nstag. Yes, answered she, I know the stag well.  And thereupon a\nlittle dog which had come out of the house with her, barked at the\nman violently.  Will you be silent, you odious toad, said he, or I\nwill shoot you dead.  Then the witch cried out in a passion, what\nwill you slay my little dog.  And immediately transformed him, so\nthat he lay like a stone, and his bride awaited him in vain and\nthought, that which I so greatly dreaded, which lay so heavily on my\nheart, has come upon him.\n\nBut at home the other brother was standing by the gold-lilies, when\none of them suddenly drooped. Good heavens, said he, my brother has\nmet with some great misfortune I must away to see if I can possibly\nrescue him.  Then the father said, stay here, if I lose you also,\nwhat shall I do. But he answered, I must and will go forth.\n\nThen he mounted his golden horse, and rode forth and entered the\ngreat forest, where his brother lay turned to stone.  The old witch\ncame out of her house and called him, wishing to entrap him also, but\nhe did not go near her, and said, I will shoot you, if you will not\nbring my brother to life again.  She touched the stone, though very\nunwillingly, with her forefinger, and he was immediately restored to\nhis human shape.  And the two gold-children rejoiced when they saw\neach other again, kissed and caressed each other, and rode away\ntogether out of the forest the one home to his bride, and the other\nto his father.\n\nThe father then said, I knew well that you had rescued your brother,\nfor the golden lily suddenly rose up and blossomed out again. Then\nthey lived happily, and they prospered until their death.\n", "The Singing, Soaring Lark": "There was once upon a time a man who was about to set out on a long\njourney, and on parting he asked his three daughters what he should\nbring back with him for them.  Whereupon the eldest wished for\npearls, the second wished for diamonds, but the third said, dear\nfather, I should like a singing, soaring lark.  The father said, yes,\nif I can get it, you shall have it, kissed all three, and set out.\n\nNow when the time had come for him to be on his way home again, he\nhad brought pearls and diamonds for the two eldest, but he had sought\neverywhere in vain for a singing, soaring lark for the youngest, and\nhe was very unhappy about it, for she was his favorite child.  Then\nhis road lay through a forest, and in the midst of it was a splendid\ncastle, and near the castle stood a tree, but quite on the top of the\ntree, he saw a singing, soaring lark.  Aha, you come just at the\nright moment, he said, quite delighted, and called to his servant to\nclimb up and catch the little creature.\n\nBut as he approached the tree, a lion leapt from beneath it, shook\nhimself, and roared till the leaves on the trees trembled.  He who\ntries to steal my singing, soaring lark, he cried, will I devour.\nThen the man said, I did not know that the bird belonged to you.  I\nwill make amends for the wrong I have done and ransom myself with a\nlarge sum of money, only spare my life.  The lion said, nothing can\nsave you, unless you will promise to give me for my own what first\nmeets you on your return home, and if you will do that, I will grant\nyou your life, and you shall have the bird for your daughter, into\nthe bargain.  But the man hesitated and said, that might be my\nyoungest daughter, she loves me best, and always runs to meet me on\nmy return home.\n\nThe servant, however, was terrified and said, why should your\ndaughter be the very one to meet you, it might as easily be a cat, or\ndog. Then the man allowed himself to be persuaded, took the singing,\nsoaring lark, and promised to give the lion whatsoever should first\nmeet him on his return home.\n\nWhen he reached home and entered his house, the first who met him was\nno other than his youngest and dearest daughter, who came running up,\nkissed and embraced him, and when she saw that he had brought with\nhim a singing, soaring lark, she was beside herself with joy.  The\nfather, however, could not rejoice, but began to weep, and said, my\ndearest child, I have bought the little bird dear.  In return for it,\nI have been obliged to promise you to a savage lion, and when he has\nyou he will tear you in pieces and devour you, and he told her all,\njust as it had happened, and begged her not to go there, come what\nmight.\n\nBut she consoled him and said, dearest father, indeed your promise\nmust be fulfilled.  I will go thither and soften the lion, so that I\nmay return to you safely.  Next morning she had the road pointed out\nto her, took leave, and went fearlessly out into the forest.  The\nlion, however, was an enchanted prince and was by day a lion, and all\nhis people were lions with him, but in the night they resumed their\nnatural human shapes.\n\nOn her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle.  When\nnight came, the lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding\nwas celebrated with great magnificence.  They lived happily together,\nremained awake at night, and slept in the daytime.  One day he came\nand said, to-morrow there is a feast in your father's house, because\nyour eldest sister is to be married, and if you are inclined to go\nthere, my lions shall conduct you.  She said, yes, I should very much\nlike to see my father again, and went thither, accompanied by the\nlions.\n\nThere was great joy when she arrived, for they had all believed that\nshe had been torn in pieces by the lion, and had long ceased to live.\nBut she told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off\nshe was, remained with them while the wedding-feast lasted, and then\nwent back again to the forest.\n\nWhen the second daughter was about to be married, and she was again\ninvited to the wedding, she said to the lion, this time I will not be\nalone, you must come with me.  The lion, however, said that it was\ntoo dangerous for him, for if when there a ray from a burning candle\nfell on him, he would be changed into a dove, and for seven years\nlong would have to fly about with the doves.  She said, ah, but do\ncome with me, I will take great care of you, and guard you from all\nlight.  So they went away together, and took with them their little\nchild as well.\n\nShe had a room built there, so strong and thick that no ray could\npierce through it, in this he was to shut himself up when the candles\nwere lit for the wedding-feast.  But the door was made of green wood\nwhich warped and left a little crack which no one noticed.  The\nwedding was celebrated with magnificence, but when the procession\nwith all its candles and torches came back from church, and passed by\nthis apartment, a ray touched him, he was transformed in an instant,\nand when she came in and looked for him, she did not see him, but a\nwhite dove was sitting there.  The dove said to her, for seven years\nmust I fly about the world, but at every seventh step that you take I\nwill let fall a drop of red blood and a white feather, and these will\nshow you the way, and if you follow the trace you can release me.\nThereupon the dove flew out at the door, and she followed him, and at\nevery seventh step a red drop of blood and a little white feather\nfell down and showed her the way.\n\nSo she went continually further and further in the wide world, never\nlooking about her or resting, and the seven years were almost past,\nthen she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be saved, and yet\nthey were so far from it.  Once when they were thus moving onwards,\nno little feather and no drop of red blood fell, and when she raised\nher eyes the dove had disappeared.  And as she thought to herself, in\nthis no man can help you, she climbed up to the sun, and said to him,\nyou shine into every crevice, and over every peak, have you not seen\na white dove flying.\n\nNo, said the sun, I have seen none, but I present you with a casket,\nopen it when you are in sorest need.  Then she thanked the sun, and\nwent on until evening came and the moon appeared, she then asked her,\nyou shine the whole night through, and on every field and forest,\nhave you not seen a white dove flying.\n\nNo, said the moon, I have seen no dove, but here I give you an egg,\nbreak it when you are in great need.  She thanked the moon, and went\non until the night wind came up and blew on her, then she said to it,\nyou blow over every tree and under every leaf, have you not seen a\nwhite dove flying.  No, said the night wind, I have seen none, but I\nwill ask the three other winds, perhaps they have seen it.\n\nThe east wind and the west wind came, and had seen nothing, but the\nsouth wind said, I have seen the white dove, it has flown to the red\nsea, where it has become a lion again, for the seven years are over,\nand the lion is there fighting with a dragon, the dragon, however, is\nan enchanted princess.  The night wind then said to her, I will\nadvise you, go to the red sea, on the right bank are some tall reeds,\ncount them, break off the eleventh, and strike the dragon with it,\nthen the lion will be able to subdue it, and both then will regain\ntheir human form.  After that, look round and you will see the\ngriffin which is by the red sea, swing yourself, with your beloved,\non to his back, and the bird will carry you over the sea to your own\nhome.  Here is a nut for you, when you are above the center of the\nsea, let the nut fall, it will immediately shoot up, and a tall\nnut-tree will grow out of the water on which the griffin may rest,\nfor if he cannot rest, he will not be strong enough to carry you\nacross, and if you forget to throw down the nut, he will let you fall\ninto the sea.\n\nThen she went thither, and found everything as the night wind had\nsaid.  She counted the reeds by the sea, and cut off the eleventh,\nstruck the dragon therewith, whereupon the lion conquered it, and\nimmediately both of them regained their human shapes.  But when the\nprincess, who hitherto had been the dragon, was released from\nenchantment, she took the youth by the arm, seated herself on the\ngriffin, and carried him off with her.\n\nThere stood the poor maiden who had wandered so far and was again\nforsaken.  She sat down and cried, but at last she took courage and\nsaid, still I will go as far as the wind blows and as long as the\ncock crows, until I find him, and she went forth by long, long roads,\nuntil at last she came to the castle where both of them were living\ntogether, there she heard that soon a feast was to be held, in which\nthey would celebrate their wedding, but she said, God still helps me,\nand opened the casket that the sun had given her.  A dress lay\ntherein as brilliant as the sun itself.  So she took it out and put\nit on, and went up into the castle, and everyone, even the bride\nherself, looked at her with astonishment.\n\nThe dress pleased the bride so well that she thought it might do for\nher wedding-dress, and asked if it was for sale.  Not for money or\nland, answered she, but for flesh and blood.  The bride asked her\nwhat she meant by that, so she said, let me sleep a night in the\nchamber where the bridegroom sleeps.  The bride would not, yet wanted\nvery much to have the dress, at last she consented, but the page was\nto give the prince a sleeping-draught.\n\nWhen it was night, therefore, and the youth was already asleep, she\nwas led into the chamber, she seated herself on the bed and said, I\nhave followed after you for seven years.  I have been to the sun and\nthe moon, and the four winds, and have enquired for you, and have\nhelped you against the dragon, will you, then quite forget me.  But\nthe prince slept so soundly that it only seemed to him as if the wind\nwere whistling outside in the fir-trees.\n\nWhen therefore day broke, she was led out again, and had to give up\nthe golden dress.  And as that even had been of no avail, she was\nsad, went out into a meadow, sat down there, and wept.  While she was\nsitting there, she thought of the egg which the moon had given her,\nshe opened it, and there came out a clucking hen with twelve chickens\nall of gold, and they ran about chirping, and crept again under the\nold hen's wings, nothing more beautiful was ever seen in the world.\nThen she arose, and drove them through the meadow before her, until\nthe bride looked out of the window.\n\nThe little chickens pleased her so much that she immediately came\ndown and asked if they were for sale.  Not for money or land, but for\nflesh and blood, let me sleep another night in the chamber where the\nbridegroom sleeps.  The bride said, yes, intending to cheat her as on\nthe former evening.  But when the prince went to bed he asked the\npage what the murmuring and rustling in the night had been.  On this\nthe page told all, that he had been forced to give him a\nsleeping-draught, because a poor girl had slept secretly in the\nchamber, and that he was to give him another that night.  The prince\nsaid, pour out the draught by the bed-side.\n\nAt night, she was again led in, and when she began to relate how ill\nall had fared with her, he immediately recognized his beloved wife by\nher voice, sprang up and cried, now I really am released.  I have\nbeen as it were in a dream, for the strange princess has bewitched me\nso that I have been compelled to forget you, but God has delivered me\nfrom the spell at the right time.\n\nThen they both left the castle secretly in the night, for they feared\nthe father of the princess, who was a sorcerer, and they seated\nthemselves on the griffin which bore them across the red sea, and\nwhen they were in the midst of it, she let fall the nut.  Immediately\na tall nut-tree grew up, whereon the bird rested, and then carried\nthem home, where they found their child, who had grown tall and\nbeautiful, and they lived thenceforth happily until their death.\n", "The Young Giant": "Once upon a time a countryman had a son who was as big as a thumb,\nand did not become any bigger, and during several years did not grow\none hair's breadth.  Once when the father was going out to plough,\nthe little one said, father, I will go out with you. You would go out\nwith me, said the father.  Stay here, you will be of no use out\nthere, besides you might get lost.  Then thumbling began to cry, and\nfor the sake of peace his father put him in his pocket, and took him\nwith him.\n\nWhen he was outside in the field, he took him out again, and set him\nin a freshly cut furrow.  Whilst he sat there, a great giant came\nover the hill.  Do you see that great bogie, said the father, for he\nwanted to frighten the little fellow to make him behave well, he is\ncoming to fetch you.  The giant, however, had scarcely taken two\nsteps with his long legs before he was in the furrow.\n\nHe took up little thumbling carefully with two fingers, examined him,\nand without saying one word went away with him. His father stood by,\nbut could not utter a sound for terror, and he thought nothing else\nbut that his child was lost, and that as long as he lived he should\nnever set eyes on him again.\n\nBut the giant carried him home, let him suckle at his breast, and\nthumbling grew and became tall and strong after the manner of giants.\nWhen two years had passed, the old giant took him into the forest,\nwanted to test him, and said, pull up a stick for yourself.  Then the\nboy was already so strong that he tore up a young tree out of the\nearth by the roots.  But the giant thought, we must do better than\nthat, took him back again, and suckled him two years longer.  When he\ntested him, his strength had increased so much that he could tear an\nold tree out of the ground.\n\nThat was still not enough for the giant, he again suckled him for two\nyears, and when he then went with him into the forest and said, now\njust tear up a real stick, the boy tore up the biggest oak-tree from\nthe earth, so that it cracked, and that was a mere trifle to him.\nNow that will do, said the giant, you are perfect.  And took him back\nto the field from whence he had brought him.  His father was there\nfollowing the plough.  The young giant went up to him, and said, does\nmy father see what a fine man his son has grown into.\n\nThe farmer was alarmed, and said, no, you are not my son.  I don't\nwant you - leave me.  Truly I am your son, allow me to do your work,\nI can plough as well as you, nay better.  No, no, you are not my son,\nand you can not plough - go away.  However, as he was afraid of this\ngreat man, he let go of the plough, stepped back and sat down at the\nside of the land.  Then the youth took the plough, and just grasped\nit with one hand, but his pressure was so strong that the plough went\ndeep into the earth.\n\nThe farmer could not bear to see that, and called to him, if you are\ndetermined to plough, you must not press so hard on it, that makes\nbad work.  The youth, however, unharnessed the horses, and drew the\nplough himself, saying, just go home, father, and bid my mother make\nready a large dish of food, and in the meantime I will go over the\nfield.  Then the farmer went home, and ordered his wife to prepare\nthe food, but the youth ploughed the field which was two acres large,\nquite alone, and then he harnessed himself to the harrow, and\nharrowed the whole of the land, using two harrows at once.  When he\nhad done it, he went into the forest, and pulled up two oak-trees,\nlaid them across his shoulders, and hung on them one harrow behind\nand one before, and also one horse behind and one before, and carried\nall as if it had been a bundle of straw, to his parents, house.\n\nWhen he entered the yard, his mother did not recognize him, and\nasked, who is that horrible tall man.  The father said, that is our\nson.  She said, no that cannot be our son, we never had such a tall\none, ours was a little thing.  She called to him, go away, we do not\nwant you.  The youth was silent, but led his horses to the stable,\ngave them some oats and hay, and all that they wanted.  When he had\ndone this, he went into the parlor, sat down on the bench and said,\nmother, now I should like something to eat, will it soon be ready?\nShe said, yes, and brought in two immense dishes full of food, which\nwould have been enough to satisfy herself and her husband for a week.\nThe youth, however, ate the whole of it himself, and asked if she had\nnothing more to set before him.  No, she replied, that is all we\nhave.  But that was only a taste, I must have more.\n\nShe did not dare to oppose him, and went and put a huge pig's trough\nfull of food on the fire, and when it was ready, carried it in.  At\nlength come a few crumbs, said he, and gobbled all there was, but it\nwas still not sufficient to appease his hunger.  Then said he,\nfather, I see well that with you I shall never have food enough, if\nyou will get me an iron staff which is strong, and which I cannot\nbreak against my knees, I will go out into the world.  The farmer was\nglad, put his two horses in his cart, and fetched from the smith a\nstaff so large and thick, that the two horses could only just bring\nit away.\n\nThe youth laid it across his knees, and snap, he broke it in two in\nthe middle like a bean-stalk, and threw it away. The father then\nharnessed four horses, and brought a bar which was so long and thick,\nthat the four horses could only just drag it.  The son snapped this\nalso in twain against his knees, threw it away, and said, father,\nthis can be of no use to me, you must harness more horses, and bring\na stronger staff.  So the father harnessed eight horses, and brought\none which was so long and thick, that the eight horses could only\njust carry it. When the son took it in his hand, he immediately\nsnapped off the end of it, and said, father, I see that you will not\nbe able to procure me any such staff as I want, I will remain no\nlonger with you.\n\nSo he went away, and gave out that he was a smith's apprentice. He\narrived at a village, wherein lived a smith who was a stingy fellow,\nwho never did a kindness to any one, but wanted everything for\nhimself.  The youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a\njourneyman.  Yes, said the smith, and looked at him, and thought,\nthat is a strong fellow who will strike out well, and earn his bread.\nSo he asked, how much wages do you want.\n\nI don't want any at all, he replied, only every fortnight, when the\nother journeymen are paid, I will give you two blows, and you must\nbear them.  The miser was heartily satisfied, and thought he would\nthus save much money.  Next morning, the strange journeyman was to\nbegin to work, but when the master brought the glowing bar, and the\nyouth struck his first blow, the iron flew asunder, and the anvil\nsank so deep into the earth, that there was no bringing it out again.\nThen the miser grew angry, and said, oh, but I can't make any use of\nyou, you strike far too powerfully.  How much will you have for the\none blow.\n\nThen said he, I will give you only quite a small blow, that's all.\nAnd he raised his foot, and gave him such a kick that he flew away\nover four loads of hay.  Then he sought out the thickest iron bar in\nthe smithy for himself, took it as a stick in his hand and went\nonwards.\n\nWhen he had walked for some time, he came to a small farm, and asked\nthe bailiff if he did not require a head-man.  Yes, said the bailiff,\nI can make use of one.  You look a capable fellow who can do\nsomething, how much a year do you want as wages.  He again replied\nthat he wanted no wages at all, but that every year he would give him\nthree blows, which he must bear.  Then the bailiff was satisfied, for\nhe, too, was a covetous fellow.  Next morning all the servants were\nto go into the wood, and the others were already up, but the head-man\nwas still in bed.  Then one of them called to him, get up, it is\ntime, we are going into the wood, and you must go with us.  Ah, said\nhe quite roughly and surlily, you may just go, then, I shall be back\nagain before any of you.  Then the others went to the bailiff, and\ntold him that the head-man was still lying in bed, and would not go\ninto the wood with them.  The bailiff said they were to awaken him\nagain, and tell him to harness the horses.  The head-man, however,\nsaid as before, just go there, I shall be back again before any of\nyou.  And then he stayed in bed two hours longer.  At length he arose\nfrom the feathers, but first he got himself two bushels of peas from\nthe loft, made himself some broth, ate it at his leisure, and when\nthat was done, went and harnessed the horses, and drove into the\nwood.\n\nNot far from the wood was a ravine through which he had to pass, so\nhe first drove the horses on, and then stopped them, and went behind\nthe cart, took trees and brushwood, and made a great barricade, so\nthat no horse could get through.  When he was entering the wood, the\nothers were just driving out of it with their loaded carts to go\nhome.  Then said he to them, drive on, I will still get home before\nyou do.  He did not drive far into the wood, but at once tore two of\nthe very largest trees of all out of the earth, threw them on his\ncart, and turned round.  When he came to the barricade, the others\nwere still standing there, not able to get through.  Don't you see,\nsaid he, that if you had stayed with me, you would have got home just\nas quickly, and would have had another hour's sleep.  He now wanted\nto drive on, but his horeses could not work their way through, so he\nunharnessed them, laid them on the top of the cart, took the shafts\nin his own hands, and pulled it all through, and he did this just as\neasily as if it had been laden with feathers. When he was over, he\nsaid to the others, there, you see, I have got over quicker than you.\nAnd drove on, and the others had to stay where they were.  In the\nyard, however, he took a tree in his hand, showed it to the bailiff,\nand said, isn't that a fine cord of wood.\n\nThen said the bailiff to his wife, the servant is a good one - even\nif he does sleep long, he is still home before the others.  So he\nserved the bailiff for a year, and when that was over, and the other\nservants were getting their wages, he said it was time for him to\ntake his too.  The bailiff, however, was afraid of the blows which he\nwas to receive, and earnestly entreated him to excuse him from having\nthem, for rather than that, he himself would be head-man, and the\nyouth should be bailiff.  No said he, I will not be a bailiff, I am\nhead-man, and will remain so, but I will administer that which we\nagreed on.  The bailiff was willing to give him whatsoever he\ndemanded, but it was of no use, the head-man said no to everything.\n\nThen the bailiff did not know what to do, and begged for a\nfortnight's delay, for he wanted to find some way of escape. The\nhead-man consented to this delay.  The bailiff summoned all his\nclerks together, and they were to think the matter over, and give him\nadvice.  The clerks pondered for a long time, but at last they said\nthat no one was sure of his life with head-man, for he could kill a\nman as easily as a midge, and that the bailiff ought to make him get\ninto the well and clean it, and when he was down below, they would\nroll up one of the mill-stones which was lying there, and throw it on\nhis head, and then he would never return to daylight.\n\nThe advice pleased the bailiff, and the head-man was quite willing to\ngo down the well.  When he was standing down below at the bottom,\nthey rolled down the largest mill-stone and thought they had broken\nhis skull, but he cried, chase away those hens from the well, they\nare scratching in the sand up there, and throwing the grains into my\neyes, so that I can't see.  So the bailiff cried, sh-sh, - and\npretended to frighten the hens away.  When the head-man had finished\nhis work, he climbed up and said, just look what a beautiful neck-tie\nI have on.  And behold it was the mill-stone which he was wearing\nround his neck.\n\nThe head-man now wanted to take his reward, but the bailiff again\nbegged for a fortnight's delay.  The clerks met together and advised\nhim to send the head-man to the haunted mill to grind corn by night,\nfor from thence as yet no man had ever returned in the morning alive.\n\nThe proposal pleased the bailiff, he called the head-man that very\nevening, and ordered him to take eight bushels of corn to the mill,\nand grind it that night, for it was wanted.  So the head-man went to\nthe loft, and put two bushels in his right pocket, and two in his\nleft, and took four in a wallet, half on his back, and half on his\nbreast, and thus laden went to the haunted mill.  The miller told him\nthat he could grind there very well by day, but not by night, for the\nmill was haunted, and that up to the present time whosoever had gone\ninto it at night had been found in the morning lying dead inside.  He\nsaid, I will manage it, just you go and put your head on the pillow.\n\nThen he went into the mill, and poured out the corn.  About eleven\no'clock he went into the miller's room, and sat down on the bench.\nWhen he had sat there a while, a door suddenly opened, and a large\ntable came in, and on the table, wine and roasted meats placed\nthemselves, and much good food besides, but everything came of\nitself, for no one was there to carry it.\n\nAfter this the chairs pushed themselves up, but no people came, until\nall at once he beheld fingers, which handled knives and forks, and\nlaid food on the plates, but with this exception he saw nothing.  As\nhe was hungry, and saw the food, he, too, place himself at the table,\nate with those who were eating and enjoyed it.  When he had had\nenough, and the others also had quite emptied their dishes, he\ndistinctly heard all the candles being suddenly snuffed out, and as\nit was now pitch dark, he felt something like a box on the ear.  Then\nhe said, if anything of that kind comes again, I shall strike out in\nreturn.  And when he had received a second box on the ear, he, too\nstruck out.\n\nAnd so it continued the whole night.  He took nothing without\nreturning it, but repaid everything with interest, and did not slay\nabout him in vain.  At daybreak, however, everything ceased.  When\nthe miller had got up, he wanted to look after him, and wondered if\nhe were still alive.  Then the youth said, I have given some in\nreturn.  The miller rejoiced, and said that the mill was now released\nfrom the spell, and wanted to give him much money as a reward.  But\nhe said, money, I will not have, I have enough of it.  So he took his\nmeal on his back, went home, and told the bailiff that he had done\nwhat he had been told to do, and would now have the reward agreed on.\n\nWhen the bailiff heard that, he was seriously alarmed and quite\nbeside himself.  He walked to and fro in the room, and drops of sweat\nran down from his forehead.  Then he opened the window to get some\nfresh air, but before he was aware, the head-man had given him such a\nkick that he flew through the window out into the air, and so far\naway that no one ever saw him again.\n\nThen said the head-man to the bailiff's wife, if he does not come\nback, you must take the other blow.  She cried, no, no I cannot bear\nit.  And opened the other window, because drops of sweat were running\ndown her forehead.  Then he gave her such a kick that she, too, flew\nout, and as she was lighter she went much higher than her husband.\nHer husband cried, do come to me, but she replied, come you to me, I\ncannot come to you.\n\nAnd they hovered about there in the air, and could not get to each\nother, and whether they are still hovering about or not, I do not\nknow, but the young giant took up his iron bar, and went on his way.\n", "The Elves": "There was once upon a time a rich king who had three daughters, who\ndaily went to walk in the palace garden, and the king was a great\nlover of all kinds of fine trees, but there was one for which he had\nsuch an affection, that if anyone gathered an apple from it he wished\nhim a hundred fathoms underground.  And when harvest time came, the\napples on this tree were all as red as blood.  The three daughters\nwent every day beneath the tree, and looked to see if the wind had\nnot blown down an apple, but they never by any chance found one, and\nthe tree was so loaded with them that it was almost breaking, and the\nbranches hung down to the ground.\n\nThen the king's youngest child had a great desire for an apple, and\nsaid to her sisters, our father loves us far too much to wish us\nunderground, it is my belief that he would only do that to people who\nwere strangers.  And while she was speaking, the child plucked off\nquite a large apple, and ran to her sisters, saying, just taste, my\ndear little sisters, for never in my life have I tasted anything so\ndelightful.  Then the two other sisters also ate some of the apple,\nwhereupon all three sank deep down into the earth, where they could\nhear no cock crow.\n\nWhen mid-day came, the king wished to call them to come to dinner,\nbut they were nowhere to be found.  He sought them everywhere in the\npalace and garden, but could not find them. Then he was much\ntroubled, and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his\ndaughters back again should have one of them to wife. Hereupon so\nmany young men went about the country in search, that there was no\ncounting them, for everyone loved the three children because they\nwere so kind to all, and so fair of face.\n\nThree young huntsmen also went out, and when they had traveled about\nfor eight days, they arrived at a great castle, in which were\nbeautiful apartments, and in one room a table was laid on which were\ndelicate dishes which were still so warm that they were smoking, but\nin the whole of the castle no human being was either to be seen or\nheard.  They waited there for half a day, and the food still remained\nwarm and smoking, and at length they were so hungry that they sat\ndown and ate, and agreed with each other that they would stay and\nlive in that castle, and that one of them, who should be chosen by\ncasting lots, should remain in the house, and the two others seek the\nking's daughters.\n\nThey cast lots, and the lot fell on the eldest, so next day the two\nyounger went out to seek, and the eldest had to stay home.  At\nmid-day came a small, small mannikin and begged for a piece of bread,\nthen the huntsman took the bread which he had found there, and cut a\nround off the loaf and was about to give it to him, but while he was\ngiving it to the mannikin, the latter let it fall, and asked the\nhuntsman to be so good as to give him that piece again.  The huntsman\nwas about to do so and stooped, on which the mannikin took a stick,\nseized him by the hair, and gave him a good beating.\n\nNext day, the second stayed at home, and he fared no better. When the\ntwo others returned in the evening, the eldest said, well, how have\nyou got on? Oh, very badly, said he, and then they lamented their\nmisfortune together, but they said nothing about it to the youngest,\nfor they did not like him at all, and always called him stupid Hans,\nbecause he did not know the ways of the world.\n\nOn the third day, the youngest stayed at home, and again the little\nmannikin came and begged for a piece of bread.  When the youth gave\nit to him, the elf let it fall as before, and asked him to be so good\nas to give him that piece again.  Then said Hans to the little\nmannikin, what, can you not pick up that piece yourself?  If you will\nnot take as much trouble as that for your daily bread, you do not\ndeserve to have it.  Then the mannikin grew very angry and said he\nwas to do it, but the huntsman would not, and took my dear mannikin,\nand gave him a thorough beating.  Then the mannikin screamed\nterribly, and cried, stop, stop, and let me go, and I will tell you\nwhere the king's daughters are. \n\nWhen Hans heard that, he left off beating him and the mannikin told\nhim that he was a gnome, and that there were more than a thousand\nlike him, and that if he would go with him he would show him where\nthe king's daughters were.  Then he showed him a deep well, but there\nwas no water in it.  And the elf said that he knew well that the\ncompanions Hans had with him did not intend to deal honorably with\nhim, therefore if he wished to deliver the king's children, he must\ndo it alone.\n\nThe two other brothers would also be very glad to recover the king's\ndaughters, but they did not want to have any trouble or danger.  Hans\nwas therefore to take a large basket, and he must seat himself in it\nwith his hunting knife and a bell, and be let down.  Below are three\nrooms, and in each of them was a princess, who was lousing a dragon\nwith many heads, which he must cut off.  And having said all this,\nthe elf vanished.\n\nWhen it was evening the two brothers came and asked how he had got\non, and he said, pretty well so far, and that he had seen no one\nexcept at mid-day when a little mannikin had come and begged for a\npiece of bread, that he had given some to him, but that the mannikin\nhad let it fall and had asked him to pick it up again, but as he did\nnot choose to do that, the elf had begun to scold, and that he had\nlost his temper, and had given the elf a beating, at which he had\ntold him where the king's daughters were. Then the two were so angry\nat this that they grew green and yellow.\n\nNext morning they went to the well together, and drew lots who should\nfirst seat himself in the basket, and again the lot fell on the\neldest, and he was to seat himself in it, and take the bell with him.\nThen he said, if I ring, you must draw me up again immediately.  When\nhe had gone down for a short distance, he rang, and they at once drew\nhim up again.  Then the second seated himself in the basket, but he\ndid just the same as the first, and then it was the turn of the\nyoungest, but he let himself be lowered quite to the bottom.\n\nWhen he had got out of the basket, he took his knife, and went and\nstood outside the first door and listened, and heard the dragon\nsnoring quite loudly.  He opened the door slowly, and one of the\nprincesses was sitting there, and had nine dragon's heads lying upon\nher lap, and was lousing them.  Then he took his knife and hewed at\nthem, and the nine fell off.  The princess sprang up, threw her arms\nround his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her\nstomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck.\n\nThen he went to the second princess, who had a dragon with five heads\nto louse, and delivered her also, and to the youngest, who had a\ndragon with four heads, he went likewise.  And they all rejoiced, and\nembraced him and kissed him without stopping.  Then he rang very\nloud, so that those above heard him, and he placed the princesses one\nafter the other in the basket, and had them all drawn up, but when it\ncame to his own turn he remembered the words of the elf, who had told\nhim that his comrades did not mean well by him.  So he took a great\nstone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it\nwas about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that\nthe basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that\nhe was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them\npromise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them.\nThen they went to the king, and each demanded a princess in marriage.\n\nIn the meantime the youngest huntsman was wandering about the three\nchambers in great trouble, fully expecting to have to end his days\nthere, when he saw, hanging on the wall, a flute, then said he, why\ndo you hang there.  No one can be merry here.\n\nHe looked at the dragons, heads likewise and said, you too cannot\nhelp me now.  He walked to and fro for such a long time that he made\nthe surface of the ground quite smooth.  But at last other thoughts\ncame to his mind, and he took the flute from the wall, and played a\nfew notes on it, and suddenly a number of elves appeared, and with\nevery note that he sounded one more came.  Then he played until the\nroom was entirely filled.\n\nThey all asked what he desired, so he said he wished to get above\nground back to daylight, on which they seized him by every hair that\ngrew on his head, and thus they flew with him onto the earth again.\nWhen he was above ground, he at once went to the king's palace, just\nas the wedding of one princess was about to be celebrated, and he\nwent to the room where the king and his three daughters were.  When\nthe princesses saw him they fainted.\n\nHereupon the king was angry, and ordered him to be put in prison at\nonce, because he thought he must have done some injury to the\nchildren.  When the princesses came to themselves, however, they\nentreated the king to set him free again.\n\nThe king asked why, and they said that they were not allowed to tell\nthat, but their father said that they were to tell it to the stove.\nAnd he went out, listened at the door, and heard everything.  Then he\ncaused the two brothers to be hanged on the gallows, and to the third\nhe gave his youngest daughter, and on that occasion I wore a pair of\nglass shoes, and I struck them against a stone, and they said, klink,\nand were broken.\n", "The Peasant's Wise Daughter": "There was once a poor peasant who had no land, but only a small\nhouse, and one daughter.  Then said the daughter, we ought to ask our\nlord the king for a bit of newly-cleared land.  When the king heard\nof their poverty, he presented them with a piece of land, which she\nand her father dug up, and intended to sow with a little corn and\ngrain of that kind.  When they had dug nearly the whole of the field,\nthey found in the earth a mortar made of pure gold.  Listen, said the\nfather to the girl, as our lord the king has been so gracious and\npresented us with the field, we ought to give him this mortar in\nreturn for it.  The daughter, however, would not consent to this, and\nsaid, father, if we have the mortar without having the pestle as\nwell, we shall have to get the pestle, so you had much better say\nnothing about it.  But he would not obey her, and took the mortar and\ncarried it to the king, said that he had found it in the cleared\nland, and asked if he would accept it as a present.  The king took\nthe mortar, and asked if he had found nothing besides that.  No,\nanswered the countryman.\n\nThen the king said that he must now bring him the pestle.  The\npeasant said they had not found that, but he might just as well have\nspoken to the wind, he was put in prison, and was to stay there until\nhe produced the pestle.  The servants had daily to carry him bread\nand water, which is what people get in prison, and they heard how the\nman cried out continually, ah, if I had but listened to my daughter.\nAlas, alas, if I had but listened to my daughter, and would neither\neat nor drink.  So he commanded the servants to bring the prisoner\nbefore him, and then the king asked the peasant why he was always\ncrying, ah, if I had but listened to my daughter, and what it was\nthat his daughter had said.  She told me that I ought not to take the\nmortar to you, for I should have to produce the pestle as well.  If\nyou have a daughter who is as wise as that, let her come here.\n\nShe was therefore obliged to appear before the king, who asked her if\nshe really was so wise, and said he would set her a riddle, and if\nshe could guess that, he would marry her.  She at once said yes, she\nwould guess it.  Then said the king, come to me not clothed, not\nnaked, not riding, not walking, not in the road, and not off the\nroad, and if you can do that I will marry you.\n\nSo she went away, put off everything she had on, and then she was not\nclothed, and took a great fishing net, and seated herself in it and\nwrapped it entirely round and round her, so that she was not naked,\nand she hired an ass, and tied the fisherman's net to its tail, so\nthat it was forced to drag her along, and that was neither riding nor\nwalking.  The ass had also to drag her in the ruts, so that she only\ntouched the ground with her big toe, and that was neither being in\nthe road nor off the road.  And when she arrived in that fashion, the\nking said she had guessed the riddle and fulfilled all the\nconditions.\n\nThen he ordered her father to be released from the prison, took her\nto wife, and gave into her care all the royal possessions. Now when\nsome years had passed, the king was once reviewing his troops on\nparade, when it happened that some peasants who had been selling wood\nstopped with their waggons before the palace, some of them had oxen\nyoked to them, and some horses. There was one peasant who had three\nhorses, one of which was delivered of a young foal, and it ran away\nand lay down between two oxen which were in front of the waggon.\nWhen the peasants came together, they began to dispute, to beat each\nother and make a disturbance, and the peasant with the oxen wanted to\nkeep the foal, and said one of the oxen had given birth to it, and\nthe other said his horse had had it, and that it was his.  The\nquarrel came before the king, and he give the verdict that the foal\nshould stay where it had been found, and so the peasant with the\noxen, to whom it did not belong, got it.\n\nThen the other went away, and wept and lamented over his foal.  Now\nhe had heard how gracious his lady the queen was because she herself\nhad sprung from poor peasant folks, so he went to her and begged her\nto see if she could not help him to get his foal back again.  Said\nshe, yes, I will tell you what to do, if you will promise me not to\nbetray me.\n\nEarly to-morrow morning, when the king parades the guard, place\nyourself there in the middle of the road by which he must pass, take\na great fishing-net and pretend to be fishing, go on fishing, and\nempty out the net as if you had got it full, and then she told him\nalso what he was to say if he was questioned by the king.  The next\nday, therefore, the peasant stood there, and fished on dry ground.\nWhen the king passed by, and saw that, he sent his messenger to ask\nwhat the stupid man was about.  He answered, I am fishing.  The\nmessenger asked how he could fish when there was no water there.  The\npeasant said, it is as easy for me to fish on dry land as it is for\nan ox to have a foal.\n\nThe messenger went back and took the answer to the king, who ordered\nthe peasant to be brought to him and told him that this was not his\nown idea, and he wanted to know whose it was.  The peasant, said the\nking, must confess this at once.  The peasant, however, would not do\nso, and said always, God forbid he should, the idea was his own.  So\nthey laid him on a heap of straw, and beat him and tormented him so\nlong that at last he admitted that he had got the idea from the\nqueen.\n\nWhen the king reached home again, he said to his wife, why have you\nbehaved so falsely to me.  I will not have you any longer for a wife,\nyour time is up, go back to the place from whence you came - to your\npeasant's hut.  One favor, however, he granted her, she might take\nwith her the one thing that was dearest and best in her eyes, and\nthus was she dismissed.\n\nShe said, yes, my dear husband, if you command this, I will do it,\nand she embraced him and kissed him, and said she would take leave of\nhim.  Then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught to be brought, to\ndrink farewell to him, the king took a long draught, but she took\nonly a little.  He soon fell into a deep sleep, and when she\nperceived that, she called a servant and took a fair white linen\ncloth and wrapped the king in it, and the servant was forced to carry\nhim into a carriage that stood before the door, and she drove with\nhim to her own little house.\n\nShe laid him in her own little bed, and he slept one day and one\nnight without awakening, and when he awoke he looked round and said,\ngood God, where am I.  He called his attendants, but none of them\nwere there.  At length his wife came to his bedside and said, my dear\nlord and king, you told me I might bring away with me from the palace\nthat which was dearest and most precious in my eyes - I have nothing\nmore precious and dear than yourself, so I have brought you with me.\n\nTears rose to the king's eyes and he said, dear wife, you shall be\nmine and I will be yours, and he took her back with him to the royal\npalace and was married again to her, and at the present time they are\nvery likely still living.\n", "The Three Little Birds": "About a thousand or more years ago, there were in this\ncountry nothing but small kings, and one of them who lived\non the Keuterberg was very fond of hunting.  Once on a time\nwhen he was riding forth from his castle with his huntsmen,\nthree girls were watching their cows upon the mountain, and\nwhen they saw the king with all his followers, the eldest girl\npointed to him, and called to the two other girls, hullo.  Hullo.\nIf I do not get that one, I will have none.  Then the second\ngirl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to\nthe one who was on the king's right hand, hullo.  Hullo.  If\nI do not get him, I will have no one.  These, however, were the\ntwo ministers.  The king heard all this, and when he had come\nback from the chase, he caused the three girls to be brought\nto him, and asked them what they had said yesterday on the\nmountain.  This they would not tell him, so the king asked\nthe eldest if she really would take him for her husband.  Then\nshe said, yes, and the two ministers married the two sisters,\nfor they were all three fair and beautiful of face, especially\nthe queen, who had hair like flax.\n\nBut the two sisters had no children, and once when the king was\nobliged to go from home he invited them to come to the queen\nin order to cheer her, for she was about to bear a child.  She\nhad a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world\nwith him.  Then the two sisters said to each other that they\nwould throw the beautiful boy into the water.  When they had\nthrown him in - I believe it was into the Weser - a little\nbird flew up into the air, which sang -\n          to thy death art thou sped\n          until God's word be said.\n          In the white lily bloom,\n          brave boy, is thy tomb.\n\nWhen the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and\nran away in great haste.  When the king came home they told him\nthat the queen had been delivered of a dog.  Then the king\nsaid, what God does, is well done.  But a fisherman who\ndwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while\nhe was still alive, and as his wife had no children, they reared\nhim.\n\nWhen a year had gone by, the king again went away, and\nthe queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters\nlikewise took and threw into the water.  Then up flew a little\nbird again and sang -\n          to thy death art thou sped\n          until God's word be said.\n          In the white lily bloom,\n          brave boy, is thy tomb.\n\nAnd when the king came back, they told him that the queen\nhad once more given birth to a dog, and he again said,\nwhat God does, is well done.  The fisherman, however, fished\nthis one also out of the water, and reared him.\n\nThen the king again journeyed forth, and the queen had a\nlittle girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the\nwater.  Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang -\n          to thy death art thou sped\n          until God's word be said.\n          In the white lily bloom,\n          bonny girl, is thy tomb.\n\nAnd when the king came home they told him that the queen had\nbeen delivered of a cat.  Then the king grew angry, and ordered\nhis wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up\nfor many long years.\n\nWhen the children had grown up, the eldest once went out with\nsome other boys to fish, but the other boys would not have\nhim with them, and said, go your way, foundling.\n\nHereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if\nthat was true.  The fisherman told him that once when he was\nfishing he had drawn him out of the water.  So the boy said he\nwould go forth and seek his father.  The fisherman, however,\nentreated him to stay, but he would not let himself be hindered,\nand at last the fisherman consented.  Then the boy went on his\nway and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great\nstretch of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing.\n\n\"Good day, mother,\" said the boy.\n\n\"Many thanks,\" said she.\n\n\"You will fish long enough before you catch anything.\"\n\n\"And you will seek long enough before you find your father.  How\nwill you get over the water,\" said the woman.\n\n\"God knows.\"\n\nThen the old woman took him up on her back and carried him\nthrough it, and he sought for a long time, but could not\nfind his father.\n\nWhen a year had gone by, the second boy set out to seek his\nbrother.  He came to the water, and all fared with him just\nas with his brother.  And now there was no one at home but the\ndaughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last\nshe also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she\nwished to go in search of her brothers.  Then she likewise came\nto the great stretch of water, and she said to the old woman,\n\"Good day, mother.\"\n\n\"Many thanks,\" replied the old woman.\n\n\"May God help you with your fishing,\" said the maiden.  When\nthe old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried\nher over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, \"Go, my\ndaughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a\ngreat black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without\neither laughing or looking at it.  Then you will come to a great\nhigh castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall,\nand go straight through the castle, and out again on the other\nside.  There you will see an old fountain out of which a large\ntree has grown, whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must\ntake down.  Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain,\nand with these two things go back by the same way.  Pick up\nthe wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and\nwhen you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it,\nbut be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me.\"\n\nThe maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and\non her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each\nother over half the world.  They went together to the place\nwhere the black dog was lying on the road, she struck it in\nthe face, and it turned into a handsome prince who went with\nthem to the river.  There the old woman was still standing.  She\nrejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the\nwater, and then she too went away, for now she was freed.  The\nothers, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that\nthey had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the\nwall.\n\nBut the second son could not settle at home, and took his\ncrossbow and went a-hunting.  When he was tired he took his\nflute, and made music.  The king was hunting too, and heard that\nand went thither, and when he met the youth, he said, \"Who has given\nyou leave to hunt here?\"\n\n\"Oh, no one.\"\n\n\"To whom do you belong, then?\"\n\n\"I am the fisherman's son.\"\n\n\"But he has no children.\"\n\n\"If you will not believe, come with me.\"\n\nThat the king did, and questioned the fisherman, who told\nhim everything, and the little bird on the wall began to\nsing -\n          the mother sits alone\n          there in the prison small,\n          o king of royal blood,\n          these are thy children all.\n          The sisters twain so false,\n          they wrought the children woe,\n          there in the waters deep\n          where the fishermen come and go.\n\nThen they were all terrified, and the king took the bird, the\nfisherman and the three children back with him to the castle,\nand ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife\nout again.  She had grown quite ill and weak, so the daughter\ngave her some of the water of the fountain to drink, and she\nbecame strong and healthy.  But the two false sisters were\nburnt, and the daughter married the prince.\n", "The Spirit in the Bottle": "There was once a poor woodcutter who toiled from early\nmorning till late at night.  When at last he had laid by some\nmoney he said to his boy, \"You are my only child, I will spend the\nmoney which I have earned with the sweat of my brow on your\neducation, if you learn some honest trade you can support me in\nmy old age, when my limbs have grown stiff and I am obliged to\nstay at home.\"\n\nThen the boy went to a high school and learned\ndiligently so that his masters praised him, and he remained\nthere a long time.  When he had worked through two classes, but\nwas still not yet perfect in everything, the little pittance\nwhich the father had earned was all spent, and the boy was\nobliged to return home to him.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the father, sorrowfully, \"I can\ngive you no more, and in these hard times I cannot earn a\nfarthing more than will suffice for our daily bread.\"  \"Dear\nfather,\" answered the son, \"don't trouble yourself about it, if it\nis God's will, it will turn to my advantage.  I shall soon\naccustom myself to it.\"  When the father wanted to go into the\nforest to earn money by helping to chop and stack wood, the\nson said, \"I will go with you and help you.\"  \"Nay, my son,\" said\nthe father, \"that would be hard for you.  You are not accustomed\nto rough work, and will not be able to bear it.  Besides, I have\nonly one axe and no money left wherewith to buy another.\"  \"Just\ngo to the neighbor,\" answered the son, \"he will lend you his axe\nuntil I have earned one for myself.\"\n\nThe father then borrowed an axe of the neighbor, and next\nmorning at break of day they went out into the forest together.\nThe son helped his father and was quite merry and brisk about\nit.  But when the sun was right over their heads, the father\nsaid, \"We will rest, and have our dinner, and then we shall work\ntwice as well.\"  The son took his bread in his hands, and said,\n\"Just you rest, father, I am not tired, I will walk up and down\na little in the forest, and look for birds' nests.\"  \"Oh, you fool,\"\nsaid the father, \"why should you want to run about there?  Afterwards\nyou will be tired, and no longer able to raise your arm.\nStay here, and sit down beside me.\"\n\nThe son, however, went into the forest, ate his bread, was very\nmerry and peered in among the green branches to see if he could\ndiscover a bird's nest anywhere.  So he walked to and fro until\nat last he came to a great dangerous-looking oak, which\ncertainly was already many hundred years old, and which five\nmen could not have spanned.  He stood still and looked at it, and\nthought, many a bird must have built its nest in that.  Then all at\nonce it seemed to him that he heard a voice.  He listened and\nbecame aware that someone was crying in a very smothered voice,\n\"Let me out, let me out.\"  He looked around, but could discover\nnothing.  Then he fancied that the voice came out of the ground.\nSo he cried, \"Where are you?\"  The voice answered, \"I am down here\namongst the roots of the oak-tree.  Let me out.  Let me out.\"\n\nThe schoolboy began to loosen the earth under the tree, and search\namong the roots, until at last he found a glass bottle in a little\nhollow.  He lifted it up and held it against the light, and then\nsaw a creature shaped like a frog, springing up and down in it.\n\"Let me out.  Let me out,\" it cried anew, and the boy thinking no\nevil, drew the cork out of the bottle.  Immediately a spirit\nascended from it, and began to grow, and grew so fast that in a\nvery few moments he stood before the boy, a terrible fellow as big\nas half the tree.  \"Do you know,\" he cried in an awful voice, \"what\nyour reward is for having let me out?\"  \"No,\" replied the boy\nfearlessly, \"how should I know that?\"  \"Then I will tell you,\" cried\nthe spirit, \"I must strangle you for it.\"  \"You should have told me\nthat sooner,\" said the boy, \"for I should then have left you shut\nup, but my head shall stand fast for all you can do, more persons\nthan one must be consulted about that.\"  \"More persons here, more\npersons there,\" said the spirit.  \"You shall have the reward you\nhave earned.  Do you think that I was shut up there for such a\nlong time as a favor.  No, it was a punishment for me.  I am the\nmighty Mercurius.  Whoso releases me, him must I strangle.\"\n\"Slowly,\" answered the boy, \"not so fast.  I must first know that\nyou really were shut up in that little bottle, and that you are\nthe right spirit.  If, indeed, you can get in again, I will believe\nand then you may do as you will with me.\"  The spirit said\nhaughtily, \"that is a very trifling feat.\"  Drew himself together,\nand made himself as small and slender as he had been at first, so\nthat he crept through the same opening, and right through the neck\nof the bottle in again.  Scarcely was he within than the boy\nthrust the cork he had drawn back into the bottle, and threw\nit among the roots of the oak into its old place, and the spirit\nwas deceived.\n\nAnd now the schoolboy was about to return to his father, but the\nspirit cried very piteously, \"Ah, do let me out, ah, do let me out.\"\n\"No,\" answered the boy, \"not a second time.  He who has once tried to\ntake my life shall not be set free by me, now that I have caught\nhim again.\"  \"If you will set me free,\" said the spirit, \"I will give\nyou so much that you will have plenty all the days of your life.\"\n\"No,\" answered the boy, \"you would cheat me as you did the first time.\"\n\"You are spurning you own good luck,\" said the spirit, \"I will do you\nno harm but will reward you richly.\"  The boy thought, \"I will\nventure it, perhaps he will keep his word, and anyhow he shall not\nget the better of me.\"\n\nThen he took out the cork, and the spirit\nrose up from the bottle as he had done before, stretched himself\nout and became as big as a giant.  \"Now you shall have your reward,\"\nsaid he, and handed the boy a little rag just like stiking-plaster,\nand said, \"If you spread one end of this over a wound it\nwill heal, and if you rub steel or iron with the other end it will\nbe changed into silver.\"  \"I must just try that,\" said the boy, and\nwent to a tree, tore off the bark with his axe, and rubbed it\nwith one end of the plaster.  It immediately closed together and\nwas healed.  \"Now, it is all right,\" he said to the spirit, \"and we\ncan part.\"  The spirit thanked him for his release, and the boy\nthanked the spirit for his present, and went back to his father.\n\n\"Where have you been racing about?\" said the father.  \"Why have you\nforgotten your work?  I always said that you would never come to\nanything.\"  \"Be easy, father, I will make it up.\"  \"Make it up indeed,\"\nsaid the father angrily, \"that's no use.\"  \"Take care, father, I will\nsoon hew that tree there, so that it will split.\"  Then he took\nhis plaster, rubbed the axe with it, and dealt a mighty blow, but\nas the iron had changed into silver, the edge bent.  \"Hi, father,\njust look what a bad axe you've given me, it has become quite\ncrooked.\"  The father was shocked and said, \"Ah, what have you done!\nNow I shall have to pay for that, and have not the wherewithal, and\nthat is all the good I have got by your\nwork.\"  \"Don't get angry,\" said the son, \"I will soon pay for the axe.\"\n\"Oh, you blockhead,\" cried the father, \"Wherewith will you pay for it?\nYou have nothing but what I give you.  These are students' tricks\nthat are sticking in your head, you have no idea of woodcutting.\"\n\nAfter a while the boy said, \"Father, I can really work no more, we\nhad better take a holiday.\"  \"Eh, what,\" answered he, \"do you think I\nwill sit with my hands lying in my lap like you.  I must go on\nworking, but you may take yourself off home.\"  \"Father, I am here in\nthis wood for the first time, I don't know my way alone.  Do go\nwith me.\"  As his anger had now abated, the father at last let\nhimself be persuaded and went home with him. Then he said to the\nson, \"Go and sell your damaged axe, and see what you can get for it,\nand I must earn the difference, in order to pay the neighbor.\"\n\nThe son took the axe, and carried it into town to a goldsmith,\nwho tested it, laid it in the scales, and said, \"It is worth four\nhundred talers, I have not so much as that by me.\"  The son said,\n\"Give me what thou have, I will lend you the rest.\"  The goldsmith\ngave him three hundred talers, and remained a hundred in his\ndebt.  The son thereupon went home and said, \"Father, I have got\nthe money, go and ask the neighbor what he wants for the axe.\"\n\"I know that already,\" answered the old man, \"one taler, six groschen.\"\n\"Then give him him two talers, twelve groschen, that is double and\nenough.  See, I have money in plenty.\"  And he gave the father\na hundred talers, and said, \"You shall never know want, live as\ncomfortably as you like.\"\n\n\"Good heavens,\" said the father, \"how\nhave you come by these riches?\"  The boy then told how all had come\nto pass, and how he, trusting in his luck, had made such a packet.\nBut with the money that was left, he went back to the high school\nand went on learning more, and as he could heal all wounds with\nhis plaster, he became the most famous doctor in the whole world.\n", "The Devil's Sooty Brother": "A discharged soldier had nothing to live on, and did not know how to\nmake his way.  So he went out into the forest and when he had walked\nfor a short time, he met a little man who turned out to be the devil.\nThe little man said to him, \"What ails you, you seem so very\nsorrowful?\" Then the soldier said, \"I am hungry, but have no money.\"\nThe devil said, \"If you will hire yourself to me, and be my\nserving-man, you shall have enough for all your life.  You shall\nserve me for seven years, and after that you shall again be free. But\none thing I must tell you, and that is, you must not wash, comb, or\ntrim yourself, or cut your hair or nails, or wipe the water from your\neyes.\" The soldier said, \"All right, if there is no help for it,\" and\nwent off with the little man, who straightway led him down into hell.\nThen he told him what he had to do.  He was to poke the fire under\nthe kettles wherein the hell-broth was stewing, keep the house clean,\ndrive all the sweepings behind the doors, and see that everything was\nin order, but if he once peeped into the kettles, it would go ill\nwith him.  The soldier said, \"Good, I will take care.\" And then the\nold devil went out again on his wanderings, and the soldier entered\nupon his new duties, made the fire, and swept the dirt well behind\nthe doors, just as he had been bidden.\n\nWhen the old devil came back again, he looked to see if all had been\ndone, appeared satisfied, and went forth a second time.  The soldier\nnow took a good look on every side, the kettles were standing all\nround hell with a mighty fire below them, and inside they were\nboiling and sputtering.  He would have given anything to look inside\nthem, if the devil had not so particularly forbidden him.\n\nAt last he could no longer restrain himself, slightly raised the lid\nof the first kettle, and peeped in, and there he saw his former\ncorporal sitting. \"Aha, old bird,\" said he, \"do I meet you here?  You\nonce had me in your power, now I have you.\" And he quickly let the\nlid fall, poked the fire, and added a fresh log.  After that, he went\nto the second kettle, raised its lid also a little, and peeped in and\nthere sat his former ensign.  \"Aha, old bird, so I find you here, you\nonce had me in your power, now I have you.\" He closed the lid again,\nand fetched yet another log to make it really hot.  Then he wanted to\nsee who might be sitting up in the third kettle - and who should it\nbe but his general.  \"Aha, old bird, do I meet you here.  Once you\nhad me in your power, now I have you.\" And he fetched the bellows and\nmade hell-fire blaze right under him.\n\nSo he did his work seven years in hell, did not wash, comb, or trim\nhimself, or cut his hair or nails, or wash the water out of his eyes,\nand the seven years seemed so short to him that he thought he had\nonly been half a year.  Now when the time had fully gone by, the\ndevil came and said, \"Well Hans, what have you done?\" \"I poked the\nfire under the kettles, and I have swept all the dirt well behind the\ndoors.\"\n\n\"But you have peeped into the kettles as well, it is lucky for you\nthat you added fresh logs to them, or else your life would have been\nforfeited.  Now that your time is up, will you go home again?\" \"Yes,\"\nsaid the soldier, \"I should very much like to see what my father is\ndoing at home.\" The devil said, \"In order that you may receive the\nwages you have earned, go and fill your knapsack full of the\nsweepings, and take it home with you.  You must also go unwashed and\nuncombed, with long hair on your head and beard, and with uncut nails\nand dim eyes, and when you are asked whence you come, you must say,\nfrom hell, and when you are asked who you are, you are to say, the\ndevil's sooty brother, and my king as well.\"\n\nThe soldier held his peace, and did as the devil bade him, but he was\nnot at all satisfied with his wages. Then as soon as he was up in the\nforest again, he took his knapsack from his back, to empty it, but on\nopening it, the sweepings had become pure gold.  \"I should never have\nexpected that,\" said he, and was well pleased, and entered the town.\nThe landlord was standing in front of the inn, and when he saw the\nsoldier approaching, he was terrified, because Hans looked such a\nhorrible sight, worse than a scare-crow.  He called to him and asked,\n\"Whence do you come?\" \"From hell.\" \"Who are you?\" \"The devil's sooty\nbrother, and my king as well.\" Then the host would not let him enter,\nbut when Hans showed him the gold, he came and unlatched the door\nhimself.  Hans then ordered the best room and attendance, ate, and\ndrank his fill, but neither washed nor combed himself as the devil\nhad bidden him, and at last lay down to sleep.  But the knapsack full\nof gold remained before the eyes of the landlord, and left him no\npeace, and during the night he crept in and stole it away.  Next\nmorning, however, when Hans got up and wanted to pay the landlord and\ntravel further, behold his knapsack was gone.  But he soon composed\nhimself and thought, you have been unfortunate from no fault of your\nown.  And straightway went back again to hell, complained of his\nmisfortune to the old devil, and begged for his help.  The devil\nsaid, \"Seat yourself, I will wash, comb, and trim you, cut your hair\nand nails, and wash your eyes for you.\" And when he had done with\nhim, he gave him the knapsack back again full of sweepings, and said,\n\"Go and tell the landlord that he must return you your money, or else\nI will come and fetch him, and he shall poke the fire in your place.\"\nHans went up and said to the landlord, \"You have stolen my money, if\nyou do not return it, you shall go down to hell in my place, and will\nlook as horrible as I.\" Then the landlord gave him the money, and\nmore besides, only begging him to keep it secret.  And Hans was now a\nrich man.\n\nHe set out on his way home to his father, bought himself a shabby\nsmock to wear, and strolled about making music, for he had learned to\ndo that while he was with the devil in hell.\n\nThere was however, an old king in that country, before whom he had to\nplay, and the king was so delighted with his playing, that he\npromised him his eldest daughter in marriage.  But when she heard\nthat she was to be married to a common fellow in a smock, she said,\n\"Rather than do that, I would go into the deepest water.\" Then the\nking gave him the youngest, who was quite willing to do it to please\nher father, and thus the devil's sooty brother got the king's\ndaughter, and when the aged king died, the whole kingdom likewise.\n\n", "Bearskin": "There was once a young fellow who enlisted as a soldier, conducted\nhimself bravely, and was always the foremost when it rained bullets.\nSo long as the war lasted, all went well, but when peace was made, he\nreceived his dismissal, and the captain said he might go where he\nliked.  His parents were dead, and he had no longer a home, so he\nwent to his brothers and begged them to take him in, and keep him\nuntil war broke out again.  The brothers, however, were hard-hearted\nand said, \"What can we do with you?  You are of no use to us, go and\nmake a living for yourself.\" The soldier had nothing left but his\ngun, so he took that on his shoulder, and went forth into the world.\n\nHe came to a wide heath, on which nothing was to be seen but a circle\nof trees, under these he sat sorrowfully down, and began to think\nover his fate.  I have no money, thought he, I have learnt no trade\nbut that of fighting, and now that they have made peace they don't\nwant me any longer, so I see before hand that I shall have to starve.\nAll at once he heard a rustling and when he looked round, a strange\nman stood before him, who wore a green coat and looked right stately,\nbut had a hideous cloven foot.  \"I know already what you are in need\nof,\" said the man, \"gold and possessions shall you have, as much as\nyou can make away with, do what you will, but first I must know if\nyou are fearless, that I may not bestow my money in vain.\" \"A soldier\nand fear - how can those two things go together?\" he answered, \"You\ncan put me to the proof.\" \"Very well, then,\" answered the man, \"look\nbehind you.\" The soldier turned round, and saw a large bear, which\ncame growling towards him.  \"Oho,\" cried the soldier, \"I will tickle\nyour nose for you, so that you shall soon lose your fancy for\ngrowling,\" and he aimed at the bear and shot it through the muzzle,\nit fell down and never stirred again.  \"I see quite well,\" said the\nstranger, \"that you are not wanting in courage, but there is still\nanother condition which you will have to fulfil.\" \"If it does not\nendanger my salvation,\" replied the soldier, who knew very well who\nwas standing by him.  \"If it does, I'll have nothing to do with it.\"\n\"You will look to that for yourself,\" answered greencoat, \"you shall\nfor the next seven years neither wash yourself, nor comb your beard,\nnor your hair, nor cut your nails, nor once say the Lord's prayer.  I\nwill give you a coat and a cloak, which during this time you must\nwear.  If you die during these seven years, you are mine, if you\nremain alive, you are free, and rich to boot, for all the rest of\nyour life.\" The soldier thought of the great extremity in which he\nnow found himself, and as he so often had gone to meet death, he\nresolved to risk it now also, and agreed to the terms.  The devil\ntook off his green coat, and gave it to the soldier, and said, \"If\nyou have this coat on your back and put your hand into the pocket,\nyou will always find it full of money.\" Then he pulled the skin off\nthe bear and said, \"This shall be your cloak, and your bed also, for\nthereon shall you sleep, and and in no other bed shall you lie, and\nbecause of this apparel shall you be called Bearskin.\" Whereupon the\ndevil vanished.\n\nThe soldier put the coat on, felt at once in the pocket, and found\nthat the thing was really true.  Then he put on the bearskin and went\nforth into the world, and enjoyed himself, refraining from nothing\nthat did him good and his money harm.\n\nDuring the first year his appearance was passable, but during the\nsecond he began to look like a monster.  His hair covered nearly the\nwhole of his face, his beard was like a piece of coarse felt, his\nfingers had claws, and his face was so covered with dirt that if\ncress had been sown on it, it would have come up.  Whosoever saw him,\nran away, but as he everywhere gave the poor money to pray that he\nmight not die during the seven years, and as he paid well for\neverything he still always found shelter.\n\nIn the fourth year, he entered an inn where the landlord would not\nreceive him, and would not even let him have a place in the stable,\nbecause he was afraid the horses would be scared.  But as Bearskin\nthrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out a handful of ducats,\nthe host let himself be persuaded and gave him a room in an outhouse.\nBearskin, however, was obliged to promise not to let himself be seen,\nlest the inn should get a bad name.\n\nAs Bearskin was sitting alone in the evening, and wishing from the\nbottom of his heart that the seven years were over, he heard a loud\nlamenting in a neighboring room.  He had a compassionate heart, so he\nopened the door, and saw an old man weeping bitterly, and wringing\nhis hands.  Bearskin went nearer, but the man sprang to his feet and\ntried to escape from him. At last when the man perceived that\nBearskin's voice was human he let himself be prevailed upon, and by\nkind words bearskin succeeded so far that the old man revealed the\ncause of his grief. His property had dwindled away by degrees, he and\nhis daughters would have to starve, and he was so poor that he could\nnot pay the innkeeper, and was to be put in prison.  \"If that is your\nonly trouble,\" said Bearskin, \"I have plenty of money.\" He caused the\ninnkeeper to be brought thither, paid him and even put a purse full\nof gold into the poor old man's pocket.\n\nWhen the old man saw himself set free from all his troubles he did\nnot know how to show his gratitude.  \"Come with me,\" said he to\nBearskin, \"my daughters are all miracles of beauty, choose one of\nthem for yourself as a wife.  When she hears what you have done for\nme, she will not refuse you.  You do in truth look a little strange,\nbut she will soon put you to rights again.\" This pleased Bearskin\nwell, and he went.  When the eldest saw him she was so terribly\nalarmed at his face that she screamed and ran away.  The second stood\nstill and looked at him from head to foot, but then she said, \"How\ncan I accept a husband who no longer has a human form?  The shaven\nbear that once was here and passed itself off for a man pleased me\nfar better, for at any rate it wore a hussar's dress and white\ngloves.  If he were only ugly, I might get used to that.\" The\nyoungest, however, said, \"Dear father, that must be a good man to\nhave helped you out of your trouble, so if you have promised him a\nbride for doing it, your promise must be kept.\" It was a pity that\nBearskin's face was covered with dirt and with hair, for if not they\nmight have seen how delighted he was when he heard these words.  He\ntook a ring from his finger, broke it in two, and gave her one half,\nthe other he kept for himself.  Then he wrote his name on her half,\nand hers on his, and begged her to keep her piece carefully. Then he\ntook his leave and said, \"I must still wander about for three years,\nand if I do not return then, you are free, for I shall be dead.  But\npray to God to preserve my life.\"\n\nThe poor betrothed bride dressed herself entirely in black, and when\nshe thought of her future bridegroom, tears came into her eyes.\nNothing but contempt and mockery fell to her lot from her sisters.\n\"Take care,\" said the eldest, \"if you give him your hand, he will\nstrike his claws into it.\" \"Beware,\" said the second.  \"Bears like\nsweet things, and if he takes a fancy to you, he will eat you up.\"\n\"You must always do as he likes,\" began the elder again, or else he\nwill growl.\" And the second continued, \"But the wedding will be a\nmerry one, for bears dance well.\" The bride was silent, and did not\nlet them vex her.  Bearskin, however, traveled about the world from\none place to another, did good where he was able, and gave generously\nto the poor that they might pray for him.\n\nAt length, as the last day of the seven years dawned, he went once\nmore out on to the heath, and seated himself beneath the circle of\ntrees.  It was not long before the wind whistled, and the devil stood\nbefore him and looked angrily at him, then he threw bearskin his\ncoat, and asked for his own green one back. \"We have not got so far\nas that yet,\" answered Bearskin, \"you must first make me clean.\"\nWhether the devil liked it or not, he was forced to fetch water, and\nwash Bearskin, comb his hair, and cut his nails.  After this, he\nlooked like a brave soldier, and was much handsomer than he had ever\nbeen before.\n\nWhen the devil had gone away, Bearskin was quite lighthearted. He\nwent into the town, put on a magnificent velvet coat, seated himself\nin a carriage drawn by four white horses, and drove to his bride's\nhouse.  No one recognized him.  The father took him for a\ndistinguished general, and led him into the room where his daughters\nwere sitting.  He was forced to place himself between the two eldest,\nwho helped him to wine, gave him the best pieces of meat, and thought\nthat in all the world they had never seen a handsomer man.  The\nbride, however, sat opposite to him in her black dress, and never\nraised her eyes, nor spoke a word.  When at length he asked the\nfather if he would give him one of his daughters to wife, the two\neldest jumped up, ran into their bedrooms to put on splendid dresses,\nfor each of them fancied she was the chosen one.\n\nThe stranger, as soon as he was alone with his bride, brought out his\nhalf of the ring, and threw it in a glass of wine which he handed\nacross the table to her.  She took the wine, but when she had drunk\nit, and found the half ring lying at the bottom, her heart began to\nbeat.  She got the other half, which she wore on a ribbon round her\nneck, joined them, and saw that the two pieces fitted exactly\ntogether.  Then said he, \"I am your betrothed bridegroom, whom you\nsaw as Bearskin, but through God's grace I have again received my\nhuman form, and have once more become clean.\" He went up to her,\nembraced her, and gave her a kiss.  In the meantime the two sisters\ncame back in full dress, and when they saw that the handsome man had\nfallen to the share of the youngest, and heard that he was Bearskin,\nthey ran out full of anger and rage.  One of them drowned herself in\nthe well, the other hanged herself on a tree.  In the evening, some\none knocked at the door, and when the bridegroom opened it, it was\nthe devil in his green coat, who said, \"You see, I have now got two\nsouls in the place of your one.\"\n", "Sweet Porridge": "There was a poor but good little girl who lived alone with her\nmother, and they no longer had anything to eat.  So the child went\ninto the forest, and there an aged woman met her who was aware of her\nsorrow, and presented her with a little pot, which when she said,\ncook, little pot, cook, would cook good, sweet porridge, and when she\nsaid, stop, little pot, it ceased to cook.  The girl took the pot\nhome to her mother, and now they were freed from their poverty and\nhunger, and ate sweet porridge as often as they chose.  Once on a\ntime when the girl had gone out, her mother said, cook, little pot,\ncook.  And it did cook and she ate till she was satisfied, and then\nshe wanted the pot to stop cooking, but did not know the word.  So it\nwent on cooking and the porridge rose over the edge, and still it\ncooked on until the kitchen and whole house were full, and then the\nnext house, and then the whole street, just as if it wanted to\nsatisfy the hunger of the whole world, and there was the greatest\ndistress, but no one knew how to stop it.  At last when only one\nsingle house remained, the child came home and just said, stop,\nlittle pot, and it stopped and gave up cooking, and whosoever wished\nto return to the town had to eat his way back.\n", "Wise Folks": "One day a peasant took his good hazel-stick out of the corner\nand said to his wife, trina, I am going across country, and\nshall not return for three days.  If during that time the\ncattle-dealer should happen to call and want to buy our three\ncows, you may strike a bargain at once, but not unless you can\nget two hundred talers for them, nothing less, do you hear.  For\nheaven's sake, just go in peace, answered the woman, I will\nmanage that.  You, indeed, said the man.  You once fell on your\nhead when you were a little child, and that affects you even now,\nbut let me tell you this, if you do anything foolish, I will\nmake your back black and blue, and not with paint, I assure\nyou, but with the stick which I have in my hand, and the coloring\nshall last a whole year, you may rely on that.  And having said\nthat, the man went on his way.\n\nNext morning the cattle-dealer came, and the woman had no\nneed to say many words to him.  When he had seen the cows and heard\nthe price, he said, I am quite willing to give that.  Honestly\nspeaking, they are worth it.  I will take the beasts away with\nme at once.  He unfastened their chains and drove them out of\nthe byre, but just as he was going out of the yard-door, the\nwoman clutched him by the sleeve and said, you must give me the\ntwo hundred talers now, or I cannot let the cows go.  True, answered the man,\nbut I have forgotten to buckle on my money-belt.  Have no fear,\nhowever, you shall have security for my paying.  I will take two\ncows with me and leave one, and then you will have a good pledge.\n\nThe woman saw the force of this, and let the man go away\nwith the cows, and thought to herself, how pleased Hans will be\nwhen he finds how cleverly I have managed it.  The peasant came\nhome on the third day as he had said he would, and at once inquired\nif the cows were sold.  Yes, indeed, dear Hans, answered the\nwoman, and as you said, for two hundred talers.  They are scarcely\nworth so much, but the man took them without making any objection.\nWhere is the money, asked the peasant.  Oh, I have not got the\nmoney, replied the woman, he had happened to forget his money-belt,\nbut he will soon bring it, and he left good security behind him.\nWhat kind of security, asked the man.  One of the three cows, which\nhe shall not have until he has paid for the other two.  I have\nmanaged very cunningly, for I have kept the smallest, which eats\nthe least.  The man was enraged and lifted up his stick, and was\njust going to give her the beating he had promised her, when\nsuddenly he let the stick fail and said, you\nare the stupidest goose that ever waddled on God's earth, but\nI am sorry for you.  I will go out into the highways and wait for\nthree days to see if I find anyone who is still stupider than you.\nIf I succeed in doing so, you shall go scot-free, but if I do not\nfind him, you shall receive your well-deserved reward without any\ndiscount.\n\nHe went out into the great highways, sat down on a stone, and\nwaited for what would happen.  Then he saw a peasant's waggon\ncoming towards him, and a woman was standing upright in the\nmiddle of it, instead of sitting on the bundle of straw which\nwas lying beside her, or walking near the oxen and leading them.\n\nThe man thought to himself, that is certainly one of the kind I\nam in search of, and jumped up and ran backwards and forwards in\nfront of the waggon like one who is not in his right mind.  What\ndo you want, my friend, said the woman to him.  I don't know you,\nwhere do you come from.  I have fallen down from heaven, replied\nthe man, and don't know how to get back again, couldn't you drive\nme up.  No, said the woman, I don't know the way, but if you come\nfrom heaven you can surely tell me how my husband is, who has been\nthere these three years.  You must have seen him.  Oh, yes, I\nhave seen him, but all men can't get on well.  He keeps sheep,\nand the sheep give him a great deal to do.  They run up the\nmountains and lose their way in the wilderness, and he has to run\nafter them and drive them together again.  His clothes are\nall torn to pieces too, and will soon fall off his body.  There is\nno tailor there, for saint peter won't let any of them in, as you\nknow by the story.  Who would have thought it, cried the woman, I\ntell you what, I will fetch his sunday coat which is still hanging\nat home in the cupboard.  He can wear that and look respectable.\nYou will be so kind as to take it with you.  That won't do very\nwell, answered the peasant, people are not allowed to take clothes\ninto heaven, they are taken away at the gate.  Then listen, said\nthe woman, I sold my fine wheat yesterday and got a good lot of\nmoney for it, I will send that to him.  If you hide the purse in\nyour pocket, no one will know that you have it.  If you can't\nmanage it any other way, said the peasant, I will do you that\nfavor.  Just\nsit still where you are, said she, and I will drive home and fetch\nthe purse, I shall soon be back again.  I do not sit down on the\nbundle of straw, but stand up in the waggon, because it makes it\nlighter for the cattle.\n\nShe drove her oxen away, and the peasant\nthought, that woman has a perfect talent for folly, if she really\nbrings the money, my wife may think herself fortunate, for she\nwill get no beating.  It was not long before she came in a great\nhurry with the money, and with her own hands put it in his pocket.\nBefore she went away, she thanked him again a thousand times for\nhis courtesy.\n\nWhen the woman got home again, she found her son who had come in\nfrom the field.  She told him what unexpected things had befallen\nher, and then added, I am truly delighted at having found an\nopportunity of sending something to my poor husband.  Who would\never have imagined that he could be suffering for want of anything\nup in heaven.  The son was full of astonishment.  Mother, said he,\nit is not every day that a man comes from heaven in this way, I\nwill go out immediately, and see if he is still to be found, he\nmust tell me what it is like up there, and how the work is done.\n\nHe saddled the horse and rode off with all speed.  He found the\npeasant who was sitting under a willow-tree, and was about to\ncount the money in the purse.  Have you seen the man who has\nfallen down from heaven, cried the youth to him.  Yes, answered the\npeasant, he has set out on his way back there, and has gone up\nthat hill, from whence it will be rather nearer, you could still\ncatch him up, if you were to ride fast.  Alas, said the youth, I\nhave been doing tiring work all day, and the ride here has\ncompletely worn me out, you know the man, be so kind as to get on\nmy horse, and go and persuade him to come here.  Aha, thought the\npeasant, here is another who has not a brain in his head.  Why\nshould I not do you this favor, said he, and mounted the horse and\nrode off at a quick trot.  The youth remained sitting there till\nnight fell, but the peasant never came back.  The man from heaven\nmust certainly have been in a great hurry, and would not turn back,\nthought he, and the peasant has no doubt given\nhim the horse to take to my father.  He went home and told his\nmother what had happened, and that he had sent his father the\nhorse so that he might not have to be always running about.  You\nhave done well, answered she, your legs are younger than his, and\nyou can go on foot.\n\nWhen the peasant got home, he put the horse in the stable beside\nthe cow which he had as a pledge, and then went to his wife and\nsaid, trina, as your luck would have it, I have found two who\nare still sillier fools than you, this time you escape without\na beating.  I will store it up for another occasion.  Then he\nlighted his pipe, sat down in his grandfather's chair, and said,\nit was a good stroke of business to get a sleek horse and a great\npurse full of money into the bargain, for two lean cows.  If\nstupidity always brought in as much as that, I would be quite\nwilling to hold it in honor.  So thought the peasant, but you\nno doubt prefer simpletons.\n", "Stories About Snakes": "There was once a little child whose mother gave her every\nafternoon a small bowl of milk and bread, and the child seated\nherself in the yard with it.  But when she began to eat,\na paddock came creeping out of a crevice in the wall, dipped its\nlittle head in the dish, and ate with her.  The child took pleasure\nin this, and when she was sitting there with her little dish and\nthe paddock did not come at once, she cried,\n               paddock, paddock, come swiftly\n               hither come, thou tiny thing,\n               thou shalt have thy crumbs of bread,\n               thou shalt refresh thyself with milk.\n\nThen the paddock came in haste, and enjoyed its food.  It even\nshowed gratitude, for it brought the child all kinds of pretty\nthings from its hidden treasures, bright stones, pearls, and golden\nplaythings.  The paddock, however, drank only the milk, and left\nthe bread-crumbs alone.  Then one day the child took its little\nspoon and struck the paddock gently on its head, and said, eat the\nbread-crumbs as well, little thing.  The mother, who was standing\nin the kitchen, heard the child talking to someone, and when she\nsaw that she was striking a paddock with her spoon, ran out with\na log of wood, and killed the good little creature.\n\nFrom that time forth, a change came over the child.  As long as\nthe paddock had eaten with her, she had grown tall and strong, but\nnow she lost her pretty rosy cheeks and wasted away.  It was not\nlong before the funeral bird began to cry in the night, and the\nredbreast to collect little branches and leaves for a funeral\nwreath and soon afterwards the child lay on her bier.\n\n                         II\nAn orphan child was sitting by the town walls spinning, when she\nsaw a paddock coming out of a hole low down in the wall.  Swiftly\nshe spread out beside it one of the blue silk handkerchiefs for\nwhich paddocks have such a strong liking, and which are the only\nthings they will creep on.  As soon as the paddock saw it, it\nwent back, then returned, bringing with it a small golden crown,\nlaid it on the handkerchief, and then went away again.  The girl took\nup the crown, which glittered and was of delicate golden filagree\nwork.  It was not long before the paddock came back for the second\ntime, but when it did not see the crown any more, it crept up\nto the wall, and in its grief smote its little head against it\nas long as it had strength to do so, until at last it lay there\ndead.  If the girl had but left the crown where it was, the paddock\nwould certainly have brought still more of its treasures out of\nthe hole.\n\n                         III\nThe paddock cries, huhu, huhu.  The child says, come out.  The\npaddock comes out, whereupon the child inquires about her little\nsister, have you not seen little red-stockings.  The paddock says,\nno, I have not.  Have you.  Huhu, huhu, huhu.\n", "The Poor Miller's Boy and the Cat": "In a certain mill lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child,\nand three apprentices served under him.  As they had been with him\nseveral years, he one day said to them, \"I am old, and want to sit\nbehind the stove.  Go out, and whichsoever of you brings me the best\nhorse home, to him will I give the mill, and in return for it he\nshall take care of me till my death.\"\n\nThe third of the boys, however, was the dunce, who was looked on as\nfoolish by the others, they begrudged the mill to him, and afterwards\nhe would not even have it.  Then all three went out together, and\nwhen they came to the village, the two said to stupid Hans, \"You may\njust as well stay here, as long as you live you will never get a\nhorse.\" Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they\ncame to a cave in which they lay down to sleep.  The two smart ones\nwaited until Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away\nleaving him where he was.  And they thought they had done a very\nclever thing, but it was certain to turn out ill for them.\n\nWhen the sun rose, and Hans woke up, he was lying in a deep cavern.\nHe looked around on every side and exclaimed, \"Oh, heavens, where am\nI?\" Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, went into the\nforest, and thought, \"Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I\nobtain a horse now?\" Whilst he was thus walking full of thought, he\nmet a small tabby-cat which said quite kindly, \"Hans, where are you\ngoing?\" \"Alas, you can not help me.\" \"I well know your desire,\" said\nthe cat.  \"You wish to have a beautiful horse.  Come with me, and be\nmy faithful servant for seven years long, and then I will give you\none more beautiful than any you have ever seen in your whole life.\"\n\"Well, this is a strange cat,\" thought Hans, \"But I am determined to\nsee if she is telling the truth.\"\n\nSo she took him with her into her enchanted castle, where there were\nnothing but kittens who were her servants.  They leapt nimbly\nupstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy.  In the evening\nwhen they sat down to dinner, three of them had to make music.  One\nplayed the bass viol, the other the fiddle, and the third put the\ntrumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly\ncould.  When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the cat\nsaid, \"Now, Hans, come and dance with me.\" \"No,\" said he, \"I won't\ndance with a pussy cat.  I have never done that yet.\" \"Then take him\nto bed,\" said she to the cats.  So one of them lighted him to his\nbed-room, one pulled his shoes off, one his stockings, and at last\none of them blew out the candle.  Next morning they returned and\nhelped him out of bed, one put his stockings on for him, one tied his\ngarters, one brought his shoes, one washed him, and one dried his\nface with her tail.  \"That feels very soft,\" said Hans.\n\nHe, however, had to serve the cat, and chop some wood every day, and\nto do that, he had an axe of silver, and the wedge and saw were of\nsilver and the mallet of copper.  So he chopped the wood small,\nstayed there in the house and had good meat and drink, but never saw\nanyone but the tabby-cat and her servants.  Once she said to him, \"Go\nand mow my meadow, and dry the grass,\" and gave him a scythe of\nsilver, and a whetstone of gold, but bade him deliver them up again\ncarefully.  So Hans went thither, and did what he was bidden, and\nwhen he had finished the work, he carried the scythe, whetstone, and\nhay to the house, and asked if it was not yet time for her to give\nhim his reward.  \"No,\" said the cat, \"you must first do something\nmore for me of the same kind.  There is timber of silver, carpenter's\naxe, square, and everything that is needful, all of silver - with\nthese build me a small house.\" Then Hans built the small house, and\nsaid that he had now done everything, and still he had no horse.\n\nNevertheless the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six\nmonths.  The cat asked him if he would like to see her horses. \"Yes,\"\nsaid Hans.  Then she opened the door of the small house, and when she\nhad opened it, there stood twelve horses, - such horses, so bright\nand shining, that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them.  And now\nshe gave him to eat and drink, and said, \"Go home, I will not give\nyou your horse now, but in three days, time I will follow you and\nbring it.\" So Hans set out, and she showed him the way to the mill.\n\nShe, however, had never once given him a new coat, and he had been\nobliged to keep on his dirty old smock, which he had brought with\nhim, and which during the seven years had everywhere become too small\nfor him.  When he reached home, the two other apprentices were there\nagain as well, and each of them certainly had brought a horse with\nhim, but one of them was a blind one, and the other lame.  They asked\nHans where his horse was.  \"It will follow me in three days, time.\"\nThen they laughed and said, \"Indeed, stupid Hans, where will you get\na horse?\" \"It will be a fine one.\" Hans went into the parlor, but the\nmiller said he should not sit down to table, for he was so ragged and\ntorn, that they would all be ashamed of him if any one came in.  So\nthey gave him a mouthful of food outside, and at night, when they\nwent to rest, the two others would not let him have a bed, and at\nlast he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie down on a\nlittle hard straw.\n\nIn the morning when he awoke, the three days had passed, and a coach\ncame with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful\nto see them - and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for\nthe poor miller's boy.  And a magnificent princess alighted from the\ncoach and went into the mill, and this princess was the little\ntabby-cat whom poor Hans had served for seven years.  She asked the\nmiller where the miller's boy and dunce was.  Then the miller said,\n\"We cannot have him here in the mill, for he is so ragged, he is\nlying in the goose-house.\" Then the king's daughter said that they\nwere to bring him immediately.  So they brought him out, and he had\nto hold his little smock together to cover himself.  The servants\nunpacked splendid garments, and washed him and dressed him, and when\nthat was done, no king could have looked more handsome.  Then the\nmaiden desired to see the horses which the other apprentices had\nbrought home with them, and one of them was blind and the other lame.\nSo she ordered the servant to bring the seventh horse, and when the\nmiller saw it, he said that such a horse as that had never yet\nentered his yard. \"And that is for the third miller's boy,\" said she.\n\"Then he must have the mill,\" said the miller, but the king's\ndaughter said that the horse was there, and that he was to keep his\nmill as well, and took her faithful Hans and set him in the coach,\nand drove away with him.\n\nThey first drove to the little house which he had built with the\nsilver tools, and behold it was a great castle, and everything inside\nit was of silver and gold, and then she married him, and he was rich,\nso rich that he had enough for all the rest of his life.  After this,\nlet no one ever say that anyone who is silly can never become a\nperson of importance.\n", "The Two Travellers": "Hill and vale do not meet, but the children of men do, good and bad.\nIn this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met on their travels.  The\ntailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full of\nenjoyment.  He saw the shoemaker coming towards him from the other\nside, and as he observed by his bag what kind of a trade he plied, he\nsang a little mocking song to him,\n     sew me the seam,\n     draw me the thread,\n     spread it over with pitch,\n     knock the nail on the head.\n\nThe shoemaker, however, could not bear a joke, he pulled a face as if\nhe had drunk vinegar, and made a gesture as if he were about to seize\nthe tailor by the throat.  But the little fellow began to laugh,\nreached him his bottle, and said, \"No harm was meant, take a drink,\nand swallow your anger down.\" The shoemaker took a very hearty drink,\nand the storm on his face began to clear away. He gave the bottle\nback to the tailor, and said, \"I took a hearty gulp, they say it\ncomes from much drinking, but not from great thirst.  Shall we travel\ntogether?\" \"All right,\" answered the tailor, \"if only it suits you to\ngo into a big town where there is no lack of work.\" \"That is just\nwhere I want to go,\" answered the shoemaker.  \"In a small hamlet\nthere is nothing to earn, and in the country, people like to go\nbarefoot.\" They traveled therefore onwards together, and always set\none foot before the other like a weasel in the snow.\n\nBoth of them had time enough, but little to bite and to break. When\nthey reached a town they went about and paid their respects to the\ntradesmen, and because the tailor looked so lively and merry, and had\nsuch fine red cheeks, every one gave him work willingly, and when\nluck was good the master's daughters gave him a kiss beneath the\nporch, as well.  When he again fell in with the shoemaker, the tailor\nhad always the most in his bundle. The ill-tempered shoemaker made a\nwry face, and thought, the greater the rascal the more the luck.  But\nthe tailor began to laugh and to sing, and shared all he got with his\ncomrade.  If a couple of pence jingled in his pockets, he ordered\ngood cheer, and thumped the table in his joy till the glasses danced\nand it was lightly come, lightly go, with him.\n\nWhen they had traveled for some time, they came to a great forest\nthrough which passed the road to the capital.  Two foot-paths,\nhowever, led through it, one of which was a seven days, journey and\nthe other only two, but neither of the travelers knew which way was\nthe short one.  They seated themselves beneath an oak-tree, and took\ncounsel together how they should forecast, and for how many days they\nshould provide themselves with bread.\n\nThe shoemaker said, \"One must look before one leaps, I will take with\nme bread for a week.\" \"What,\" said the tailor, \"drag bread for seven\ndays on one's back like a beast of burden and not be able to look\nabout?  I shall trust in God, and not trouble myself about anything.\nThe money I have in my pocket is as good in summer as in winter, but\nin hot weather bread gets dry, and moldy into the bargain, even my\ncoat does not last as far as it might.  Besides, why should we not\nfind the right way?  Bread for two days, and that's enough.\" Each,\ntherefore, bought his own bread, and then they tried their luck in\nthe forest.\n\nIt was as quiet there as in a church.  No wind stirred, no brook\nmurmured, no bird sang, and through the thickly-leaved branches no\nsunbeam forced its way.  The shoemaker spoke never a word, the bread\nweighed so heavily on his back that the sweat streamed down his cross\nand gloomy face.  The tailor, however, was quite merry, he jumped\nabout, whistled on a leaf, or sang a song, and thought to himself,\nGod in heaven must be pleased to see me so happy.\n\nThis lasted two days, but on the third the forest would not come to\nan end, and the tailor had eaten up all his bread, so after all his\nheart sank down a yard deeper.  Nevertheless, he did not lose\ncourage, but relied on God and on his luck.  On the evening of the\nthird day he lay down hungry under a tree, and rose again next\nmorning hungry still, so also passed the fourth day, and when the\nshoemaker seated himself on a fallen tree and devoured his dinner the\ntailor was only a spectator.  If he begged for a little piece of\nbread, the other laughed mockingly, and said, \"You have always been\nso merry, now you can see for once what it is to be sad, the birds\nwhich sing too early in the morning are struck by the hawk in the\nevening.\" In short, he was pitiless.  But on the fifth morning the\npoor tailor could no longer stand up, and was hardly able to utter\none word for weakness, his cheeks were white, and his eyes were red.\nThen the shoemaker said to him, \"I will give you a bit of bread\nto-day, but in return for it, I will put out your right eye.\" The\nunhappy tailor who still wished to save his life, had to submit, he\nwept once more with both eyes, and then held them out, and the\nshoemaker, who had a heart of stone, put out his right eye with a\nsharp knife.  The tailor called to remembrance what his mother had\nformerly said to him when he had been eating secretly in the pantry.\nEat what one can, and suffer what one must.  When he had consumed his\ndearly-bought bread, he got on his legs again, forgot his misery and\ncomforted himself with the thought that he could always see enough\nwith one eye.\n\nBut on the sixth day, hunger made itself felt again and gnawed him\nalmost to the heart.  In the evening he fell down by a tree, and on\nthe seventh morning he could not raise himself up for faintness, and\ndeath was close at hand.  Then said the shoemaker, \"I will show mercy\nand give you bread once more, but you shall not have it for nothing,\nI shall put out your other eye for it.\"\n\nAnd now the tailor felt how thoughtless his life had been, prayed to\nGod for forgiveness, and said, \"Do what you will, I will bear what I\nmust, but remember that our Lord God does not always look on\npassively, and that an hour will come when the evil deed which you\nhave done to me, and which I have not deserved of you, will be\nrequited.  When times were good with me, I shared what I had with\nyou.  My trade is of that kind that each stitch must always be\nexactly like the other.  If I no longer have my eyes and can sew no\nmore I must go a-begging.  At any rate do not leave me here alone\nwhen I am blind, or I shall die of hunger.\" The shoemaker, however,\nwho had driven God out of his heart, took the knife and put out his\nleft eye.  Then he gave him a bit of bread to eat, held out a stick\nto him, and drew him on behind him.\n\nWhen the sun went down, they got out of the forest, and before them\nin the open country stood the gallows.  Thither the shoemaker guided\nthe blind tailor, and then left him alone and went his way.\nWeariness, pain, and hunger made the wretched man fall asleep, and he\nslept the whole night.  When day dawned he awoke, but knew not where\nhe lay.  Two poor sinners were hanging on the gallows, and a crow sat\non the head of each of them.  Then one of the men who had been hanged\nbegan to speak, and said, \"Brother, are you awake?\" \"Yes, I am\nawake,\" answered the second.  \"Then I will tell you something,\" said\nthe first, \"the dew which this night has fallen down over us from the\ngallows, gives every one who washes himself with it his eyes again.\nIf blind people did but know this, how many would regain their sight\nwho do not believe that to be possible.\"\n\nWhen the tailor heard that, he took his pocket-handkerchief, pressed\nit on the grass, and when it was moist with dew, washed the sockets\nof his eyes with it.  Immediately was fulfilled what the man on the\ngallows had said, and a couple of healthy new eyes filled the\nsockets.  It was not long before the tailor saw the sun rise behind\nthe mountains, in the plain before him lay the great royal city with\nits magnificent gates and hundred towers, and the golden balls and\ncrosses which were on the spires began to shine.  He could\ndistinguish every leaf on the trees, saw the birds which flew past,\nand the midges which danced in the air. He took a needle out of his\npocket, and as he could thread it as well as ever he had done, his\nheart danced with delight.  He threw himself on his knees, thanked\nGod for the mercy he had shown him, and said his morning prayer.  Nor\ndid he forget to pray for the poor sinners who were hanging there\nswinging against each other in the wind like the pendulums of clocks.\nThen he took his bundle on his back and soon forgot the pain of heart\nhe had endured, and went on his way singing and whistling.\n\nThe first thing he met was a brown foal running about the fields at\nlarge.  He caught it by the mane, and wanted to spring on it and ride\ninto the town.  The foal, however, begged to be set free.  \"I am\nstill too young,\" it said, \"even a light tailor such as you are would\nbreak my back in two - let me go till I have grown strong.  A time\nmay perhaps come when I may reward you for it.\" \"Run off,\" said the\ntailor, \"I see you are still a giddy thing.\" He gave it a touch with\na switch over its back, whereupon it kicked up its hind legs for joy,\nleapt over hedges and ditches, and galloped away into the open\ncountry.\n\nBut the little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before. The sun\nto be sure fills my eyes, said he, but the bread does not fill my\nmouth.  The first thing that comes my way and is even half edible\nwill have to suffer for it.  In the meantime a stork stepped solemnly\nover the meadow towards him.  \"Halt, halt,\" cried the tailor, and\nseized him by the leg.  \"I don't know if you are good to eat or not,\nbut my hunger leaves me no great choice.  I must cut your head off,\nand roast you.\" \"Don't do that,\" replied the stork, \"I am a sacred\nbird which brings mankind great profit, and no one does me an injury.\nLeave me my life, and I may do you good in some other way.\" \"Well, be\noff, cousin longlegs,\" said the tailor.  The stork rose up, let its\nlong legs hang down, and flew gently away.\n\n\"What's to be the end of this,\" said the tailor to himself at last,\n\"my hunger grows greater and greater, and my stomach more and more\nempty.  Whatsoever comes in my way now is lost.\" At this point he saw\na couple of young ducks which were on a pond come swimming towards\nhim.  \"You come just at the right moment,\" said he, and laid hold of\none of them and was about to wring its neck.  On this an old duck\nwhich was hidden among the reeds, began to scream loudly, and swam to\nhim with open beak, and begged him urgently to spare her dear\nchildren.  \"Can you not imagine,\" said she, \"how your mother would\nmourn if any one wanted to carry you off, and give you your finishing\nstroke.\" \"Just be quiet,\" said the good-tempered tailor, \"you shall\nkeep your children,\" and put the prisoner back into the water.\n\nWhen he turned round, he was standing in front of an old tree which\nwas partly hollow, and saw some wild bees flying in and out of it.\n\"There I shall at once find the reward of my good deed,\" said the\ntailor, \"the honey will refresh me.\" But the queen-bee came out,\nthreatened him and said, \"If you touch my people and destroy my nest,\nour stings shall pierce your skin like ten thousand red-hot needles.\nBut if you leave us in peace and go your way, we will do you a\nservice for it another time.\"\n\nThe little tailor saw that here also nothing was to be done. Three\ndishes empty and nothing on the fourth is a bad dinner.  He dragged\nhimself therefore with his starved-out stomach into the town, and as\nit was just striking twelve, all was ready-cooked for him in the inn,\nand he was able to sit down at once to dinner. When he was satisfied\nhe said, \"Now I will get to work.\" He went round the town, sought a\nmaster, and soon found a good situation. And as he had thoroughly\nlearnt his trade, it was not long before he became famous, and every\none wanted to have his new coat made by the little tailor, whose\nimportance increased daily.  \"I can go no further in skill,\" said he,\n\"and yet things improve every day.\" At last the king appointed him\ncourt-tailor.\n\nBut what odd things do happen in the world.  On the very same day his\nformer comrade the shoemaker also became court-shoemaker. When the\nlatter caught sight of the tailor, and saw that he had once more two\nhealthy eyes, his conscience troubled him.  \"Before he takes revenge\non me,\" thought he to himself, \"I must dig a pit for him.\" He,\nhowever, who digs a pit for another, falls into it himself.  In the\nevening when work was over and it had grown dusk, he stole to the\nking and said, \"Lord king, the tailor is an arrogant fellow and has\nboasted that he will get the golden crown back again which was lost\nin ancient times.\" \"That would please me very much,\" said the king,\nand he caused the tailor to be brought before him next morning, and\nordered him to get the crown back again, or to leave the town for\never.  \"Oho,\" thought the tailor, \"a rogue gives more than he has\ngot.  If the surly king wants me to do what can be done by no one, I\nwill not wait till morning, but will go out of the town at once,\nto-day.\"\n\nHe packed up his bundle, therefore, but when he was without the gate\nhe could not help being sorry to give up his good fortune, and turn\nhis back on the town in which all had gone so well with him.  He came\nto the pond where he had made the acquaintance of the ducks, at that\nvery moment the old one whose young ones he had spared, was sitting\nthere by the shore, pluming herself with her beak. She knew him again\ninstantly, and asked why he was hanging his head so.  \"You will not\nbe surprised when you hear what has befallen me,\" replied the tailor,\nand told her his fate.  \"If that be all,\" said the duck, \"we can help\nyou.  The crown fell into the water, and it lies down below at the\nbottom, we will soon bring it up again for you.  In the meantime just\nspread out your handkerchief on the bank.\" She dived down with her\ntwelve young ones, and in five minutes she was up again and sat with\nthe crown resting on her wings, and the twelve young ones were\nswimming round about and had put their beaks under it, and were\nhelping to carry it. They swam to the shore and put the crown on the\nhandkerchief. No one can imagine how magnificent the crown was, when\nthe sun shone on it, it gleamed like a hundred thousand carbuncles.\nThe tailor tied his handkerchief together by the four corners, and\ncarried it to the king, who was full of joy, and put a gold chain\nround the tailor's neck.\n\nWhen the shoemaker saw that one blow had failed, he contrived a\nsecond, and went to the king and said, \"Lord king, the tailor has\nbecome insolent again, he boasts that he will copy in wax the whole\nof the royal palace, with everything that pertains to it, loose or\nfast, inside and out.\" The king sent for the tailor and ordered him\nto copy in wax the whole of the royal palace, with everything that\npertained to it, movable or immovable, within and without, and if he\ndid not succeed in doing this, or if so much as one nail on the wall\nwere wanting, he should be imprisoned for his whole life underground.\n\nThe tailor thought, \"It gets worse and worse.  No one can endure\nthat,\" and threw his bundle on his back, and went forth.  When he\ncame to the hollow tree, he sat down and hung his head.  The bees\ncame flying out, and the queen-bee asked him if he had a stiff neck,\nsince he hung his head so.  \"Alas, no,\" answered the tailor,\n\"something quite different weighs me down,\" and he told her what the\nking had demanded of him.  The bees began to buzz and hum amongst\nthemselves, and the queen-bee said, \"Just go home again, but come\nback to-morrow at this time, and bring a large sheet with you, and\nthen all will be well.\" So he turned back again, but the bees flew to\nthe royal palace and straight into it through the open windows, crept\nround about into every corner, and inspected everything most\ncarefully.  Then they hurried back and modelled the palace in wax\nwith such rapidity that any one looking on would have thought it was\ngrowing before his eyes.  By the evening all was ready, and when the\ntailor came next morning, the whole of the splendid building was\nthere, and not one nail in the wall or tile of the roof was wanting,\nand it was delicate withal, and white as snow, and smelt sweet as\nhoney.  The tailor wrapped it carefully in his cloth and took it to\nthe king, who could not admire it enough, placed it in his largest\nhall, and in return for it presented the tailor with a large stone\nhouse.\n\nThe shoemaker, however, did not give up, but went for the third time\nto the king and said, \"Lord king, it has come to the tailor's ears\nthat no water will spring up in the court-yard of the castle and he\nhas boasted that it shall rise up in the midst of the court-yard to a\nman's height and be clear as crystal.\" Then the king ordered the\ntailor to be brought before him and said, \"If a stream of water does\nnot rise in my court-yard by to-morrow as you have promised, the\nexecutioner shall in that very place make you shorter by a head.\" The\npoor tailor did not take long to think about it, but hurried out to\nthe gate, and because this time it was a matter of life and death to\nhim, tears rolled down his face.\n\nWhile he was thus going forth full of sorrow, the foal to which he\nhad formerly given its liberty, and which had now become a beautiful\nchestnut horse, came leaping towards him.  \"The time has come,\" it\nsaid to the tailor, \"when I can repay you for your good deed.  I know\nalready what is needful to you, but you shall soon have help, get on\nme, my back can carry two such as you.\" The tailor's courage came\nback to him, he jumped up in one bound, and the horse went full speed\ninto the town, and right up to the court-yard of the castle. It\ngalloped as quick as lightning thrice round it, and at the third time\nit fell violently down.  At the same instant, however, there was a\nterrific clap of thunder, a fragment of earth in the middle of the\ncourt-yard sprang like a cannon-ball into the air, and over the\ncastle, and directly after it a jet of water rose as high as a man on\nhorseback, and the water was as pure as crystal, and the sunbeams\nbegan to dance on it.  When the king saw this, he arose in amazement,\nand went and embraced the tailor in the sight of all men.\n\nBut good fortune did not last long.  The king had daughters in\nplenty, one still prettier than the other, but he had no son. So the\nmalicious shoemaker betook himself for the fourth time to the king,\nand said, \"Lord king, the tailor has not given up his arrogance.  He\nhas now boasted that if he liked, he could cause a son to be brought\nto the lord king through the air.\" The king commanded the tailor to\nbe summoned, and said, \"If you cause a son to be brought to me within\nnine days, you shall have my eldest daughter to wife.\" \"The reward is\nindeed great,\" thought the little tailor, \"one would willingly do\nsomething for it, but the cherries grow too high for me, if I climb\nfor them, the bough will break beneath me, and I shall fall.\"\n\nHe went home, seated himself cross-legged on his work-table, and\nthought over what was to be done.  \"It can't be managed,\" cried he at\nlast, \"I will go away, after all, I can't live in peace here.\" He\ntied up his bundle and hurried away to the gate.  When he got to the\nmeadow, he perceived his old friend the stork, who was walking\nbackwards and forwards like a philosopher.  Sometimes he stood still,\ntook a frog into close consideration, and at length swallowed it\ndown.  The stork came to him and greeted him.  \"I see,\" he began,\n\"that you have your pack on your back.  Why are you leaving the\ntown?\" The tailor told him what the king had required of him, and how\nhe could not perform it, and lamented his misfortune. \"Don't let that\nturn your hair grey,\" said the stork, \"I will help you out of your\ndifficulty.  For a long time now, I have carried the children in\nswaddling-clothes into the town, so for once in a way, I can fetch a\nlittle prince out of the well.  Go home and be easy.  In nine days\nfrom this time repair to the royal palace, and there will I come.\"\nThe little tailor went home, and at the appointed time was at the\ncastle.  It was not long before the stork came flying thither and\ntapped at the window.  The tailor opened it, and cousin longlegs came\ncarefully in, and walked with solemn steps over the smooth marble\npavement.  He had, moreover, a baby in his beak that was as lovely as\nan angel, and stretched out its little hands to the queen.  The stork\nlaid it in her lap, and she caressed it and kissed it, and was beside\nherself with delight.  Before the stork flew away, he took his\ntraveling bag off his back and handed it over to the queen.  In it\nthere were little paper parcels with colored sweetmeats, and they\nwere divided amongst the little princesses.  The eldest, however,\nreceived none of them, but instead got the merry tailor for a\nhusband.  \"It seems to me,\" said he, \"just as if I had won the\nhighest prize.  My mother was if right after all, she always said\nthat whoever trusts in God and only has good luck, can never fail.\"\n\nThe shoemaker had to make the shoes in which the little tailor danced\nat the wedding festival, after which he was commanded to quit the\ntown for ever.  The road to the forest led him to the gallows.  Worn\nout with anger, rage, and the heat of the day, he threw himself down.\nWhen he had closed his eyes and was about to sleep, the two crows\nflew down from the heads of the men who were hanging there, and\npecked his eyes out.  In his madness he ran into the forest and must\nhave died there of hunger, for no one has ever either seen him or\nheard of him again.\n", "Hans the Hedgehog": "\tHans the Hedgehog\n\nThere was once a country man who had money and land in plenty, but\nhowever rich he was, his happiness was still lacking in one respect -\nhe had no children.  Often when he went into the town with the other\npeasants they mocked him and asked why he had no children.  At last\nhe became angry, and when he got home he said, \"I will have a child,\neven if it be a hedgehog.\" Then his wife had a child that was a\nhedgehog in the upper part of his body and a boy in the lower, and\nwhen she saw the child, she was terrified, and said, \"See, there you\nhave brought ill-luck on us.\" Then said the man, \"What can be done\nnow?  The boy must be christened, but we shall not be able to get a\ngodfather for him.\" The woman said, \"And we cannot call him anything\nelse but Hans the hedgehog.\"\n\nWhen he was christened, the parson said, \"He cannot go into any\nordinary bed because of his spikes.\" So a little straw was put behind\nthe stove, and Hans the hedgehog was laid on it.  His mother could\nnot suckle him, for he would have pricked her with his quills.  So he\nlay there behind the stove for eight years, and his father was tired\nof him and thought, if he would but die.  He did not die, however,\nbut remained lying there.\n\nNow it happened that there was a fair in the town, and the peasant\nwas about to go to it, and asked his wife what he should bring back\nwith him for her.  \"A little meat and a couple of white rolls which\nare wanted for the house,\" said she.  Then he asked the servant, and\nshe wanted a pair of slippers and some stockings with clocks. At last\nhe said also, \"And what will you have, Hans my hedgehog?\" \"Dear\nfather,\" he said, \"do bring me bagpipes.\" When, therefore, the father\ncame home again, he gave his wife what he had bought for her, meat\nand white rolls, and then he gave the maid the slippers, and the\nstockings with clocks, and, lastly, he went behind the stove, and\ngave Hans the hedgehog the bagpipes.\n\nAnd when Hans the hedgehog had the bagpipes, he said, \"Dear father,\ndo go to the forge and get the cock shod, and then I will ride away,\nand never come back again.\" At this, the father was delighted to\nthink that he was going to get rid of him, and had the cock shod for\nhim, and when it was done, Hans the hedgehog got on it, and rode\naway, but took swine and asses with him which he intended to keep in\nthe forest.  When they got there he made the cock fly on to a high\ntree with him, and there he sat for many a long year, and watched his\nasses and swine until the herd was quite large, and his father knew\nnothing about him.  And while he was sitting in the tree, he played\nhis bagpipes, and made music which was very beautiful.\n\nOnce a king came traveling by who had lost his way and heard the\nmusic.  He was astonished at it, and sent his servant forth to look\nall round and see from whence this music came.  He spied about, but\nsaw nothing but a little animal sitting up aloft on the tree, which\nlooked like a cock with a hedgehog on it which made this music.  Then\nthe king told the servant he was to ask why he sat there, and if he\nknew the road which led to his kingdom.  So Hans the hedgehog\ndescended from the tree, and said he would show the way if the king\nwould write a bond and promise him whatever he first met in the royal\ncourtyard as soon as he arrived at home.  Then the king thought, I\ncan easily do that, Hans the hedgehog understands nothing, and I can\nwrite what I like.  So the king took pen and ink and wrote something,\nand when he had done it, Hans the hedgehog showed him the way, and he\ngot safely home.  But his daughter, when she saw him from afar, was\nso overjoyed that she ran to meet him, and kissed him.  Then he\nremembered Hans the hedgehog, and told her what had happened, and\nthat he had been forced to promise whatsoever first met him when he\ngot home, to a very strange animal which sat on a cock as if it were\na horse, and made beautiful music, but that instead of writing that\nhe should have what he wanted, he had written that he should not have\nit. Thereupon the princess was glad, and said he had done well, for\nshe never would have gone away with the hedgehog.\n\nHans the hedgehog, however, looked after his asses and pigs, and was\nalways merry and sat on the tree and played his bagpipes. Now it came\nto pass that another king came journeying by with his attendants and\nrunner, and he also had lost his way, and did not know how to get\nhome again because the forest was so large.  He likewise heard the\nbeautiful music from a distance, and asked his runner what that could\nbe, and told him to go and see.  Then the runner went under the tree,\nand saw the cock sitting at the top of it, and Hans the hedgehog on\nthe cock.  The runner asked him what he was doing up there.  I am\nkeeping my asses and my pigs, but what is your desire.  The messenger\nsaid that they had lost their way, and could not get back into their\nown kingdom, and asked if he would not show them the way.  Then Hans\nthe hedgehog descended the tree with the cock, and told the aged king\nthat he would show him the way, if he would give him for his own\nwhatsoever first met him in front of his royal palace.  The king\nsaid, \"Yes,\" and wrote a promise to Hans the hedgehog that he should\nhave this.  That done, Hans rode on before him on the cock, and\npointed out the way, and the king reached his kingdom again in\nsafety.  When he got to the courtyard, there were great rejoicings.\nNow he had an only daughter who was very beautiful, she ran to meet\nhim, threw her arms round his neck, and was delighted to have her old\nfather back again.  She asked him where in the world he had been so\nlong.  So he told her how he had lost his way, and had very nearly\nnot come back at all, but that as he was traveling through a great\nforest, a creature, half hedgehog, half man, who was sitting astride\na cock in a high tree, and making music, had shown him the way and\nhelped him to get out, but that in return he had promised him\nwhatsoever first met him in the royal court-yard, and how that was\nshe herself, which made him unhappy now.  But on this she promised\nthat, for love of her father, she would willingly go with this Hans\nif he came.\n\nHans the hedgehog, however, took care of his pigs, and the pigs\nbecame more pigs until there were so many in number that the whole\nforest was filled with them.  Then Hans the hedgehog resolved not to\nlive in the forest any longer, and sent word to his father to have\nevery stye in the village emptied, for he was coming with such a\ngreat herd that all might kill who wished to do so.  When his father\nheard that, he was troubled, for he thought Hans the hedgehog had\ndied long ago.  Hans the hedgehog, however, seated himself on the\ncock, and drove the pigs before him into the village, and ordered the\nslaughter to begin.\n\nHa. - Then there was a butchery and a chopping that might have been\nheard two miles off.  After this Hans the hedgehog said, \"Father, let\nme have the cock shod once more at the forge, and then I will ride\naway and never come back as long as I live.\" Then the father had the\ncock shod once more, and was pleased that Hans the hedgehog would\nnever return again.\n\nHans the hedgehog rode away to the first kingdom.  There the king had\ncommanded that whosoever came mounted on a cock and had bagpipes with\nhim should be shot at, cut down, or stabbed by everyone, so that he\nmight not enter the palace.  When, therefore, Hans the hedgehog came\nriding thither, they all pressed forward against him with their\npikes, but he spurred the cock and it flew up over the gate in front\nof the king's window and lighted there, and Hans cried that the king\nmust give him what he had promised, or he would take both his life\nand his daughter's.  Then the king began to speak to his daughter,\nand to beg her to go away with Hans in order to save her own life and\nher father's.  So she dressed herself in white, and her father gave\nher a carriage with six horses and magnificent attendants together\nwith gold and possessions.  She seated herself in the carriage, and\nplaced Hans the hedgehog beside her with the cock and the bagpipes,\nand then they took leave and drove away, and the king thought he\nshould never see her again.  But he was deceived in his expectation\nfor when they were at a short distance from the town, Hans the\nhedgehog took her pretty clothes off, and pierced her with his\nhedgehog's spikes until she bled all over.  \"That is the reward of\nyour falseness,\" said he. \"Go your way, I will not have you,\" and on\nthat he chased her home again, and she was disgraced for the rest of\nher life.\n\nHans the hedgehog, however, rode on further on the cock, with his\nbagpipes, to the dominions of the second king to whom he had shown\nthe way.  But this one had arranged that if any one resembling Hans\nthe hedgehog should come, they were to present arms, give him safe\nconduct, cry long life to him, and lead him to the royal palace.\n\nBut when the king's daughter saw him she was terrified, for he really\nlooked too strange.  Then she remembered that she could not change\nher mind, for she had given her promise to her father. So Hans the\nhedgehog was welcomed by her, and married to her, and had to go with\nher to the royal table, and she seated herself by his side, and they\nate and drank.  When the evening came and they wanted to go to sleep,\nshe was afraid of his quills, but he told her she was not to fear,\nfor no harm would befall her, and he told the old king that he was to\nappoint four men to watch by the door of the chamber, and light a\ngreat fire, and when he entered the room and was about to get into\nbed, he would creep out of his hedgehog's skin and leave it lying\nthere by the bedside, and that the men were to run nimbly to it,\nthrow it in the fire, and stay by it until it was consumed.\n\nWhen the clock struck eleven, he went into the chamber, stripped off\nthe hedgehog's skin, and left it lying by the bed.  Then came the men\nand fetched it swiftly, and threw it in the fire, and when the fire\nhad consumed it, he was saved, and lay there in bed in human form,\nbut he was coal-black as if he had been burnt.  The king sent for his\nphysician who washed him with precious salves, and anointed him, and\nhe became white, and was a handsome young man.  When the king's\ndaughter saw that she was glad, and the next morning they arose\njoyfully, ate and drank, and then the marriage was properly\nsolemnized, and Hans the hedgehog received the kingdom from the aged\nking.\n\nWhen several years had passed he went with his wife to his father,\nand said that he was his son.  The father, however, declared he had\nno son - he had never had but one, and he had been born like a\nhedgehog with spikes, and had gone forth into the world. Then Hans\nmade himself known, and the old father rejoiced and went with him to\nhis kingdom.\n                    My tale is done,\n                    and away it has run\n                    to little augusta's house.\n", "The Shroud": "There was once a mother who had a little boy of seven years old, who\nwas so handsome and lovable that no one could look at him without\nliking him, and she herself worshipped him above everything in the\nworld.  Now it so happened that he suddenly became ill, and God took\nhim to himself, and for this the mother could not be comforted and\nwept both day and night.  But soon afterwards, when the child had\nbeen buried, it appeared by night in the places where it had sat and\nplayed during its life, and if the mother wept, it wept also, and\nwhen morning came it disappeared.  But as the mother would not stop\ncrying, it came one night, in the little white shroud in which it had\nbeen laid in its coffin, and with its wreath of flowers round its\nhead, and stood on the bed at her feet, and said, \"Oh, mother, do\nstop crying, or I shall never fall asleep in my coffin, for my shroud\nwill not dry because of all your tears, which fall upon it.\" The\nmother was afraid when she heard that, and wept no more.  The next\nnight the child came again, and held a little light in its hand, and\nsaid, \"Look, mother, my shroud is nearly dry, and I can rest in my\ngrave.\" Then the mother gave her sorrow into God's keeping, and bore\nit quietly and patiently, and the child came no more, but slept in\nits little bed beneath the earth.\n", "The Skilful Huntsman": "There was once a young fellow who had learnt the trade of locksmith,\nand told his father he would now go out into the world and seek his\nfortune.  Very well, said the father, I am quite content with that,\nand gave him some money for his journey.  So he traveled about and\nlooked for work.  After a time he resolved not to follow the trade of\nlocksmith any more, for he no longer liked it, but he took a fancy\nfor hunting.\n\nThen there met him in his rambles a huntsman dressed in green, who\nasked whence he came and whither he was going.  The youth said he was\na locksmith's apprentice, but that the trade no longer pleased him,\nand he had a liking for huntsmanship, would he teach it to him.  \"Oh,\nyes,\" said the huntsman, \"if you will go with me.\" Then the young\nfellow went with him, apprenticed himself to him for some years, and\nlearnt the art of hunting.  After this he wished to try his luck\nelsewhere, and the huntsman gave him nothing in the way of payment\nbut an air-gun, which had, however, this property, that it hit its\nmark without fail whenever he shot with it.  Then he set out and\nfound himself in a very large forest, which he could not get to the\nend of in one day.  When evening came he seated himself in a high\ntree in order to escape from the wild beasts.\n\nTowards midnight, it seemed to him as if a tiny little light\nglimmered in the distance.  Then he looked down through the branches\ntowards it, and kept well in his mind where it was.  But in the first\nplace he took off his hat and threw it down in the direction of the\nlight, so that he might go to the hat as a mark when he had\ndescended.  He got down and went to his hat, put it on again and went\nstraight forwards.  The farther he went, the larger the light grew,\nand when he got close to it he saw that it was an enormous fire, and\nthat three giants were sitting by it, who had an ox on the spit, and\nwere roasting it.  Presently one of them said, \"I must just taste if\nthe meat will soon be fit to eat,\" and pulled a piece off, and was\nabout to put it in his mouth when the huntsman shot it out of his\nhand.  \"Well, really,\" said the giant, \"if the wind has not blown the\nbit out of my hand,\" and helped himself to another.  But when he was\njust about to bite into it, the huntsman again shot it away from him.\nOn this the giant gave the one who was sitting next him a box on the\near, and cried angrily, \"Why are you snatching my piece away from\nme?\" \"I have not snatched it away,\" said the other, \"a sharpshooter\nmust have shot it away from you.\"\n\nThe giant took another piece, but again could not keep it in his\nhand, for the huntsman shot it out.  Then the giant said, \"That must\nbe a good shot to shoot the bit out of one's very mouth, such an one\nwould be useful to us.\" And he cried aloud, \"Come here, you\nsharpshooter, seat yourself at the fire beside us and eat your fill,\nwe will not hurt you, but if you will not come, and we have to bring\nyou by force, you are a lost man.\"\n\nOn this the youth went up to them and told them he was a skilled\nhuntsman, and that whatever he aimed at with his gun, he was certain\nto hit.  Then they said if he would go with them he should be well\ntreated, and they told him that outside the forest there was a great\nlake, behind which stood a tower, and in the tower was imprisoned a\nlovely princess, whom they wished very much to carry off.  \"Yes,\"\nsaid he, \"I will soon get her for you.\" Then they added, \"But there\nis still something else, there is a tiny little dog, which begins to\nbark directly any one goes near, and as soon as it barks every one in\nthe royal palace wakens up, and for this reason we cannot get there,\ncan you undertake to shoot it dead?\" \"Yes,\" said he, \"that will be\nquite fun for me.\" After this he got into a boat and rowed over the\nlake, and as soon as he landed, the little dog came running out, and\nwas about to bark, but the huntsman took his airgun and shot it dead.\n\nWhen the giants saw that, they rejoiced, and thought they already had\nthe king's daughter safe, but the huntsman wished first to see how\nmatters stood, and told them that they must stay outside until he\ncalled them.  Then he went into the castle, and all was perfectly\nquiet within, and every one was asleep.  When he opened the door of\nthe first room, a sword was hanging on the wall which was made of\npure silver, and there was a golden star on it, and the name of the\nking, and on a table near it lay a sealed letter which he broke open,\nand inside it was written that whosoever had the sword could kill\neverything which opposed him.  So he took the sword from the wall,\nhung it at his side and went onwards, then he entered the room where\nthe king's daughter was lying sleeping, and she was so beautiful that\nhe stood still and, holding his breath, looked at her.  He thought to\nhimself, \"How can I give an innocent maiden into the power of the\nwild giants, who have evil in their minds?\" He looked about further,\nand under the bed stood a pair of slippers, on the right one was her\nfather's name with a star, and on the left her own name with a star.\nShe wore also a large scarf of silk embroidered with gold, and on the\nright side was her father's name, and on the left her own, all in\ngolden letters.  Then the huntsman took a pair of scissors and cut\nthe right corner off, and put it in his knapsack, and then he also\ntook the right slipper with the king's name, and thrust that in.  Now\nthe maiden still lay sleeping, and she was quite sewn into her\nnight-dress, and he cut a morsel from this also, and thrust it in\nwith the rest, but he did all without touching her.\n\nThen he went forth and left her lying asleep undisturbed, and when he\ncame to the gate again, the giants were still standing outside\nwaiting for him, and expecting that he was bringing the princess.\nBut he cried to them that they were to come in, for the maiden was\nalready in their power, that he could not open the gate to them, but\nthere was a hole through which they must creep.  Then the first\napproached, and the huntsman wound the giant's hair round his hand,\npulled the head in, and cut it off at one stroke with his sword, and\nthen drew the rest of him in.  He called to the second and cut his\nhead off likewise, and then he killed the third also, and he was well\npleased that he had freed the beautiful maiden from her enemies, and\nhe cut out their tongues and put them in his knapsack. Then thought\nhe, \"I will go home to my father and let him see what I have already\ndone, and afterwards I will travel about the world, the luck which\nGod is pleased to grant me will easily find me.\"\n\nBut when the king in the castle awoke, he saw the three giants lying\nthere dead.  So he went into the sleeping-room of his daughter, awoke\nher, and asked who could have killed the giants. Then said she, \"Dear\nfather, I know not, I have been asleep.\" But when she arose and would\nhave put on her slippers, the right one was gone, and when she looked\nat her scarf it was cut, and the right corner was missing, and when\nshe looked at her night-dress a piece was cut out of it.  The king\nsummoned his whole court together, soldiers and every one else who\nwas there, and asked who had set his daughter at liberty, and killed\nthe giants.\n\nNow it happened that he had a captain, who was one-eyed and a hideous\nman, and he said that he had done it.  Then the old king said that as\nhe had accomplished this, he should marry his daughter.  But the\nmaiden said, \"Rather than marry him, dear father, I will go away into\nthe world as far as my legs can carry me.\" But the king said that if\nshe would not marry him she should take off her royal garments and\nwear peasant's clothing, and go forth, and that she should go to a\npotter, and begin a trade in earthen vessels.\n\nSo she put off her royal apparel, and went to a potter and borrowed\ncrockery enough for a stall, and she promised him also that if she\nhad sold it by the evening, she would pay for it. Then the king said\nshe was to seat herself in a corner with it and sell it, and he\narranged with some peasants to drive over it with their carts, so\nthat everything should be broken into a thousand pieces.  When\ntherefore the king's daughter had placed her stall in the street, by\ncame the carts, and broke all she had into tiny fragments.  She began\nto weep and said, \"Alas, how shall I ever pay for the pots now.\" The\nking, however, had wished by this to force her to marry the captain;\nbut instead of that, she again went to the potter, and asked him if\nhe would lend to her once more.  He said, no, she must first pay for\nwhat she already had.\n\nThen she went to her father and cried and lamented, and said she\nwould go forth into the world.  Then said he, \"I will have a little\nhut built for you in the forest outside, and in it you shall stay all\nyour life long and cook for every one, but you shall take no money\nfor it.\" When the hut was ready, a sign was hung on the door whereon\nwas written, to-day given, to-morrow sold.  There she remained a long\ntime, and it was rumored about the world that a maiden was there who\ncooked without asking for payment, and that this was set forth on a\nsign outside her door.\n\nThe huntsman heard it likewise, and thought to himself, that would\nsuit you.  You are poor, and have no money.  So he took his air-gun\nand his knapsack, wherein all the things which he had formerly\ncarried away with him from the castle as tokens of his truthfulness\nwere still lying, and went into the forest, and found the hut with\nthe sign, to-day given, to-morrow sold.  He had put on the sword with\nwhich he had cut off the heads of the three giants, and thus entered\nthe hut, and ordered something to eat to be given to him.  He was\ncharmed with the beautiful maiden, who was indeed as lovely as any\npicture.  She asked him whence he came and whither he was going, and\nhe said, \"I am roaming about the world.\" Then she asked him where he\nhad got the sword, for that truly her father's name was on it.  He\nasked her if she were the king's daughter.  \"Yes,\" answered she.\n\"With this sword,\" said he, \"did I cut off the heads of three\ngiants.\" And he took their tongues out of his knapsack in proof.\nThen he also showed her the slipper, and the corner of the scarf, and\nthe piece of the night-dress.\n\nHereupon she was overjoyed, and said that he was the one who had\ndelivered her.  On this they went together to the old king, and\nfetched him to the hut, and she led him into her room, and told him\nthat the huntsman was the man who had really set her free from the\ngiants.  And when the aged king saw all the proofs of this, he could\nno longer doubt, and said that he was very glad he knew how\neverything had happened, and that the huntsman should have her to\nwife, on which the maiden was glad at heart.  Then she dressed the\nhuntsman as if he were a foreign lord, and the king ordered a feast\nto be prepared.  When they went to table, the captain sat on the left\nside of the king's daughter, but the huntsman was on the right, and\nthe captain thought he was a foreign lord who had come on a visit.\nWhen they had eaten and drunk, the old king said to the captain that\nhe would set before him something which he must guess.  \"Supposing\nsomeone said that he had killed the three giants and he were asked\nwhere the giants, tongues were, and he were forced to go and look,\nand there were none in their heads.  How could that have happened?\"\nThe captain said, \"Then they cannot have had any.\" \"Not so,\" said the\nking.  \"Every animal has a tongue,\" and then he likewise asked what\npunishment should be meted out to anyone who made such an answer.\nThe captain replied, \"He ought to be torn in pieces.\" Then the king\nsaid he had pronounced his own sentence, and the captain was put in\nprison and then torn in four pieces, but the king's daughter was\nmarried to the huntsman. After this he brought his father and mother,\nand they lived with their son in happiness, and after the death of\nthe old king he received the kingdom.\n", "The Two Kings' Children": "There was once upon a time a king who had a little boy in whose stars\nit had been foretold that he should be killed by a stag when he was\nsixteen years of age, and when he had reached that age the huntsmen\nonce went hunting with him.  In the forest, the king's son was\nseparated from the others, and all at once he saw a great stag which\nhe wanted to shoot, but could not hit.  At length he chased the stag\nso far that they were quite out of the forest, and then suddenly a\ngreat tall man was standing there instead of the stag, and said, \"It\nis well that I have you.  I have already ruined six pairs of glass\nskates with running after you, and have not been able to reach you.\"\n\nThen he took the king's son with him, and dragged him through a great\nlake to a great palace, and he had to sit down to table with him and\neat something.  When they had eaten something together the king said,\n\"I have three daughters, you must keep watch over the eldest for one\nnight, from nine in the evening till six in the morning, and every\ntime the clock strikes, I will come myself and call, and if you then\ngive me no answer, to-morrow morning you shall be put to death, but\nif you always give me an answer, you shall have her to wife.\"\n\nWhen the young folks went to the bedroom there stood a stone image of\nSt. Christopher, and the king's daughter said to it, \"My father will\ncome at nine o'clock, and every hour till it strikes three, when he\ncalls, give him an answer instead of the king's son.\" Then the stone\nimage of St. Christopher nodded its head quite quickly, and then more\nand more slowly till at last it again stood still.  The next morning\nthe king said to him, \"You have done the business well, but I cannot\ngive my daughter away. You must now watch a night by my second\ndaughter, and then I will consider with myself, whether you can have\nmy eldest daughter to wife, but I shall come every hour myself, and\nwhen I call you, answer me, and if I call you and you do not reply,\nyour blood shall flow.\"\n\nThen they both went into the sleeping-room, and there stood a still\nlarger stone image of St. Christopher, and the king's daughter said\nto it, \"If my father calls, answer him.\" Then the great stone image\nof St. Christopher again nodded its head quite quickly and then more\nand more slowly, until at last it stood still again.  And the king's\nson lay down on the threshold, put his hand under his head and slept.\nThe next morning the king said to him, \"You have done the business\nreally well, but I cannot give my daughter away, you must now watch a\nnight by the youngest princess, and then I will consider with myself\nwhether you can have my second daughter to wife.  But I shall come\nevery hour myself, and when I call you answer me, and if I call you\nand you answer not, your blood shall flow for me.\"\n\nThen they once more went to the sleeping-room together, and there was\na much greater and much taller image of St. Christopher than the two\nfirst had been.  The king's daughter said to it, \"When my father\ncalls, answer.\" Then the great tall stone image of St. Christopher\nnodded quite half an hour with its head, until at length the head\nstood still again.  And the king's son laid himself down on the\nthreshold of the door and slept.  The next morning the king said,\n\"You have indeed watched well, but I cannot give you my daughter now,\nI have a great forest, if you cut it down for me between six o'clock\nthis morning and six at night, I will think about it.\"\n\nThen he gave him a glass axe, a glass wedge, and a glass mallet.\nWhen he got into the wood, he began at once to cut, but the axe broke\nin two.  Then he took the wedge, and struck it once with the mallet,\nand it became as short and as small as sand.  Then he was much\ntroubled and believed he would have to die, and sat down and wept.\n\nNow when it was noon the king said, \"One of you girls must take him\nsomething to eat.\" \"No,\" said the two eldest, \"we will not take it to\nhim, the one by whom he last watched, can take him something.\" Then\nthe youngest was forced to go and take him something to eat.  When\nshe got into the forest, she asked him how he was getting on.  \"Oh,\"\nsaid he, \"I am getting on very badly.\" Then she said he was to come\nand just eat a little. \"Nay,\" said he, \"I cannot do that, I have to\ndie anyway, so I will eat no more.\" Then she spoke so kindly to him\nand begged him just to try, that he came and ate something.  When he\nhad eaten something she said, \"I will pick your lice a while, and\nthen you will feel happier.\"\n\nSo she loused him, and he became weary and fell asleep, and then she\ntook her handkerchief and made a knot in it, and struck it three\ntimes on the earth, and said, \"Earth-workers, come forth.\" In a\nmoment, numbers of little earth-men came forth, and asked what the\nking's daughter commanded.  Then said she, \"In three hours, time the\ngreat forest must be cut down, and all the wood laid in heaps.\" So\nthe little earth-men went about and got together the whole of their\nkindred to help them with the work. They began at once, and when the\nthree hours were over, all was done, and they came back to the king's\ndaughter and told her so.  Then she took her white handkerchief again\nand said, \"Earth-workers, go home.\" At this they all disappeared.\n\nWhen the king's son awoke, he was delighted, and she said, \"Come home\nwhen it has struck six o'clock.\" He did as she told him, and then the\nking asked, \"Have you made away with the forest?\" \"Yes,\" said the\nking's son.  When they were sitting at table, the king said, \"I\ncannot yet give you my daughter to wife, you must still do something\nmore for her sake.\" So he asked what it was to be.  \"I have a great\nfish-pond,\" said the king.  \"You must go to it to-morrow morning and\nclear it of all mud until it is as bright as a mirror, and fill it\nwith every kind of fish.\"\n\nThe next morning the king gave him a glass shovel and said, \"The\nfish-pond must be done by six o'clock.\" So he went away, and when he\ncame to the fish-pond he stuck his shovel in the mud and it broke in\ntwo.  Then he stuck his hoe in the mud, and it broke also.  Then he\nwas much troubled.  At noon the youngest daughter brought him\nsomething to eat, and asked him how he was getting on.  So the king's\nson said everything was going very ill with him, and he would\ncertainly have to lose his head.  \"My tools have broken to pieces\nagain.\" \"Oh,\" said she, \"you must just come and eat something, and\nthen you will be in another frame of mind.\" \"No,\" said he, \"I cannot\neat, I am far too unhappy for that.\" Then she gave him many good\nwords until at last he came and ate something.\n\nThen she loused him again, and he fell asleep, so once more she took\nher handkerchief, tied a knot in it, and struck the ground thrice\nwith the knot, and said, \"Earth-workers, come forth.\" In a moment a\ngreat many little earth-men came and asked what she desired, and she\ntold them that in three hours, time, they must have the fish-pond\nentirely cleaned out, and it must be so clear that people could see\nthemselves reflected in it, and every kind of fish must be in it.\nThe little earth-men went away and summoned all their kindred to help\nthem, and in two hours it was done.  Then they returned to her and\nsaid, \"We have done as you have commanded.\" The king's daughter took\nthe handkerchief and once more struck thrice on the ground with it,\nand said, \"earth-workers, go home again.\" Then they all went away.\n\nWhen the king's son awoke the fish-pond was done.  Then the king's\ndaughter went away also, and told him that when it was six he was to\ncome to the house.  When he arrived at the house the king asked,\n\"Have you got the fish-pond done?\" \"Yes,\" said the king's son.  That\nwas very good.\n\nWhen they were again sitting at table the king said, \"You have\ncertainly done the fish-pond, but I cannot give you my daughter yet,\nyou must just do one thing more.\" \"What is that, then?\" asked the\nking's son.  The king said he had a great mountain on which there was\nnothing but briars which must all be cut down, and at the top of it\nthe youth must build a great castle, which must be as strong as could\nbe conceived, and all the furniture and fittings belonging to a\ncastle must be inside it.\n\nAnd when he arose next morning the king gave him a glass axe and a\nglass gimlet, and he was to have all done by six o'clock.  As he was\ncutting down the first briar with the axe, it broke off short, and so\nsmall that the pieces flew all round about, and he could not use the\ngimlet either.  Then he was quite miserable, and waited for his\ndearest to see if she would not come and help him in his need.  When\nit was mid-day she came and brought him something to eat.  He went to\nmeet her and told her all, and ate something, and let her louse him\nand fell asleep.\n\nThen she once more took the knot and struck the earth with it, and\nsaid, \"Earth-workers, come forth.\" Then came once again numbers of\nearth-men, and asked what her desire was.  Then said she, \"In the\nspace of three hours you must cut down the whole of the briars, and a\ncastle must be built on the top of the mountain that must be as\nstrong as any one could conceive, and all the furniture that pertains\nto a castle must be inside it.\" They went away, and summoned their\nkindred to help them and when the time was come, all was ready.  Then\nthey came to the king's daughter and told her so, and the king's\ndaughter took her handkerchief and struck thrice on the earth with\nit, and said, \"Earth-workers, go home, on which they all\ndisappeared.\" When therefore the king's son awoke and saw everything\ndone, he was as happy as a bird in air.\n\nWhen it had struck six, they went home together.  Then said the king,\n\"Is the castle ready?\" \"Yes,\" said the king's son.  When they sat\ndown to table, the king said, \"I cannot give away my youngest\ndaughter until the two eldest are married.\" Then the king's son and\nthe king's daughter were quite troubled, and the king's son had no\nidea what to do.  But he went by night to the king's daughter and ran\naway with her.  When they had got a little distance away, the king's\ndaughter peeped round and saw her father behind her.  \"Oh,\" said she,\n\"what are we to do? My father is behind us, and will take us back\nwith him.  I will at once change you into a briar, and myself into a\nrose, and I will shelter myself in the midst of the bush.\"\n\nWhen the father reached the place, there stood a briar with one rose\non it, and he was about to gather the rose, when the thorn pricked\nhis finger so that he was forced to go home again.  His wife asked\nwhy he had not brought their daughter back with him.  So he said he\nhad nearly got up to her, but that all at once he had lost sight of\nher, and a briar with one rose was growing on the spot. Then said the\nqueen, \"If you had but gathered the rose, the briar would have been\nforced to come too.\" So he went back again to fetch the rose, but in\nthe meantime the two were already far over the plain, and the king\nran after them.  Then the daughter once more looked round and saw her\nfather coming, and said, \"Oh, what shall we do now?  I will instantly\nchange you into a church and myself into a priest, and I will stand\nup in the pulpit, and preach.\" When the king got to the place, there\nstood a church, and in the pulpit was a priest preaching.  So he\nlistened to the sermon, and then went home again.\n\nThen the queen asked why he had not brought their daughter with him,\nand he said, \"Nay, I ran a long time after her, and just as I thought\nI should soon overtake her, a church was standing there and a priest\nwas in the pulpit preaching.\" \"You should just have brought the\npriest,\" said his wife, \"and then the church would soon have come.\nIt is no use to send you, I must go there myself.\" When she had\nwalked for some time, and could see the two in the distance, the\nking's daughter peeped round and saw her mother coming, and said,\n\"Now we are undone, for my mother is coming herself, I will\nimmediately change you into a fish-pond and myself into a fish.\"\n\nWhen the mother came to the place, there was a large fish-pond, and\nin the midst of it a fish was leaping about and peeping out of the\nwater, and it was quite merry.  She wanted to catch the fish, but she\ncould not.  Then she was very angry, and drank up the whole pond in\norder to catch the fish, but it made her so ill that she was forced\nto vomit, and vomited the whole pond out again.  Then she cried, \"I\nsee very well that nothing can be done now, and asked them to come\nback to her.\" Then the king's daughter went back again, and the queen\ngave her daughter three walnuts, and said, \"With these you can help\nyourself when you are in your greatest need.\"\n\nSo the young folks once more went away together.  And when they had\nwalked quite ten miles, they arrived at the castle from whence the\nking's son came, and near it was a village.  When they reached it,\nthe king's son said, \"Stay here, my dearest, I will just go to the\ncastle, and then will I come with a carriage and with attendants to\nfetch you.\"\n\nWhen he got to the castle they all rejoiced greatly at having the\nking's son back again, and he told them he had a bride who was now in\nthe village, and they must go with the carriage to fetch her.  Then\nthey harnessed the horses at once, and many attendants seated\nthemselves outside the carriage.  When the king's son was about to\nget in, his mother gave him a kiss, and he forgot everything which\nhad happened, and also what he was about to do. At this his mother\nordered the horses to be taken out of the carriage again, and\neveryone went back into the house.  But the maiden sat in the village\nand watched and watched, and thought he would come and fetch her, but\nno one came.  Then the king's daughter took service in the mill which\nbelonged to the castle, and was obliged to sit by the pond every\nafternoon and clean the tubs.\n\nAnd the queen came one day on foot from the castle, and went walking\nby the pond, and saw the well-grown maiden sitting there, and said,\n\"What a fine strong girl that is.  She pleases me well.\" Then she and\nall with her looked at the maid, but no one knew her.  So a long time\npassed by during which the maiden served the miller honorably and\nfaithfully.  In the meantime, the queen had sought a wife for her\nson, who came from quite a distant part of the world.  When the bride\ncame, they were at once to be married.  And many people hurried\ntogether, all of whom wanted to see everything.  Then the girl said\nto the miller that he might be so good as to give her leave to go\nalso.  So the miller said, \"Yes, do go there.\" When she was about to\ngo, she opened one of the three walnuts, and a beautiful dress lay\ninside it. She put it on, and went into the church and stood by the\naltar. Suddenly came the bride and bridegroom, and seated themselves\nbefore the altar, and when the priest was just going to bless them,\nthe bride peeped half round and saw the maiden standing there.  Then\nshe stood up again, and said she would not be given away until she\nalso had as beautiful a dress as that lady there.\n\nSo they went back to the house again, and sent to ask the lady if she\nwould sell that dress.  No, she would not sell it, but the bride\nmight perhaps earn it.  Then the bride asked her how she was to do\nthis.  Then the maiden said if she might sleep one night outside the\nking's son's door, the bride might have what she wanted.  So the\nbride said, \"Yes,\" she was willing to do that.  But the servants were\nordered to give the king's son a sleeping draught, and then the\nmaiden laid herself down on the threshold and lamented all night\nlong.  She had had the forest cut down for him, she had had the\nfish-pond cleaned out for him, she had had the castle built for him,\nshe had changed him into a briar, and then into a church, and at last\ninto a fish-pond, and yet he had forgotten her so quickly.\n\nThe king's son did not hear one word of it, but the servants had been\nawakened, and had listened to it, and had not known what it could\nmean.  The next morning when they were all up, the bride put on the\ndress, and went away to the church with the bridegroom.  In the\nmeantime the maiden opened the second walnut, and a still more\nbeautiful dress was inside it.  She put it on, and went and stood by\nthe altar in the church, and everything happened as it had happened\nthe time before.  And the maiden again lay all night on the threshold\nwhich led to the chamber of the king's son, and the servant was once\nmore to give him a sleeping draught.  The servant, however, went to\nhim and gave him something to keep him awake, and then the king's son\nwent to bed, and the miller's maiden bemoaned herself as before on\nthe threshold of the door, and told of all that she had done.  All\nthis the king's son heard, and was sore troubled, and what was past\ncame back to him.  Then he wanted to go to her, but his mother had\nlocked the door.\n\nThe next morning, however, he went at once to his beloved, and told\nher everything which had happened to him, and prayed her not to be\nangry with him for having forgotten her.  Then the king's daughter\nopened the third walnut, and within it was a still more magnificent\ndress, which she put on, and went with her bridegroom to church, and\nnumbers of children came who gave them flowers, and offered them gay\nribbons to bind about their feet, and they were blessed by the\npriest, and had a merry wedding.  But the false mother and the bride\nhad to depart.  And the mouth of the person who last told all this is\nstill warm.\n", "The Cunning Little Tailor": "There was once upon a time a princess who was extremely proud. If a\nwooer came she gave him some riddle to guess, and if he could not\nguess it, he was sent contemptuously away.  She let it be made known\nalso that whosoever solved her riddle should marry her, let him be\nwho he might.  At length, three tailors fell in with each other, the\ntwo eldest of whom thought they had done so many dexterous jobs of\nwork successfully that they could not fail to succeed in this also,\nthe third was a little, useless harum-scarum, who did not even know\nhis trade, but thought he must have some luck in this venture, for\nwhere else was it to come from.  Then the two others said to him,\njust stay at home, you cannot do much with your little understanding.\nThe little tailor, however, did not let himself be discouraged, and\nsaid he had set his mind to work on this for once, and he would\nmanage well enough, and he went forth as if the whole world were his.\n\nThey all three announced themselves to the princess, and said she was\nto propound her riddle to them, and that the right persons were now\ncome, who had understandings so fine that they could be threaded in a\nneedle.  Then said the princess, \"I have two kinds of hair on my\nhead, of what color is it.\" \"If that be all,\" said the first, \"it\nmust be black and white, like the cloth which is called pepper and\nsalt.\" The princess said, \"Wrongly guessed, let the second answer.\"\nThen said the second, \"If it be not black and white, then it is brown\nand red, like my father's sunday coat.\" \"Wrongly guessed,\" said the\nprincess, \"let the third give the answer for I see very well he knows\nit for certain.\" Then the little tailor stepped boldly forth and\nsaid, \"The princess has a silver and a golden hair on her head, and\nthose are the two different colors.\"\n\nWhen the princess heard that, she turned pale and nearly fell down\nwith terror, for the little tailor had guessed her riddle, and she\nhad firmly believed that no man on earth could discover it.  When her\ncourage returned she said, \"You have not won me yet by that.  There\nis still something else that you must do.  Below, in the stable is a\nbear with which you shall pass the night, and when I get up in the\nmorning if you are still alive, you shall marry me.\" She expected,\nhowever, she would thus get rid of the tailor, for the bear had never\nyet left anyone alive who had fallen into his clutches.  The little\ntailor did not let himself be frightened away, but was quite\ndelighted, and said, \"Boldly ventured is half won.\"\n\nSo when the evening came, our little tailor was taken down to the\nbear.  The bear was about to set on the little fellow at once, and\ngive him a hearty welcome with his paws.  \"Softly, softly,\" said the\nlittle tailor, \"I will soon make you quiet.\" Then quite composedly,\nand as if he had no anxiety in the world, he took some nuts out of\nhis pocket, cracked them, and ate the kernels.  When the bear saw\nthat, he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too.  The tailor\nfelt in his pockets, and reached him a handful, they were, however,\nnot nuts, but pebbles.  The bear put them in his mouth, but could get\nnothing out of them, let him bite as he would.  \"Eh,\" thought he,\n\"what a stupid blockhead am I, I cannot even crack a nut.\" And then\nhe said to the tailor, \"Here, crack me the nuts.\" \"There, see what a\nstupid fellow you are,\" said the little tailor, \"to have such a great\nmouth, and not be able to crack a small nut.\" Then he took the pebble\nand nimbly put a nut in his mouth in the place of it, and crack, it\nwas in two.  \"I must try the thing again,\" said the bear, \"when I\nwatch you, I then think I ought to be able to do it too.\" So the\ntailor once more gave him a pebble, and the bear tried and tried to\nbite into it with all the strength of his body.  But even you do not\nbelieve that he managed it.\n\nWhen that was over, the tailor took out a violin from beneath his\ncoat, and played something to himself.  When the bear heard the\nmusic, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a\nwhile, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little\ntailor, \"Listen, is it difficult to fiddle?\" \"Easy enough for a\nchild.  Look, with the left hand I lay my fingers on it, and with the\nright I stroke it with the bow, and then it goes merrily, hop sa sa\nvivallalera.\" \"So,\" said the bear, \"fiddling is a thing I should like\nto learn too, that I might dance whenever I felt like it.  What do\nyou think of that?  Will you give me lessons?\" \"With all my heart,\"\nsaid the tailor, \"if you have a talent for it.  But just let me see\nyour claws, they are terribly long, I must cut your nails a little.\"\nThen a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the\nlittle tailor screwed it tight, and said, \"Now wait until I come with\nthe scissors.\" And he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in\nthe corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep.\n\nWhen the princess heard the bear growling so fiercely during the\nnight, she believed nothing else but that he was growling for joy,\nand had made an end of the tailor.  In the morning she arose careless\nand happy, but when she peeped into the stable, the tailor stood\ngaily before her, and was as healthy as a fish in water.  Now she\ncould not say another word against the wedding because she had given\na promise before everyone, and the king ordered a carriage to be\nbrought in which she was to drive to church with the tailor, and\nthere she was to be married.\n\nWhen they had climbed into the carriage, the two other tailors, who\nhad false hearts and envied him his good fortune, went into the\nstable and unscrewed the bear again.  The bear in great fury ran\nafter the carriage.  The princess heard snorting and growling.  She\nwas terrified, and she cried, \"Ah, the bear is behind us and wants to\nget you.\" The tailor was quick and stood on his head, stuck his legs\nout of the window, and cried, \"Do you see the vise?  If you do not be\noff you shall be put into it again.\" When the bear saw that, he\nturned round and ran away.  The tailor drove quietly to church, and\nthe princess was married to him at once, and he lived with her as\nhappy as a woodlark.  Whosoever does not believe this, must pay a\ntaler.\n", "The Bright Sun Brings It to Light": "A tailor's apprentice was traveling about the world in search of\nwork, and at one time he could find none, and his poverty was so\ngreat that he had not a farthing to live on.  Presently he met a Jew\non the road, and as he thought he would have a great deal of money\nabout him, the tailor thrust God out of his heart, fell on the Jew,\nand said, give me your money, or I will strike you dead.  Then said\nthe Jew, grant me my life, I have no money but eight farthings.  But\nthe tailor said, money you have, and it shall be produced, and used\nviolence and beat him until he was near death.  And when the Jew was\ndying, the last words he said were, the bright sun will bring it to\nlight, and thereupon he died.  The tailor's apprentice felt in his\npockets and sought for money, but he found nothing but eight\nfarthings, as the Jew had said.  Then he took him up and carried him\nbehind a clump of trees, and went onwards to seek work.  After he had\ntraveled about a long while, he found work in a town with a master\nwho had a pretty daughter, with whom he fell in love, and he married\nher, and lived in good and happy wedlock.\n\nAfter a long time when he and his wife had two children, the wife's\nfather and mother died, and the young people kept house alone.  One\nmorning, when the husband was sitting on the table before the window,\nhis wife brought him his coffee, and when he had poured it out into\nthe saucer, and was just going to drink, the sun shone on it and the\nreflection gleamed hither and thither on the wall above, and made\ncircles on it.  Then the tailor looked up and said, yes, it would\nlike very much to bring it to light, and cannot.  The woman said, o,\ndear husband, and what is that, then.  What do you mean by that.  He\nanswered, I must not tell you.  But she said, if you love me, you\nmust tell me, and used her most affectionate words, and said that no\none should ever know it, and left him no rest.  Then he told her how\nyears ago, when he was traveling about seeking work and quite worn\nout and penniless, he had killed a Jew, and that in the last agonies\nof death, the Jew had spoken the words, the bright sun will bring it\nto light.  And now, the sun had just wanted to bring it to light, and\nhad gleamed and made circles on the wall, but had not been able to do\nit.  After this, he again charged her particularly never to tell\nthis, or he would lose his life, and she did promise.  However, when\nhe had sat down to work again, she went to her great friend and\nconfided the story to her, and asked her never to repeat it to any\nhuman being, but before three days were over, the whole town knew it,\nand the tailor was brought to trial, and condemned.  And thus, after\nall, the bright sun did bring it to light.\n", "The Wilful Child": "Once upon a time there was a child who was willful, and would not do\nwhat her mother wished.  For this reason God had no pleasure in her,\nand let her become ill, and no doctor could do her any good, and in a\nshort time she lay on her death-bed. When she had been lowered into\nher grave, and the earth was spread over her, all at once her arm\ncame out again, and stretched upwards, and when they had put it in\nand spread fresh earth over it, it was all to no purpose, for the arm\nalways came out again.  Then the mother herself was obliged to go to\nthe grave, and strike the arm with a rod, and when she had done that,\nit was drawn in, and then at last the child had rest beneath the\nground.\n", "The King's Son Who Feared Nothing": "There was once a king's son, who was no longer content to stay at\nhome in his father's house, and as he had no fear of anything, he\nthought, I will go forth into the wide world, there the time will not\nseem long to me, and I shall see wonders enough.  So he took leave of\nhis parents, and went forth, and on and on from morning till night,\nand whichever way his path led it was the same to him.  It came to\npass that he arrived at the house of a giant, and as he was so tired\nhe sat down by the door and rested. And as he let his eyes roam here\nand there, he saw the giant's playthings lying in the yard.  These\nwere a couple of enormous balls, and nine-pins as tall as a man.\nAfter a while he had a fancy to set the nine-pins up and then rolled\nthe balls at them, and screamed and cried out when the nine-pins\nfell, and had a merry time of it.\n\nThe giant heard the noise, stretched his head out of the window, and\nsaw a man who was not taller than other men, and yet played with his\nnine-pins.  \"Little worm,\" cried he, \"why are you playing with my\nballs?  Who gave you strength to do it?\" The king's son looked up,\nsaw the giant, and said, \"Oh, you blockhead, you think indeed that\nyou only have strong arms, I can do everything I want to do.\" The\ngiant came down and watched the bowling with great admiration, and\nsaid, \"Child of man, if you are one of that kind, go and bring me an\napple of the tree of life.\" \"What do you want with it?\" said the\nking's son.  \"I do not want the apple for myself,\" answered the\ngiant, \"but I have a betrothed bride who wishes for it.  I have\ntraveled far about the world and cannot find the tree.\" \"I will soon\nfind it,\" said the king's son, \"and I do not know what is to prevent\nme from getting the apple down.\" The giant said, \"You really believe\nit to be so easy.  The garden in which the tree stands is surrounded\nby an iron railing, and in front of the railing lie wild beasts, each\nclose to the other, and they keep watch and let no man go in.\" \"They\nwill be sure to let me in,\" said the king's son.  \"Yes, but even if\nyou do get into the garden, and see the apple hanging to the tree, it\nis still not yours.  A ring hangs in front of it, through which any\none who wants to reach the apple and break it off, must put his hand,\nand no one has yet had the luck to do it.\" \"That luck will be mine,\"\nsaid the king's son. Then he took leave of the giant, and went forth\nover mountain and valley, and through plains and forests, until at\nlength he came to the wondrous garden.\n\nThe beasts lay round about it, but they had put their heads down and\nwere asleep.  Moreover, they did not awake when he went up to them,\nso he stepped over them, climbed the fence, and got safely into the\ngarden.  There, in the very middle of it, stood the tree of life, and\nthe red apples were shining upon the branches.  He climbed up the\ntrunk to the top, and as he was about to reach out for an apple, he\nsaw a ring hanging before it, but he thrust his hand through that\nwithout any difficulty, and picked the apple.  The ring closed\ntightly on his arm, and all at once he felt a prodigious strength\nflowing through his veins.  When he had come down again from the tree\nwith the apple, he would not climb over the fence, but grasped the\ngreat gate, and had no need to shake it more than once before it\nsprang open with a loud crash.  Then he went out, and the lion which\nhad been lying in front of the gate, was awake and sprang after him,\nnot in rage and fierceness, but following him humbly as its master.\n\nThe king's son took the giant the apple he had promised him, and\nsaid, \"You see, I have brought it without difficulty.\" The giant was\nglad that his desire had been so soon satisfied, hastened to his\nbride, and gave her the apple for which she had wished.  She was a\nbeautiful and wise maiden, and as she did not see the ring on his\narm, she said, \"I shall never believe that you have brought the\napple, until I see the ring on your arm.\" The giant said, \"I have\nnothing to do but go home and fetch it,\" and thought it would be easy\nto take away by force from the weak man, what he would not give of\nhis own free will.  He therefore demanded the ring from him, but the\nking's son refused it.  \"Where the apple is, the ring must be also,\"\nsaid the giant. \"If you will not give it of your own accord, you must\nfight me for it.\"\n\nThey wrestled with each other for a long time, but the giant could\nnot harm the king's son, who was strengthened by the magical power of\nthe ring.  Then the giant thought of a ruse, and said, \"I have got\nwarm with fighting, and so have you.  We will bathe in the river, and\ncool ourselves before we begin again.\" The king's son, who knew\nnothing of falsehood, went with him to the water, and pulled off with\nhis clothes the ring also from his arm, and sprang into the river.\nThe giant instantly snatched the ring, and ran away with it, but the\nlion, which had observed the theft, pursued the giant, tore the ring\nout of his hand, and brought it back to its master.  Then the giant\nplaced himself behind an oak-tree, and while the king's son was busy\nputting on his clothes again, surprised him, and put both his eyes\nout.\n\nAnd now the unhappy king's son stood there, and was blind and knew\nnot how to help himself.  Then the giant came back to him, took him\nby the hand as if he were someone who wanted to guide him, and led\nhim to the top of a high rock.  There he left him standing, and\nthought, \"Just two steps more, and he will fall down and kill\nhimself, and I can take the ring from him.\" But the faithful lion had\nnot deserted its master.  It held him fast by the clothes, and drew\nhim gradually back again.\n\nWhen the giant came and wanted to rob the dead man, he saw that his\ncunning had been in vain.  \"Is there no way, then, of destroying a\nweak child of man like that?\" said he angrily to himself, and seized\nthe king's son and led him back again to the precipice by another\nway, but the lion which saw his evil design, helped its master out of\ndanger here also.  When they had come close to the edge, the giant\nlet the blind man's hand drop, and was going to leave him behind\nalone, but the lion pushed the giant so that he was thrown down and\nfell, dashed to pieces, on the ground.\n\nThe faithful animal again drew its master back from the precipice,\nand guided him to a tree by which flowed a clear brook.  The king's\nson sat down there, but the lion lay down, and sprinkled the water in\nhis face with its paws.  Scarcely had a couple of drops wetted the\nsockets of his eyes, than he was once more able to see something, and\nnoticed a little bird flying quite close by, which hit itself against\nthe trunk of a tree.  So it went down to the water and bathed itself\ntherein, and then it soared upwards and swept between the trees\nwithout touching them, as if it had recovered its sight.  Then the\nking's son recognized a sign from God and stooped down to the water,\nand washed and bathed his face in it.  And when he arose he had his\neyes once more, brighter and clearer than they had ever been.\n\nThe king's son thanked God for his great mercy, and traveled with his\nlion onwards through the world.  And it came to pass that he arrived\nbefore a castle which was enchanted.  In the gateway stood a maiden\nof beautiful form and fine face, but she was quite black.  She spoke\nto him and said, \"Ah, if you could but deliver me from the evil spell\nwhich is thrown over me.\" \"What shall I do?\" said the king's son.\nThe maiden answered, \"You must pass three nights in the great hall of\nthis enchanted castle, but you must let no fear enter your heart.\nWhen they are doing their worst to torment you, if you bear it\nwithout letting a sound escape you, I shall be free.  Your life they\ndare not take.\" Then said the king's son, \"I have no fear, with God's\nhelp I will try it.\" So he went gaily into the castle, and when it\ngrew dark he seated himself in the large hall and waited.\n\nEverything was quiet, however, till midnight, when all at once a\ngreat tumult began, and out of every hole and corner came little\ndevils.  They behaved as if they did not see him, seated themselves\nin the middle of the room, lighted a fire, and began to gamble.  When\none of them lost, he said, \"It is not right, some one is here who\ndoes not belong to us, it is his fault that I am losing.\" \"Wait, you\nfellow behind the stove, I am coming,\" said another.  The screaming\nbecame still louder, so that no one could have heard it without\nterror.  The king's son stayed sitting quite calmly, and was not\nafraid, but at last the devils jumped up from the ground, and fell on\nhim, and there were so many of them that he could not defend himself\nfrom them.  They dragged him about on the floor, pinched him, pricked\nhim, beat him, and tormented him, but no sound escaped from him.\nTowards morning they disappeared, and he was so exhausted that he\ncould scarcely move his limbs, but when day dawned the black maiden\ncame to him.  She bore in her hand a little bottle wherein was the\nwater of life wherewith she washed him, and he at once felt all pain\ndepart and new strength flow through his veins.  She said, \"You have\nheld out successfully for one night, but two more lie before you.\"\nThen she went away again, and as she was going, he observed that her\nfeet had become white.\n\nThe next night the devils came and began their gambling anew.  They\nfell on the king's son, and beat him much more severely than the\nnight before, until his body was covered with wounds.  But as he bore\nall quietly, they were forced to leave him, and when dawn appeared,\nthe maiden came and healed him with the water of life.  And when she\nwent away, he saw with joy that she had already become white to the\ntips of her fingers.  And now he had only one night more to go\nthrough, but it was the worst. The devils came again, \"Are you still\nthere?\" cried they. \"You shall be tormented till your breath stops.\"\nThey pricked him and beat him, and threw him here and there, and\npulled him by the arms and legs as if they wanted to tear him to\npieces, but he bore everything, and never uttered a cry.  At last the\ndevils vanished, but he lay fainting there, and did not stir, nor\ncould he raise his eyes to look at the maiden who came in, and\nsprinkled and bathed him with the water of life.  But suddenly he was\nfreed from all pain, and felt fresh and healthy as if he had awakened\nfrom sleep, and when he opened his eyes he saw the maiden standing by\nhim, snow-white, and fair as day.\n\n\"Rise,\" said she, \"and swing your sword three times over the stairs,\nand then all will be delivered.\" And when he had done that, the whole\ncastle was released from enchantment, and the maiden was a rich\nking's daughter.  The servants came and said that the table was set\nin the great hall, and dinner served up. Then they sat down and ate\nand drank together, and in the evening the wedding was solemnized\nwith great rejoicings.\n", "Donkey Cabbages": "There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in\nwait.  He had a fresh and joyous heart, and as he was going thither,\nwhistling upon a leaf, an ugly old crone came up, who spoke to him\nand said, \"Good-day, dear huntsman, truly you are merry and\ncontented, but I am suffering from hunger and thirst, do give me an\nalms.\" The huntsman took pity on the poor old creature, felt in his\npocket, and gave her what he could afford.\n\nHe was then about to go further, but the old woman stopped him and\nsaid, \"Listen, dear huntsman, to what I tell you.  I will make you a\npresent in return for your good heart.  Go on your way now, but in a\nlittle while you will come to a tree, whereon nine birds are sitting\nwhich have a cloak in their claws, and are fighting for it, take your\ngun and shoot into the midst of them.  They will let the cloak fall\ndown to you, but one of the birds will be hurt, and will drop down\ndead.  Carry away the cloak, it is a wishing-cloak.  When you throw\nit over your shoulders, you only have to wish to be in a certain\nplace, and you will be there in the twinkling of an eye.  Take out\nthe heart of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and every morning\nearly, when you get up, you will find a gold piece under your\npillow.\" The huntsman thanked the wise woman, and thought to himself,\n\"Those are fine things that she has promised me, if all does but come\ntrue.\" And verily when he had walked about a hundred paces, he heard\nin the branches above him such a screaming and twittering that he\nlooked up and saw there a swarm of birds who were tearing a piece of\ncloth about with their beaks and claws, and tugging and fighting as\nif each wanted to have it all to himself.  \"Well,\" said the huntsman,\n\"this is amazing, it has really come to pass just as the old crone\nforetold,\" and he took the gun from his shoulder, aimed and fired\nright into the midst of them, so that the feathers flew about.  The\nbirds instantly took to flight with loud outcries, but one dropped\ndown dead, and the cloak fell at the same time.  Then the huntsman\ndid as the old woman had directed him, cut open the bird, sought the\nheart, swallowed it down, and took the cloak home with him.\n\nNext morning, when he awoke, the promise occurred to him, and he\nwished to see if it also had been fulfilled.  When he lifted up the\npillow, the gold piece shone in his eyes, and next day he found\nanother, and so it went on, every time he got up.  He gathered\ntogether a heap of gold, but at last he thought, \"Of what use is all\nmy gold to me if I stay at home?  I will go forth and see the world.\"\n\nHe then took leave of his parents, buckled on his huntsman's pouch\nand gun, and went out into the world.  It came to pass, that one day\nhe traveled through a dense forest, and when he came to the end of\nit, in the plain before him stood a fine castle.  An old woman was\nstanding with a wonderfully beautiful maiden, looking out of one of\nthe windows.  The old woman, however, was a witch and said to the\nmaiden, \"There comes one out of the forest, who has a wonderful\ntreasure in his body.  We must filch it from him, daughter of my\nheart, it is more suitable for us than for him.  He has a bird's\nheart about him, by means of which a gold piece lies every morning\nunder his pillow.\" She told her what she was to do to get it, and\nwhat part she had to play, and finally threatened her, and said with\nangry eyes, \"And if you do not attend to what I say, it will be the\nworse for you.\" Now when the huntsman came nearer he noticed the\nmaiden, and said to himself, \"I have traveled about for such a long\ntime, I will take a rest for once, and enter that beautiful castle.\nI have certainly money enough.\" Nevertheless, the real reason was\nthat he had caught sight of the beautiful picture.\n\nHe entered the house, and was well received and courteously\nentertained.  Before long he was so much in love with the young witch\nthat he no longer thought of anything else, and only saw things as\nshe saw them, and liked to do what she desired.  The old woman then\nsaid, \"Now we must have the bird's heart, he will never miss it.\" She\nbrewed a potion, and when it was ready, poured it into a goblet and\ngave it to the maiden, who was to present it to the huntsman.  She\ndid so, saying, \"Now, my dearest, drink to me.\"\n\nSo he took the goblet, and when he had swallowed the draught, he\nbrought up the heart of the bird.  The girl had to take it away\nsecretly and swallow it herself, for the old woman would have it so.\nThenceforward he found no more gold under his pillow, but it lay\ninstead under that of the maiden, from whence the old woman fetched\nit away every morning, but he was so much in love and so befooled,\nthat he thought of nothing else but of passing his time with the\ngirl.\n\nThen the old witch said, \"We have the bird's heart, but we must also\ntake the wishing-cloak away from him.\" The girl answered, \"We will\nleave him that, he has lost his wealth.\" The old woman was angry and\nsaid, \"Such a mantle is a wonderful thing, and is seldom to be found\nin this world.  I must and will have it.\" She gave the girl several\nblows, and said that if she did not obey, it should fare ill with\nher.  So she did the old woman's bidding, placed herself at the\nwindow and looked on the distant country, as if she were very\nsorrowful.  The huntsman asked, \"Why do you stand there so\nsorrowfully?\" \"Ah, my beloved,\" was her answer, \"over yonder lies the\ngarnet mountain, where the precious stones grow.  I long for them so\nmuch that when I think of them, I feel quite sad, but who can get\nthem.  Only the birds, they fly and can reach them, but a man never.\"\n\"Have you nothing else to complain of?\" said the huntsman.  \"I will\nsoon remove that burden from your heart.\" With that he drew her under\nhis mantle, wished himself on the garnet mountain, and in the\ntwinkling of an eye they were sitting on it together.  Precious\nstones were glistening on every side so that it was a joy to see\nthem, and together they gathered the finest and costliest of them.\n\nNow, the old woman had, through her sorceries, contrived that the\neyes of the huntsman should become heavy.  He said to the maiden, \"We\nwill sit down and rest awhile, I am so tired that I can no longer\nstand on my feet.\" Then they sat down, and he laid his head in her\nlap, and fell asleep. When he was asleep, she unfastened the mantle\nfrom his shoulders, and wrapped herself in it, picked up the garnets\nand stones, and wished herself back at home with them.\n\nBut when the huntsman had slept his fill and awoke, and perceived\nthat his sweetheart had betrayed him, and left him alone on the wild\nmountain, he said, \"Oh, what treachery there is in the world,\" and\nsat down there in trouble and sorrow, not knowing what to do.  But\nthe mountain belonged to some wild and monstrous giants who dwelt\nthereon and lived their lives there, and he had not sat long before\nhe saw three of them coming towards him, so he lay down as if he were\nsunk in a deep sleep.\n\nThen the giants came up, and the first kicked him with his foot and\nsaid, \"What sort of an earth-worm is this, lying here contemplating\nhis inside?\" The second said, \"Step upon him and kill him.\" But the\nthird said, contemptuously, \"That would indeed be worth your while,\njust let him live, he cannot remain here, and when he climbs higher,\ntoward the summit of of the mountain, the clouds will lay hold of him\nand bear him away.\" So saying they passed by.  But the huntsman had\npaid heed to their words, and as soon as they were gone, he rose and\nclimbed up to the summit of the mountain, and when he had sat there a\nwhile, a cloud floated towards him, caught him up, carried him away,\nand traveled about for a long time in the heavens.  Then it sank\nlower, and let itself down on a great cabbage-garden, girt round by\nwalls, so that he came softly to the ground on cabbages and\nvegetables.\n\nThen the huntsman looked about him and said, \"If I had but something\nto eat.  I am so hungry, and to proceed on my way from here will be\ndifficult.  I see here neither apples nor pears, nor any other sort\nof fruit, everywhere nothing but cabbages, but at length he thought,\nat a pinch I can eat some of the leaves, they do not taste\nparticularly good, but they will refresh me.\" With that he picked\nhimself out a fine head of cabbage, and ate it, but scarcely had he\nswallowed a couple of mouthfuls than he felt very strange and quite\ndifferent.\n\nFour legs grew on him, a thick head and two long ears, and he saw\nwith horror that he was changed into an ass.  Still as his hunger\nincreased every minute, and as the juicy leaves were suitable to his\npresent nature, he went on eating with great zest.  At last he\narrived at a different kind of cabbage, but as soon as he had\nswallowed it, he again felt a change, and resumed his former human\nshape.\n\nThen the huntsman lay down and slept off his fatigue.  When he awoke\nnext morning, he broke off one head of the bad cabbages and another\nof the good ones, and thought to himself, this shall help me to get\nmy own again and punish treachery.  Then he took the cabbages with\nhim, climbed over the wall, and went forth to look for the castle of\nhis sweetheart.  After wandering about for a couple of days he was\nlucky enough to find it again.  He dyed his face brown, so that his\nown mother would not have known him, and begged for shelter, \"I am so\ntired,\" said he, \"that I can go no further.\" The witch asked, \"Who\nare you, countryman, and what is your business?\" \"I am a king's\nmessenger, and was sent out to seek the most delicious salad which\ngrows beneath the sun.  I have even been so fortunate as to find it,\nand am carrying it about with me, but the heat of the sun is so\nintense that the delicate cabbage threatens to wither, and I do not\nknow if I can carry it any further.\"\n\nWhen the old woman heard of the exquisite salad, she was greedy, and\nsaid, \"Dear countryman, let me just try this wonderful salad.\" \"Why\nnot?\" answered he.  \"I have brought two heads with me, and will give\nyou one of them,\" and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad\ncabbage.  The witch suspected nothing amiss, and her mouth watered so\nfor this new dish that she herself went into the kitchen and dressed\nit.  When it was prepared she could not wait until it was set on the\ntable, but took a couple of leaves at once, and put them in her\nmouth, but hardly had she swallowed them than she was deprived of her\nhuman shape, and she ran out into the courtyard in the form of an\nass.\n\nPresently the maid-servant entered the kitchen, saw the salad\nstanding there ready prepared, and was about to carry it up, but on\nthe way, according to habit, she was seized by the desire to taste,\nand she ate a couple of leaves.  Instantly the magic power showed\nitself, and she likewise became an ass and ran out to the old woman,\nand the dish of salad fell to the ground.\n\nMeantime the messenger sat beside the beautiful girl, and as no one\ncame with the salad and she also was longing for it, she said, \"I\ndon't know what has become of the salad.\" The huntsman thought, the\nsalad must have already taken effect, and said, \"I will go to the\nkitchen and inquire about it.\" As he went down he saw the two asses\nrunning about in the courtyard, the salad, however, was lying on the\nground. \"All right,\" said he, \"the two have taken their portion,\" and\nhe picked up the other leaves, laid them on the dish, and carried\nthem to the maiden.  \"I bring you the delicate food myself,\" said he,\n\"in order that you may not have to wait longer.\" Then she ate of it,\nand was, like the others, immediately deprived of her human form, and\nran out into the courtyard in the shape of an ass.\n\nAfter the huntsman had washed his face, so that the transformed ones\ncould recognize him, he went down into the courtyard, and said, \"Now\nyou shall receive the wages of your treachery,\" and bound them\ntogether, all three with one rope, and drove them along until he came\nto a mill.  He knocked at the window, the miller put out his head,\nand asked what he wanted.  \"I have three unmanageable beasts,\nanswered he, which I don't want to keep any longer.  Will you take\nthem in, and give them food and stable room, and manage them as I\ntell you, and then I will pay you what you ask?\" The miller said,\n\"Why not?  But how am I to manage them?\" The huntsman then said that\nhe was to give three beatings and one meal daily to the old donkey,\nand that was the witch, one beating and three meals to the younger\none, which was the servant-girl, and to the youngest, which was the\nmaiden, no beatings and three meals, for he could not bring himself\nto have the maiden beaten. After that he went back into the castle,\nand found therein everything he needed.\n\nAfter a couple of days, the miller came and said he must inform him\nthat the old ass which had received three beatings and only one meal\ndaily was dead.  The two others, he continued, are certainly not\ndead, and are fed three times daily, but they are so sad that they\ncannot last much longer.  The huntsman was moved to pity, put away\nhis anger, and told the miller to drive them back again to him.  And\nwhen they came, he gave them some of the good salad, so that they\nbecame human again.  The beautiful girl fell on her knees before him,\nand said, \"Ah, my beloved, forgive me for the evil I have done you,\nmy mother drove me to it.  It was done against my will, for I love\nyou dearly.  Your wishing-cloak hangs in a cupboard, and as for the\nbird's-heart I will take a vomiting potion.\" But he thought\notherwise, and said, \"Keep it.  It is all the same, for I will take\nyou for my true wife.\" So the wedding was celebrated, and they lived\nhappily together until their death.\n", "The Old Woman in the Wood": "A poor servant-girl was once traveling with the family with which she\nwas in service, through a great forest, and when they were in the\nmidst of it, robbers came out of the thicket, and murdered all they\nfound.  All perished together except the girl, who had jumped out of\nthe carriage in a fright, and hidden herself behind a tree.  When the\nrobbers had gone away with their booty, she came out and beheld the\ngreat disaster.  Then she began to weep bitterly, and said, \"What can\na poor girl like me do now?  I do not know how to get out of the\nforest, no human being lives in it, so I must certainly starve.\"\n\nShe walked about and looked for a road, but could find none.  When it\nwas evening she seated herself under a tree, gave herself into God's\nkeeping, and resolved to sit waiting there and not go away, let\nhappen what might.  When she had sat there for a while, a white dove\ncame flying to her with a little golden key in its beak.  It put the\nlittle key in her hand, and said, \"Do you see that great tree,\ntherein is a little lock, open it with the tiny key, and you will\nfind food enough, and suffer no more hunger.\"\n\nThen she went to the tree and opened it, and found milk in a little\ndish, and white bread to break into it, so that she could eat her\nfill.  When she was satisfied, she said, \"It is now the time when the\nhens at home go to roost, I am so tired I could go to bed too.\" Then\nthe dove flew to her again, and brought another golden key in its\nbill, and said, \"Open that tree there, and you will find a bed.\" So\nshe opened it, and found a beautiful white bed, and she prayed God to\nprotect her during the night, and lay down and slept.\n\nIn the morning the dove came for the third time, and again brought a\nlittle key, and said, \"Open that tree there, and you will find\nclothes.\" And when she opened it, she found garments beset with gold\nand with jewels, more splendid than those of any king's daughter.  So\nshe lived there for some time, and the dove came every day and\nprovided her with all she needed, and it was a quiet good life.\n\nThen one day the dove came and said, \"Will you do something for my\nsake?\" \"With all my heart,\" said the girl.  Then said the little\ndove, \"I will guide you to a small house, enter it and inside it, an\nold woman will be sitting by the fire and will say, 'good-day.' But\non your life give her no answer, let her do what she will, but pass\nby her on the right side. Further on, there is a door, which open,\nand you will enter into a room where a quantity of rings of all kinds\nare lying, amongst which are some magnificent ones with shining\nstones.  Leave them, however, where they are, and seek out a plain\none, which must likewise be amongst them, and bring it here to me as\nquickly as you can.\"\n\nThe girl went to the little house, and came to the door.  There sat\nan old woman who stared when she saw her, and said, \"Good-day my\nchild.\" The girl gave her no answer, and opened the door.  \"Whither\naway?\" cried the old woman, and seized her by the gown, and wanted to\nhold her fast, saying, \"That is my house, no one can go in there if I\nchoose not to allow it.\" But the girl was silent, got away from her,\nand went straight into the room.\n\nNow there lay on the table an enormous quantity of rings, which\ngleamed and glittered before her eyes.  She turned them over and\nlooked for the plain one, but could not find it.  While she was\nseeking, she saw the old woman and how she was stealing away, and\nwanting to go off with a bird-cage which she had in her hand.  So she\nwent after her and took the cage out of her hand, and when she raised\nit up and looked into it, a bird was inside which had the plain ring\nin its bill.\n\nThen she took the ring, and ran quite joyously home with it, and\nthought the little white dove would come and get the ring, but it did\nnot.  Then she leant against a tree, determined to wait for the dove.\nAs she thus stood, it seemed just as if the tree was soft and pliant,\nand was letting its branches down.  And suddenly the branches twined\naround her, and were two arms, and when she looked around, the tree\nwas a handsome man, who embraced and kissed her heartily, and said,\n\"You have delivered me from the power of the old woman, who is a\nwicked witch.  She had changed me into a tree, and every day for two\nhours I was a white dove, and so long as she possessed the ring I\ncould not regain my human form.\" Then his servants and his horses,\nwho had likewise been changed into trees, were freed from the\nenchanter also, and stood beside him.  And he led them forth to his\nkingdom, for he was a king's son, and they married, and lived\nhappily.\n", "The Three Brothers": "There was once a man who had three sons, and nothing else in the\nworld but the house in which he lived.  Now each of the sons wished\nto have the house after his father's death, but the father loved them\nall alike, and did not know what to do, he did not wish to sell the\nhouse, because it had belonged to his forefathers, else he might have\ndivided the money amongst them. At last he conceived a plan, and he\nsaid to his sons, \"Go into the world, and try each of you to learn a\ntrade, and, when you all come back, he who makes the best masterpiece\nshall have the house.\"\n\nThe sons were well content with this, and the eldest determined to be\na blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master.\nThey fixed a time when they should all come home again, and then each\nwent his way.\n\nIt chanced that they all found skillful masters, who taught them\ntheir trades well.  The blacksmith had to shoe the king's horses, and\nhe thought to himself, \"The house is mine, without doubt.\" The barber\nshaved only distinguished people, and he too already looked upon the\nhouse as his own.  The fencing-master suffered many a blow, but he\ngrit his teeth, and let nothing vex him, for, said he to himself, \"If\nyou are afraid of a blow, you'll never win the house.\"\n\nWhen the appointed time had gone by, the three brothers came back\nhome to their father, but they did not know how to find the best\nopportunity for showing their skill, so they sat down and consulted\ntogether.  As they were sitting thus, all at once a hare came running\nacross the field.  Ah, ha, just in time, said the barber.  So he took\nhis basin and soap, and lathered away until the hare drew near, then\nhe soaped and shaved off the hare's whiskers whilst he was running at\nthe top of his speed, and did not even cut his skin or injure a hair\non his body. \"Well done,\" said the old man. \"If the others do not\nmake a great effort, the house is yours.\"\n\nSoon after, up came a nobleman in his coach, dashing along at full\nspeed.  \"Now you shall see what I can do, father,\" said the\nblacksmith.  So away he ran after the coach, took all four shoes off\nthe feet of one of the horses whilst he was galloping, and put on\nfour new shoes without stopping him.  \"You are a fine fellow, and as\nclever as your brother,\" said his father.  \"I do not know to which I\nought to give the house.\"\n\nThen the third son said, \"Father, let me have my turn, if you\nplease,\" and, as it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword, and\nflourished it backwards and forwards above his head so fast that not\na drop fell upon him.  It rained still harder and harder, till at\nlast it came down in torrents, but he only flourished his sword\nfaster and faster, and remained as dry as if he were sitting in a\nhouse.  When his father saw this he was amazed, and said, \"This is\nthe masterpiece, the house is yours.\"\n\nHis brothers were satisfied with this, as was agreed beforehand, and,\nas they loved one another very much, they all three stayed together\nin the house, followed their trades, and, as they had learnt them so\nwell and were so clever, they earned a great deal of money.  Thus\nthey lived together happily until they grew old, and at last, when\none of them fell sick and died, the two others grieved so sorely\nabout it that they also fell ill, and soon after died.  And because\nthey had been so clever, and had loved one another so much, they were\nall laid in the same grave.\n", "The Devil and His Grandmother": "There was a great war, and the king had many soldiers, but gave them\nsmall pay, so small that they could not live upon it, so three of\nthem agreed among themselves to desert.  One of them said to the\nothers, \"If we are caught we shall be hanged on the gallows, how\nshall we manage it?\" Another said, \"Look at that great cornfield, if\nwe were to hide ourselves there, no one could find us, the troops are\nnot allowed to enter it, and to-morrow they are to march away.\" They\ncrept into the corn, only the troops did not march away, but remained\nlying all round about it.  They stayed in the corn for two days and\ntwo nights, and were so hungry that they all but died, but if they\nhad come out, their death would have been certain.  Then said they,\n\"What is the use of our deserting if we have to perish miserably\nhere?\"\n\nBut now a fiery dragon came flying through the air, and it came down\nto them, and asked why they had concealed themselves there.  They\nanswered, \"We are three soldiers who have deserted because the pay\nwas so bad, and now we shall have to die of hunger if we stay here,\nor to dangle on the gallows if we go out.\" \"If you will serve me for\nseven years,\" said the dragon, \"I will convey you through the army so\nthat no one shall seize you.\" \"We have no choice and are compelled to\naccept,\" they replied.  Then the dragon caught hold of them with his\nclaws, and carried them away through the air over the army, and put\nthem down again on the earth far from it, but the dragon was no other\nthan the devil.  He gave them a small whip and said, \"Whip with it\nand crack it, and then as much gold will spring up round about as you\ncan wish for, then you can live like great lords, keep horses, and\ndrive your carriages, but when the seven years have come to an end,\nyou are my property.\"\n\nThen he put before them a book which they were all three forced to\nsign.  \"But first I will ask you a riddle,\" said he, \"and if you can\nguess it, you shall be free, and released from my power.\" Then the\ndragon flew away from them, and they went away with their whip, had\ngold in plenty, ordered themselves rich apparel, and traveled about\nthe world.  Wherever they were they lived in pleasure and\nmagnificence, rode on horseback, drove in carriages, ate and drank,\nbut did nothing wicked.  The time slipped quickly by, and when the\nseven years were coming to an end, two of them were terribly anxious\nand alarmed, but the third took the affair easily, and said,\n\"Brothers, fear nothing, I still have my wits about me, I shall guess\nthe riddle.\" They went out into the open country and sat down, and\nthe two pulled sorrowful faces.  Then an aged woman came up to them\nwho inquired why they were so sad. \"Well,\" said they, \"what has that\ngot to do with you?  After all, you cannot help us.\" \"Who knows?\"\nsaid she. \"Just confide your trouble to me.\" So they told her that\nthey had been the devil's servants for nearly seven years, and that\nhe had provided them with gold as though it were hay, but that they\nhad sold themselves to him, and were forfeited to him, if at the end\nof the seven years they could not guess a riddle.\n\nThe old woman said, \"If you are to be saved, one of you must go into\nthe forest, there he will come to a fallen rock which looks like a\nlittle house, he must enter that, and then he will obtain help.\" The\ntwo melancholy ones thought to themselves, \"That will still not save\nus,\" and stayed where they were, but the third, the merry one, got up\nand walked on in the forest until he found the rockhouse.  In the\nlittle house a very aged woman was sitting, who was the devil's\ngrandmother, and asked the soldier where he came from, and what he\nwanted there.  He told her everything that had happened, and as he\npleased her well, she had pity on him, and said she would help him.\nShe lifted up a great stone which lay above a cellar, and said,\n\"Conceal yourself there, you can hear everything that is said here,\nonly sit still, and do not stir.  When the dragon comes, I will\nquestion him about the riddle, he tells everything to me, so listen\ncarefully to his answer.\"\n\nAt twelve o'clock at night, the dragon came flying thither, and asked\nfor his dinner.  The grandmother laid the table, and served up food\nand drink, so that he was pleased, and they ate and drank together.\nIn the course of conversation, she asked him what kind of a day he\nhad had, and how many souls he had got.  \"Nothing went very well\nto-day,\" he answered, \"but I have laid hold of three soldiers, I have\nthem safe.\" \"Indeed? Three soldiers, they're clever, they may escape\nyou yet.\" The devil said mockingly, \"They are mine.  I will set them\na riddle, which they will never be able to guess.\" \"What riddle is\nthat?\" she inquired. \"I will tell you, in the great north sea lies a\ndead dogfish, that shall be your roast meat, and the rib of a whale\nshall be your silver spoon, and a hollow old horse's hoof shall be\nyour wineglass.\"\n\nWhen the devil had gone to bed, the old grandmother raised up the\nstone, and let out the soldier.  \"Did you give heed to everything?\"\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I know enough, and will save myself.\" Then he had to\ngo back another way, through the window, secretly and with all speed\nto his companions.  He told them how the devil had been outwitted by\nthe old grandmother, and how he had learned the answer to the riddle\nfrom him.  Then they were all delighted, and of good cheer, and took\nthe whip and whipped so much gold for themselves that it ran all over\nthe ground.\n\nWhen the seven years had fully gone by, the devil came with the book,\nshowed the signatures, and said, \"I will take you with me to hell.\nThere you shall have a meal.  If you can guess what kind of roast\nmeat you will have to eat, you shall be free and released from your\nbargain, and may keep the whip as well.\" Then the first soldier began\nand said, \"In the great north sea lies a dead dogfish, that no doubt\nis the roast meat.\"\n\nThe devil was angry, and began to mutter, \"Hm. Hm. Hm.\" And asked the\nsecond, \"But what will your spoon be?\" \"The rib of a whale, that is\nto be our silver spoon.\" The devil made a wry face, again growled,\n\"Hm. Hm. Hm.\" He said to the third, \"And do you also know what your\nwineglass is to be?\" \"An old horse's hoof is to be our wineglass.\"\nThen the devil flew away with a loud cry, and had no more power over\nthem, but the three kept the whip, whipped as much money for\nthemselves with it as they wanted, and lived happily to their end.\n\n", "Ferdinand the Faithful": "Once upon a time lived a man and a woman who so long as they were\nrich had no children, but when they were poor they got a little boy.\nThey could find no godfather for him, so the man said he would just\ngo to another village to see if he could get one there.  On his way\nhe met a poor man, who asked him where he was going.  He said he was\ngoing to see if he could get a godfather, because he was so poor that\nno one would stand as godfather for him.  \"Oh,\" said the poor man,\n\"you are poor, and I am poor.  I will be godfather for you, but I am\nso badly off I can give the child nothing.  Go home and tell the\nmidwife that she is to come to the church with the child.\" When they\nall got to the church together, the beggar was already there, and he\ngave the child the name of Ferdinand the Faithful.\n\nWhen he was going out of the church, the beggar said, \"Now go home, I\ncan give you nothing, and you likewise ought to give me nothing.\" But\nhe gave a key to the midwife, and told her when she got home she was\nto give it to the father, who was to take care of it until the child\nwas fourteen years old, and then he was to go on the heath where\nthere was a castle which the key would fit, and that all which was\ntherein should belong to him.\n\nNow when the child was seven years old and had grown very big, he\nonce went to play with some other boys, and each of them boasted that\nhe had got more from his godfather than the other, but the child\ncould say nothing, and was vexed, and went home and said to his\nfather, \"Did I get nothing at all, then, from my godfather?\" \"Oh,\nyes,\" said the father, \"you have a key.  If there is a castle\nstanding on the heath, just go to it and open it.\" Then the boy went\nthither, but no castle was to be seen, or heard of.\n\nAfter seven years more, when he was fourteen years old, he again went\nthither, and there stood the castle.  When he had opened it, there\nwas nothing within but a horse, - a white one.  Then the boy was so\nfull of joy because he had a horse, that he mounted on it and\ngalloped back to his father.  \"Now I have a white horse, and I will\ntravel,\" said he.\n\nSo he set out, and as he was on his way, a pen was lying on the road.\nAt first he thought he would pick it up, but then again he thought to\nhimself, \"You should leave it lying there, you will easily find a pen\nwhere you are going, if you have need of one.\" As he was thus riding\naway, a voice called after him, \"Ferdinand the Faithful, take it with\nyou.\" He looked around, but saw no one, so he went back again and\npicked it up.\n\nWhen he had ridden a little way farther, he passed by a lake, and a\nfish was lying on the bank, gasping and panting for breath, so he\nsaid, \"Wait, my dear fish, I will help you to get into the water,\"\nand he took hold of it by the tail, and threw it into the lake.  Then\nthe fish put its head out of the water and said, \"As you have helped\nme out of the mud I will give you a flute.  When you are in any need,\nplay on it, and then I will help you, and if ever you let anything\nfall in the water, just play and I will reach it out to you.\"\n\nThen he rode away, and there came to him a man who asked him where he\nwas going.  \"Oh, to the next place.\" \"What is your name?\" \"Ferdinand\nthe Faithful.\" \"So, then we have almost the same name, I am called\nFerdinand the Unfaithful.\" And they both set out to the inn in the\nnearest place.\n\nNow it was unfortunate that Ferdinand the Unfaithful knew everything\nthat the other had ever thought and everything he was about to do. He\nknew it by means of all kinds of wicked arts.  There was in the inn\nan honest girl, who had a bright face and behaved very prettily. She\nfell in love with Ferdinand the Faithful because he was a handsome\nman, and she asked him whither he was going.  \"Oh, I am just\ntraveling round about,\" said he.  Then she said he ought to stay\nthere, for the king of that country wanted an attendant or an\noutrider, and he ought to enter his service.  He answered he could\nnot very well go to any one like that and offer himself.  Then said\nthe maiden, \"Oh, but I will soon do that for you.\" And so she went\nstraight to the king, and told him that she knew of an excellent\nservant for him.  He was well pleased with that, and had Ferdinand\nthe Faithful brought to him, and wanted to make him his servant.  He,\nhowever, liked better to be an outrider, for where his horse was,\nthere he also wanted to be, so the king made him an outrider.\n\nWhen Ferdinand the Unfaithful learnt that, he said to the girl,\n\"What? Do you help him and not me?\" \"Oh,\" said the girl, \"I will help\nyou too.\" She thought, I must keep friends with that man, for he is\nnot to be trusted.  She went to the king, and offered him as a\nservant, and the king was willing.\n\nNow when the king met his lords in the morning, he always lamented\nand said, \"Oh, if I only had my love with me.\" Ferdinand the\nUnfaithful, however, was always hostile to Ferdinand the Faithful. So\nonce, when the king was complaining thus, he said, \"You have the\noutrider, send him away to get her, and if he does not do it, his\nhead must be struck off.\" Then the king sent for Ferdinand the\nFaithful, and told him that there was, in this place or in that\nplace, a girl he loved, and that he was to bring her to him, and if\nhe did not do it he should die.  Ferdinand the Faithful went into the\nstable to his white horse, and complained and lamented, \"Oh, what an\nunhappy man am I.\" Then someone behind him cried, \"Ferdinand the\nFaithful, why do you weep?\" He looked round but saw no one, and went\non lamenting.  \"Oh, my dear little white horse, now must I leave you,\nnow I must die.\" Then someone cried once more, \"Ferdinand the\nFaithful, why do you weep?\" Then for the first time he was aware that\nit was his little white horse who was putting that question.  \"Do you\nspeak, my little white horse?  Can you do that?\" And again, he said,\n\"I am to go to this place and to that, and am to bring the bride.\nCan you tell me how I am to set about it?\" Then answered the white\nhorse, \"Go to the king, and say if he will give you what you must\nhave, you will get her for him.  If he will give you a ship full of\nmeat, and a ship full of bread, it will succeed.  Great giants dwell\non the lake, and if you take no meat with you for them, they will\ntear you to pieces, and there are the large birds which would pluck\nthe eyes out of your head if you had no bread for them.  Then the\nking made all the butchers in the land kill, and all the bakers bake,\nthat the ships might be filled.\"\n\nWhen they were full, the little white horse said to Ferdinand the\nFaithful, \"Now mount me, and go with me into the ship, and then when\nthe giants come, say - peace, peace, my dear little giants,  I have\nhad thought of ye,  something I have brought for ye.  And when the\nbirds come, you shall again say - peace, peace, my dear little birds,\nI have had thought of ye,  something I have brought for ye.  Then\nthey will do nothing to you, and when you come to the castle, the\ngiants will help you.  Then go up to the castle, and take a couple of\ngiants with you.  There the princess lies sleeping.  You must,\nhowever, not awaken her, but the giants must lift her up, and carry\nher in her bed to the ship.\" And now everything took place as the\nlittle white horse had said, and Ferdinand the Faithful gave the\ngiants and the birds what he had brought with him for them, and that\nmade the giants willing, and they carried the princess in her bed to\nthe king.  And when she came to the king, she said she could not\nlive, she must have her writings, they had been left in her castle.\n\nThen by the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, Ferdinand the\nFaithful was called, and the king told him he must fetch the writings\nfrom the castle, or he should die.  Then he went once more into the\nstable, and bemoaned himself and said, \"Oh, my dear little white\nhorse, now I am to go away again, how am I to do it?\" Then the little\nwhite horse said he was just to load the ships full again.  So it\nhappened again as it had happened before, and the giants and the\nbirds were satisfied, and made gentle by the meat.  When they came to\nthe castle, the white horse told Ferdinand the Faithful that he must\ngo in, and that on the table in the princess's bed-room lay the\nwritings.  And Ferdinand the Faithful went in, and fetched them. When\nthey were on the lake, he let his pen fall into the water.  Then said\nthe white horse, \"Now I cannot help you at all.\" But he remembered\nhis flute, and began to play on it, and the fish came with the pen in\nits mouth, and gave it to him.  So he took the writings to the\ncastle, where the wedding was celebrated.\n\nThe queen, however, did not love the king because he had no nose, but\nshe would have much liked to love Ferdinand the Faithful.  Once,\ntherefore, when all the lords of the court were together, the queen\nsaid she could do feats of magic, that she could cut off anyone's\nhead and put it on again, and that one of them ought just to try it.\nBut none of them would be the first, so Ferdinand the Faithful, again\nat the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, undertook it and she\nhewed off his head, and put it on again for him, and it healed\ntogether directly, so that it looked as if he had a red thread round\nhis throat.  Then the king said to her, \"My child, and where have you\nlearnt that?\" \"Oh,\" she said, \"I understand the art.  Shall I just\ntry it on you also.\" \"Oh, yes,\" said he.  So she cut off his head,\nbut did not put it on again, and pretended that she could not get it\non, and that it would not stay.  Then the king was buried, but she\nmarried Ferdinand the Faithful.\n\nHe, however, always rode on his white horse, and once when he was\nseated on it, it told him that he was to go on to the heath which he\nknew, and gallop three times round it.  And when he had done that,\nthe white horse stood up on its hind legs, and was changed into a\nking's son.\n\n", "The Iron Stove": "In the days when wishing was still of some use, a king's son was\nbewitched by an old witch, and shut up in an iron stove in a forest.\nThere he passed many years, and no one could rescue him.  Then a\nking's daughter came into the forest, who had lost herself, and could\nnot find her father's kingdom again.  After she had wandered about\nfor nine days, she at length came to the iron stove.\n\nThen a voice came forth from it, and asked her, \"Whence do you come,\nand whither are you going?\" She answered, \"I have lost my father's\nkingdom, and cannot get home again.\" Then a voice inside the iron\nstove said, \"I will help you to get home again, and that indeed most\nswiftly, if you will promise to do what I desire of you.  I am the\nson of a far greater king than your father, and I will marry you.\"\n\nThen was she afraid, and thought, \"Good heavens.  What can I do with\nan iron stove?\" But as she much wished to get home to her father, she\npromised to do as he desired.  But he said, \"You shall return here,\nand bring a knife with you, and scrape a hole in the iron.\" Then he\ngave her a companion who walked near her, but did not speak, and in\ntwo hours he took her home.  There was great joy in the castle when\nthe king's daughter came home, and the old king fell on her neck and\nkissed her.  She, however, was sorely troubled, and said, \"Dear\nfather, what I have suffered.  I should never have got home again\nfrom the great wild forest, if I had not come to an iron stove, but I\nhave been forced to give my word that I will go back to it, set it\nfree, and marry it.\"\n\nThen the old king was so terrified that he all but fainted, for he\nhad but this one daughter.  They therefore resolved they would send,\nin her place, the miller's daughter, who was very beautiful.  They\ntook her there, gave her a knife, and said she was to scrape at the\niron stove.  So she scraped at it for four-and-twenty hours, but\ncould not bring off the least morsel of it.  When the day dawned, a\nvoice in the stove said, \"It seems to me it is day outside.\" Then she\nanswered, \"It seems so to me too, I fancy I hear the noise of my\nfather's mill.\" \"So you are a miller's daughter.  Then go your way at\nonce, and let the king's daughter come here.\"\n\nThen she went away at once, and told the old king that the man\noutside there would have none of her - he wanted the king's daughter.\nThen the old king grew frightened, and the daughter wept.  But there\nwas a swine-herd's daughter, who was even prettier than the miller's\ndaughter, and they determined to give her a piece of gold to go to\nthe iron stove instead of the king's daughter.  So she was taken\nthither and she also had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours.  She,\nhowever, was no better at it.  When the day broke, a voice inside the\nstove cried, \"It seems to me it is day outside.\" Then answered she,\n\"So it seems to me also, I fancy I hear my father's horn blowing.\"\n\"Then you are a swineherd's daughter.  Go away at once, and tell the\nking's daughter to come, and tell her all must be done as promised,\nand if she does not come, everything in the kingdom shall be ruined\nand destroyed, and not one stone be left standing on another.\"\n\nWhen the king's daughter heard that she began to weep, but now there\nwas nothing for it but to keep her promise.  So she took leave of her\nfather, put a knife in her pocket, and went forth to the iron stove\nin the forest.  When she got there, she began to scrape, and the iron\ngave way, and when two hours were over, she had already scraped a\nsmall hole. Then she peeped in, and saw a youth so handsome, and so\nbrilliant with gold and with precious jewels, that her very soul was\ndelighted.  So she went on scraping, and made the hole so large that\nhe was able to get out.\n\nThen said he, \"You are mine, and I am yours, you are my bride, and\nhave released me.\" He wanted to take her away with him to his\nkingdom, but she entreated him to let her go once again to her\nfather, and the king's son allowed her to do so, but she was not to\nsay more to her father than three words, and then she was to come\nback again. So she went home, but she spoke more than three words,\nand instantly the iron stove disappeared, and was taken far away over\nglass mountains and piercing swords, but the king's son was set free,\nand no longer shut up in it.  After this she bade good-bye to her\nfather, took some money with her, but not much, and went back to the\ngreat forest, and looked for the iron stove, but it was nowhere to be\nfound.\n\nFor nine days she sought it, and then her hunger grew so great that\nshe did not know what to do, for she had nothing to live on.  When it\nwas evening, she seated herself in a small tree, and made up her mind\nto spend the night there, as she was afraid of wild beasts.  When\nmidnight drew near she saw in the distance a small light, and\nthought, ah, there I should be saved.  She got down from the tree,\nand went towards the light, but on the way she prayed.  Then she came\nto a little old house, and much grass had grown all about it, and a\nsmall heap of wood lay in front of it.  She thought, \"Ah, whither\nhave I come?\" and peeped in through the window, but she saw nothing\ninside but toads, big and little, except a table covered with wine\nand roast meat, and the plates and glasses were of silver.  Then she\ntook courage, and knocked at the door, and immediately the fat toad\ncried,\n\t\"Little green waiting-maid,\n\tWaiting-maid with the limping leg,\n\tLittle dog of the limping leg,\n\tHop hither and thither,\n\tAnd quickly see who is without.\"\n\nAnd a small toad came walking by and opened the door to her. When she\nentered, they all bade her welcome, and she was forced to sit down.\nThey asked, \"Where have you come from, and whither are you going?\"\nThen she related all that had befallen her, and how because she had\ntransgressed the order which had been given her not to say more than\nthree words, the stove, and the king's son also, had disappeared, and\nnow she was about to seek him over the hill and dale until she found\nhim.  Then the old fat one said,\n\t\"Little green waiting-maid,\n\tWaiting-maid with the limping leg,\n\tLittle dog of the limping leg,\n\tHop hither and thither,\n\tAnd bring me the great box.\"\n\nThen the little one went and brought the box.  After this they gave\nher meat and drink, and took her to a well-made bed, which felt like\nsilk and velvet, and she laid herself therein, in God's name, and\nslept.  When morning came she arose, and the old toad gave her three\nneedles out of the great box which she was to take with her, they\nwould be needed by her, for she had to cross a high glass mountain,\nand go over three piercing swords and a great lake. If she did all\nthis she would get her lover back again.\n\nThen she gave her three things, which she was to take the greatest\ncare of, namely, three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts.\nWith these she traveled onwards, and when she came to the glass\nmountain which was so slippery, she stuck the three needles first\nbehind her feet and then before them, and so got over it, and when\nshe was over it, she hid them in a place which she marked carefully.\nAfter this she came to the three piercing swords, and then she seated\nherslef on her plough-wheel, and rolled over them.  At last she\narrived in front of a great lake, and when she had crossed it, she\ncame to a large and beautiful castle.  She went and asked for a\nplace, she was a poor girl, she said, and would like to be hired.\nShe knew, however, that the king's son whom she had released from the\niron stove in the great forest was in the castle.  Then she was taken\nas a scullery-maid at low wages.  But already the king's son had\nanother maiden by his side whom he wanted to marry, for he thought\nthat she had long been dead.\n\nIn the evening, when she had washed up and was done, she felt in her\npocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her.\nShe cracked one with her teeth, and was going to eat the kernel when\nlo and behold there was a stately royal garment in it.  But when the\nbride heard of this she came and asked for the dress, and wanted to\nbuy it, and said, \"It is not a dress for a servant-girl.\" \"No,\" she\nsaid, she would not sell it, but if the bride would grant her one\nthing she should have it, and that was permission to sleep one night\nin her bridegroom's chamber.  The bride gave her permission because\nthe dress was so pretty, and she had never had one like it.\n\nWhen it was evening she said to her bridegroom, \"That silly girl will\nsleep in your room.\" \"If you are willing, so am I,\" said he.  She,\nhowever, gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a\nsleeping-draught.  So the bridegroom and the scullery-maid went to\nsleep in the room, and he slept so soundly that she could not waken\nhim. She wept the whole night and cried, \"I set you free when you\nwere in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought you, and walked\nover a glass mountain, and three sharp swords, and a great lake\nbefore I found you, and yet you will not hear me.\" The servants sat\nby the chamber-door, and heard how she thus wept the whole night\nthrough, and in the morning they told it to their lord.\n\nAnd the next evening when she had washed up, she opened the second\nnut, and a far more beautiful dress was within it, and when the bride\nbeheld it, she wished to buy that also. But the girl would not take\nmoney, and begged that she might once again sleep in the bridegroom's\nchamber.  The bride, however, gave him a sleeping-draught, and he\nslept so soundly that he could hear nothing.  But the scullery-maid\nwept the whole night long, and cried, \"I set you free when you were\nin an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought you, and walked over a\nglass mountain, and over three sharp swords and a great lake before I\nfound you, and yet you will not hear me.\" The servants sat by the\nchamber-door and heard her weeping the whole night through, and in\nthe morning informed their lord of it.\n\nAnd on the third evening, when she had washed up, she opened the\nthird nut, and within it was a still more beautiful dress which was\nstiff with pure gold.  When the bride saw that she wanted to have it,\nbut the maiden only gave it up on condition that she might for the\nthird time sleep in the bridegroom's apartment.  The king's son,\nhowever, was on his guard, and threw the sleeping-draught away.  Now\nwhen she began to weep and to cry, \"Dearest love, I set you free when\nyou were in the iron stove in the terrible wild forest\" - the king's\nson leapt up and said, \"You are the true one, you are mine, and I am\nyours.\"\n\nThereupon, while it was still night, he got into a carriage with her,\nand they took away the false bride's clothes so that she could not\nget up.  When they came to the great lake, they sailed across it, and\nwhen they reached the three sharp-cutting swords they seated\nthemselves on the plough-wheel, and when they got to the glass\nmountain they thrust the three needles in it, and so at length they\ngot to the little old house, but when they went inside, it was a\ngreat castle, and the toads were all disenchanted, and were king's\nchildren, and full of happiness.  Then the wedding was celebrated,\nand the king's son and the princess remained in the castle, which was\nmuch larger than the castle of their fathers.  But as the old king\ngrieved at being left alone, they fetched him away, and brought him\nto live with them, and they had two kingdoms, and lived in happy\nwedlock.\n\tA mouse did run,\n\tThis story is done.\n", "The Four Skilful Brothers": "There was once a poor man who had four sons, and when they were grown\nup, he said to them, \"My dear children, you must now go out into the\nworld, for I have nothing to give you, so set out, go abroad and\nlearn a trade, and see how you can make your way.\" So the four\nbrothers took their sticks, bade their father farewell, and went\nthrough the town-gate together.  When they had traveled about for\nsome time, they came to a crossroads which branched off in four\ndifferent directions.  Then said the eldest, \"Here we must separate,\nbut on this day four years hence, we will meet each other again at\nthis spot, and in the meantime we will seek our fortunes.\"\n\nThen each of them went his way, and the eldest met a man who asked\nhim where he was going, and what he was intending to do. \"I want to\nlearn a trade,\" he replied.  Then the other said, \"Come with me,\" and\nbe a thief.  \"No,\" he answered, \"that is no longer regarded as a\nreputable trade, and the end of it is that one has to swing on the\ngallows.\" \"Oh,\" said the man, \"you need not be afraid of the gallows,\nI will only teach you to get such things as no other man could ever\nlay hold of, and no one will ever detect you.\" So he allowed himself\nto be talked into it, and while with the man became an accomplished\nthief, and so dexterous that nothing was safe from him, if he once\ndesired to have it.\n\nThe second brother met a man who put the same question to him - what\nhe wanted to learn in the world.  \"I don't know yet,\" he replied.\n\"Then come with me, and be an astronomer, there is nothing better\nthan that, for nothing is hid from you.\" He liked the idea, and\nbecame such a skillful astronomer that when he had learnt everything,\nand was about to travel onwards, his master gave him a telescope and\nsaid to him, \"With that you can see whatsoever takes place either on\nearth or in heaven, and nothing can remain concealed from you.\"\n\nA huntsman took the third brother into training, and gave him such\nexcellent instruction in everything which related to huntsmanship\nthat he became an experienced hunter.  When he went away, his master\ngave him a gun and said, \"It will never fail you, whatsoever you aim\nat, you are certain to hit.\" The youngest brother also met a man who\nspoke to him, and inquired what his intentions were.  \"Would you not\nlike to be a tailor?\" said he.  \"Not that I know of,\" said the youth,\n\"sitting doubled up from morning till night, driving the needle and\nthe goose backwards and forwards, is not to my taste.\" \"Oh, but you\nare speaking in ignorance,\" answered the man.  \"With me you would\nlearn a very different kind of tailoring, which is respectable and\nproper, and for the most part very honorable.\" So he let himself be\npersuaded, and went with the man, and learnt his art from the very\nbeginning.  When they parted, the man gave the youth a needle, and\nsaid, \"With this you can sew together whatever is given you, whether\nit is as soft as an egg or as hard as steel, and it will all become\none piece of stuff, so that no seam will be visible.\"\n\nWhen the appointed four years were over, the four brothers arrived at\nthe same time at the cross-roads, embraced and kissed each other, and\nreturned home to their father.  \"So now,\" said he, quite delighted,\n\"the wind has blown you back again to me.\" They told him of all that\nhad happened to them, and that each had learnt his own trade.  Now\nthey were sitting just in front of the house under a large tree, and\nthe father said, \"I will put you all to the test, and see what you\ncan do.\" Then he looked up and said to his second son, \"Between two\nbranches up at the top of this tree, there is a chaffinch's nest,\ntell me how many eggs there are in it.\" The astronomer took his\nglass, looked up and said, \"There are five.\" Then the father said to\nthe eldest, \"Fetch the eggs down without disturbing the bird which is\nsitting hatching them.\" The skillful thief climbed up, and took the\nfive eggs from beneath the bird, which never observed what he was\ndoing, and remained quietly sitting where she was, and brought them\ndown to his father.\n\nThe father took them, and put one of them on each corner of the\ntable, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, \"With\none shot you shall shoot me the five eggs in two, through the\nmiddle.\" The huntsman aimed, and shot the eggs, all five as the\nfather had desired, and that at one shot.  He certainly must have had\nsome of the powder for shooting round corners.  \"Now it's your turn,\"\nsaid the father to the fourth son, \"You shall sew the eggs together\nagain, and the young birds that are inside them as well, and you must\ndo it so that they are not hurt by the shot.\" The tailor brought his\nneedle, and sewed them as his father wished.  When he had done this\nthe thief had to climb up the tree again, and carry them to the nest,\nand put them back again under the bird without her being aware of it.\nThe bird sat her full time, and after a few days the young ones crept\nout, and they had a red line round their necks where they had been\nsewn together by the tailor.\n\n\"Well,\" said the old man to his sons, \"you really ought to be praised\nto the skies, you have used your time well, and learnt something\ngood.  I can't say which of you deserves the most praise. That will\nbe proved if you have but an early opportunity of using your\ntalents.\" Not long after this, there was a great uproar in the\ncountry, for the king's daughter was carried off by a dragon. The\nking was full of trouble about it, both by day an night, and caused\nit to be proclaimed that whosoever brought her back should have her\nto wife.\n\nThe four brothers said to each other, \"This would be a fine\nopportunity for us to show what we can do.\" And resolved to go forth\ntogether and liberate the king's daughter. \"I will soon know where\nshe is,\" said the astronomer, and looked through his telescope and\nsaid, \"I see her already, she is far away from here on a rock in the\nsea, and the dragon is beside her watching her.\"\n\nThen he went to the king, and asked for a ship for himself and his\nbrothers, and sailed with them over the sea until they came to the\nrock.  There the king's daughter was sitting, and the dragon was\nlying asleep on her lap.  The huntsman said, \"I dare not fire, I\nshould kill the beautiful maiden at the same time.\" \"Then I will try\nmy art,\" said the thief, and he crept thither and stole her away from\nunder the dragon, so quietly and dexterously, that the monster never\nnoticed it, but went on snoring.\n\nFull of joy, they hurried off with her on board ship, and steered out\ninto the open sea, but the dragon, who when he awoke had found no\nprincess there, followed them, and came snorting angrily through the\nair.  Just as he was circling above the ship, and about to descend on\nit, the huntsman shouldered his gun, and shot him to the heart.  The\nmonster fell down dead, but was so large and powerful that his fall\nshattered the whole ship.  Fortunately, however, they laid hold of a\ncouple of planks, and swam about the wide sea.\n\nThen again they were in great peril, but the tailor, who was not\nidle, took his wondrous needle, and with a few stitches sewed the\nplanks together and they seated themselves upon them, and collected\ntogether all the fragments of the vessel.  Then he sewed these so\nskillfully together, that in a very short time the ship was once more\nseaworthy, and they could go home again in safety.\n\nWhen the king once more saw his daughter, there were great\nrejoicings.  He said to the four brothers, one of you shall have her\nto wife, but which of you it is to be you must settle among\nyourselves.  Then a heated argument arose among them, for each of\nthem preferred his own claim.  The astronomer said, \"If I had not\nseen the princess, all your arts would have been useless, so she is\nmine.\" The thief said, \"What would have been the use of your seeing,\nif I had not got her away from the dragon.  So she is mine.\" The\nhuntsman said, \"You and the princess, and all of you, would have been\ntorn to pieces by the dragon if my ball had not hit him, so she is\nmine.\" The tailor said, \"And if I, by my art, had not sewn the ship\ntogether again, you would all of you have been miserably drowned, so\nshe is mine.\"\n\nThen the king pronounced his verdict, each of you has an equal right,\nand as all of you cannot have the maiden, none of you shall have her,\nbut I will give to each of you, as a reward, half a kingdom.  The\nbrothers were pleased with this decision, and said, it is better thus\nthan that we should be at variance with each other.  Then each of\nthem received half a kingdom, and they lived with their father in the\ngreatest happiness as long as it pleased God.\n", "One-Eye, Two-Eyes, and Three-Eyes": "There was once a woman who had three daughters, the eldest of whom\nwas called One-Eye, because she had only one eye in the middle of her\nforehead, and the second, Two-Eyes, because she had two eyes like\nother folks, and the youngest, Three-Eyes, because she had three\neyes, and her third eye was also in the center of her forehead.\nHowever, as Two-Eyes saw just as other human beings did, her sisters\nand her mother could not endure her.  They said to her, \"You, with\nyour two eyes, are no better than the common people, you do not\nbelong to us.\" They pushed her about, and threw old clothes to her,\nand gave her nothing to eat but what they left, and did everything\nthat they could to make her unhappy.\n\nIt came to pass that Two-Eyes had to go out into the fields and tend\nthe goat, but she was still quite hungry, because her sisters had\ngiven her so little to eat.  So she sat down on a ridge and began to\nweep, and so bitterly that two streams ran down from her eyes.  And\nonce when she looked up in her grief, a woman was standing beside\nher, who said, \"Why are you weeping, little Two-Eyes?\" Two-Eyes\nanswered, \"Have I not reason to weep, when I have two eyes like other\npeople, and my sisters and mother hate me for it, and push me from\none corner to another, throw old clothes to me, and give me nothing\nto eat but the scraps they leave.  Today they have given me so little\nthat I am still quite hungry.\" Then the wise woman said, \"Wipe away\nyour tears, Two-Eyes, and I will tell you something to stop your ever\nsuffering from hunger again.  Just say to your goat -\n\t `Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n\t Cover the table with something to eat,'\nand then a clean well-spread little table will stand before you with\nthe most delicious food upon it of which you may eat as much as you\nare inclined for, and when you have had enough, and have no more need\nof the little table, just say,\n\t `Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n\t and take the table quite away,'\nand then it will vanish again from your sight.\" Hereupon the wise\nwoman departed.  But Two-Eyes thought, \"I must instantly make a\ntrial, and see if what she said is true, for I am far too hungry,\"\nand she said -\n\t \"Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n\t Cover the table with something to eat,\"\nand scarcely had she spoken the words than a little table, covered\nwith a white cloth, was standing there, and on it was a plate with a\nknife and fork, and a silver spoon, and the most delicious food was\nthere also, warm and smoking as if it had just come out of the\nkitchen.  Then Two-Eyes said the shortest prayer she knew, \"Lord God,\nbe our guest forever, amen,\" and helped herself to some food, and\nenjoyed it.  And when she was satisfied, she said, as the wise woman\nhad taught her -\n\t \"Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n\t And take the table quite away,\"\nand immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again.\nThat is a delightful way of keeping house, thought Two-Eyes, and was\nquite glad and happy.\n\nIn the evening, when she went home with her goat, she found a small\nearthenware dish with some food, which her sisters had set ready for\nher, but she did not touch it.  Next day she again went out with her\ngoat, and left the few bits of broken bread which had been handed to\nher, lying untouched.  The first and second time that she did this,\nher sisters did not notice it at all, but as it happened every time,\nthey did observe it, and said, \"There is something wrong about\nTwo-Eyes, she always leaves her food untasted, and she used to eat up\neverything that was given her, she must have discovered other ways of\ngetting food.\" In order that they might learn the truth, they\nresolved to send One-Eye with Two-Eyes when she went to drive her\ngoat to the pasture, to observe what Two-Eyes did when she was there,\nand whether anyone brought her anything to eat and drink.\n\nSo when Two-Eyes set out the next time, One-Eye went to her and said,\n\"I will go with you to the pasture, and see that the goat is well\ntaken care of, and driven where there is food.\" But Two-Eyes knew\nwhat was in One-Eye's mind, and drove the goat into high grass and\nsaid, \"Come, One-Eye, we will sit down, and I will sing something to\nyou.\" One-Eye sat down and was tired with the unaccustomed walk and\nthe heat of the sun, and Two-Eyes sang constantly -\n\t \"One-eye, are you waking?\n\t One-eye, are you sleeping?\"\nUntil One-Eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep, and as soon as\nTwo-Eyes saw that One-Eye was fast asleep, and could discover\nnothing, she said,\n\t \"Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n\t Cover the table with something to eat,\"\nand seated herself at her table, and ate and drank until she was\nsatisfied, and then she again cried -\n\t \"Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n\t And take the table quite away,\"\nand in an instant all had vanished.  Two-Eyes now awakened One-Eye,\nand said, \"One-Eye, you want to take care of the goat, and go to\nsleep while you are doing it, but in the meantime the goat might run\nall over the world.  Come, let us go home again.\"\n\nSo they went home, and again Two-Eyes let her dish stand untouched,\nand One-Eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat it, and\nto excuse herself said, \"I fell asleep when I was out.\" Next day the\nmother said to Three-Eyes, this time you shall go and observe if\nTwo-Eyes eats anything when she is out, and if anyone fetches her\nfood and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret.  So Three-Eyes\nwent to Two-Eyes, and said, \"I will go with you and see if the goat\nis taken proper care of, and driven where there is food.\" But\nTwo-Eyes knew what was in Three-Eyes' mind, and drove the goat into\nhigh grass and said, \"We will sit down, and I will sing something to\nyou, Three-Eyes.\" Three-Eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and\nwith the heat of the sun, and Two-Eyes began the same song as before,\nand sang -\n\t \"Three-Eyes, are you waking?\"\n\nBut then, instead of singing -\n\t \"Three-Eyes, are you sleeping?\"\n\nAs she ought to have done, she thoughtlessly sang -\n\t \"Two-Eyes, are you sleeping?\"\n\nAnd sang all the time -\n\t \"Three-Eyes, are you waking?\n\t Two-Eyes, are you sleeping?\"\n\nThen two of the eyes which Three-Eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but\nthe third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep.  It\nis true that three-eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend\nit was asleep too, but it blinked, and could see everything very\nwell.  And when two-eyes thought that three-eyes was fast asleep, she\nused her little charm -\n\t \"Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n\t Cover the table with something to eat,\"\nand ate and drank as much as her heart desired, and then ordered the\ntable to go away again,\n\t \"Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n\t And take the table quite away,\"\nand Three-Eyes had seen everything.  Then Two-Eyes came to her, waked\nher and said, \"Have you been asleep, Three-Eyes?  You keep watch very\nwell.  Come, we will go home.\" And when they got home, Two-Eyes again\ndid not eat, and Three-Eyes said to the mother, \"Now, I know why that\nhaughty thing there does not eat. When she is out, she says to the\ngoat -\n\t `Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n\t Cover the table with something to eat,'\nand then a little table appears before her covered with the best of\nfood, much better than any we have here, and when she has eaten all\nshe wants, she says -\n\t `Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n\t And take the table quite away,'\nand all disappears.  I watched everything closely.  She put two of my\neyes to sleep by means of a charm, but luckily the one in my forehead\nkept awake.\"\n\nThen the envious mother cried, \"Do you want to fare better than we\ndo?  The desire shall pass from you,\" and she fetched a butcher's\nknife, and thrust it into the heart of the goat, which fell down\ndead. When Two-Eyes saw that, she went out full of sadness, seated\nherself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept\nbitter tears.  Suddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side,\nand said, \"Two-Eyes, why are you weeping?\" \"Have I not reason to\nweep?\" she answered.  \"The goat which covered the table for me every\nday when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my mother, and now I\nshall again have to bear hunger and want.\" The wise woman said,\n\"Two-Eyes, I will give you a piece of good advice, ask your sisters\nto give you the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and bury them in\nthe ground in front of the house, and your fortune will be made.\"\nThen she vanished, and Two-Eyes went home and said to her sisters,\n\"Dear sisters, do give me some part of my goat, I don't wish for what\nis good, but give me the entrails.\" Then they laughed and said, \"If\nthat's all you want, you can have it.\" So Two-Eyes took the entrails\nand buried them quietly in the evening, in front of the house-door,\nas the wise woman had counseled her to do.\n\nNext morning, when they all awoke, and went to the house-door, there\nstood a strangely magnificent tree with leaves of silver, and fruit\nof gold hanging among them, so that in all the wide world there was\nnothing more beautiful or precious.  They did not know how the tree\ncould have come there during the night, but Two-Eyes saw that it had\ngrown up out of the entrails of the goat, for it was standing on the\nexact spot where she had buried them.  Then the mother said to\nOne-Eye, \"Climb up, my child, and gather some of the fruit of the\ntree for us.\" One-eye climbed up, but when she was about to get hold\nof one of the golden apples, the branch escaped from her hands, and\nthat happened each time, so that she could not pluck a single apple,\nlet her do what she might.  Then said the mother, \"Three-Eyes, you\nclimb up, you with your three eyes can look about you better than\nOne-Eye.\" One-Eye slipped down, and Three-Eyes climbed up.\nThree-Eyes was not more skillful, and might try as she would, but the\ngolden apples always escaped her.\n\nAt length the mother grew impatient, and climbed up herself, but\ncould get hold of the fruit no better than One-Eye and Three-Eyes,\nfor she always clutched empty air.  Then said Two-Eyes, \"Let me go\nup, perhaps I may succeed better.\" The sisters cried, \"You indeed,\nwith your two eyes, what can you do?\" But Two-Eyes climbed up, and\nthe golden apples did not avoid her, but came into her hand of their\nown accord, so that she could pluck them one after the other, and\nbrought a whole apronful down with her. The mother took them away\nfrom her, and instead of treating poor Two-Eyes any better for this,\nshe and One-Eye and Three-Eyes were only envious, because Two-Eyes\nalone had been able to get the fruit, and they treated her still more\ncruelly.\n\nIt so befell that once when they were all standing together by the\ntree, a young knight came up.  \"Quick, Two-Eyes,\" cried the two\nsisters, \"creep under this, and don't disgrace us,\" and with all\nspeed they turned an empty barrel which was standing close by the\ntree over poor Two-Eyes, and they swept the golden apples which she\nhad been gathering, under it too.  When the knight came nearer he was\na handsome lord, who stopped and admired the magnificent gold and\nsilver tree, and said to the two sisters, \"To whom does this fine\ntree belong?  Anyone who would bestow one branch of it on me might in\nreturn for it ask whatsoever he desired.\" Then One-Eye and Three-Eyes\nreplied that the tree belonged to them, and that they would give him\na branch.  They both took great trouble, but they were not able to do\nit, for the branches and fruit both moved away from them every time.\nThen said the knight, \"It is very strange that the tree should belong\nto you, and that you should not have the power to break a piece off.\"\nThey again asserted that the tree was their property.\n\nWhilst they were saying so, Two-Eyes rolled out a couple of golden\napples from under the barrel to the feet of the knight, for she was\nvexed with One-Eye and Three-Eyes, for not speaking the truth.  When\nthe knight saw the apples he was astonished, and asked where they\ncame from.  One-Eye and Three-Eyes answered that they had another\nsister, who was not allowed to show herself, for she had only two\neyes like any common person.  The knight, however, desired to see\nher, and cried, \"Two-Eyes, come forth.\" Then Two-Eyes, quite\ncomforted, came from beneath the barrel, and the knight was surprised\nat her great beauty, and said, \"You, Two-Eyes, can certainly break\noff a branch from the tree for me.\" \"Yes,\" replied Two-Eyes, \"that I\ncertainly shall be able to do, for the tree belongs to me.\" And she\nclimbed up, and with the greatest ease broke off a branch with\nbeautiful silver leaves and golden fruit, and gave it to the knight.\nThen said the knight, \"Two-Eyes, what shall I give you for it?\"\n\"Alas, answered two-eyes, \"I suffer from hunger and thirst, grief and\nwant, from early morning till late night.  If you would take me with\nyou, and rescue me, I should be happy.\" So the knight lifted Two-Eyes\non to his horse, and took her home with him to his father's castle,\nand there he gave her beautiful clothes, and meat and drink to her\nheart's content, and as he loved her so much he married her, and the\nwedding was solemnized with great rejoicing.\n\nWhen Two-Eyes was thus carried away by the handsome knight, her two\nsisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest. \"The wonderful\ntree, however, still remains with us,\" thought they, \"and even if we\ncan gather no fruit from it, still every one will stand still and\nlook at it, and come to us and admire it.  Who knows what good things\nmay be in store for us.\" But next morning, the tree had vanished, and\nall their hopes were at an end.  And when Two-Eyes looked out of the\nwindow of her own room, to her great delight it was standing in front\nof it, and so it had followed her.\n\nTwo-Eyes lived a long time in happiness.  Once two poor women came to\nher in her castle, and begged for alms.  She looked in their faces,\nand recognized her sisters, One-Eye, and Three-Eyes, who had fallen\ninto such poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread\nfrom door to door.  Two-Eyes, however, made them welcome, and was\nkind to them, and took care of them, so that they both with all their\nhearts repented the evil that they had done their sister in their\nyouth.\n", "Fair Katrinelje and Pif-Paf-Poltrie": "\"Good-day, father hollenthe.\" \"Many thanks, pif-paf-poltrie.\" \"May I\nbe allowed to have your daughter?\" \"Oh, yes, if mother malcho\nmilchcow, brother high-and-mighty, sister kasetraut, and fair\nkatrinelje are willing, you can have her.\" \"Where is mother malcho,\nthen?\" \"She is in the cow-house, milking the cow.\"\n\n\"Good-day, mother malcho.\" \"Many thanks, pif-paf-poltrie.\" \"May I be\nallowed to have your daughter?\" \"Oh, yes, if father hollenthe,\nbrother high-and-mighty, sister kasetraut, and fair katrinelje are\nwilling, you can have her.\" \"Where is brother high-and-mighty, then?\"\n\"He is in the room chopping some wood.\"\n\n\"Good-day, brother high-and-mighty.\" \"Many thanks, pif-paf-poltrie.\"\n\"May I be allowed to have your sister?\" \"Oh, yes, if father\nhollenthe, mother malcho, sister kasetraut, and fair katrinelje are\nwilling, you can have her.\" \"Where is sister kasetraut, then?\" \"She\nis in the garden cutting cabbages.\"\n\n\"Good-day, sister kasetraut.\" \"Many thanks, pif-paf-poltrie.\" \"May I\nbe allowed to have your sister?\" \"Oh, yes, if father hollenthe,\nmother malcho, brother high-and-mighty, and fair katrinelje are\nwilling, you may have her.\" \"Where is fair katrinelje, then.\" \"She is\nin the room counting out her farthings.\"\n\n\"Good day, fair katrinelje.\" \"Many thanks, pif-paf-poltrie.\" \"Will\nyou be my bride?\" \"Oh, yes, if father hollenthe, mother malcho,\nbrother high-and-mighty, and sister kasetraut are willing, I am\nready.\"\n\n\"Fair katrinelje, how much dowry do you have?\" \"Fourteen farthings in\nready money, three and a half groschen owing to me, half a pound of\ndried apples, a handful of pretzels, and a handful of roots.\n\tAnd many other things are mine,\n\tHave I not a dowry fine?\"\n\n\"Pif-paf-poltrie, what is your trade?

But in\nthe morning when he unlocked the door, he saw that their shoes were\nworn out with dancing, and no one could find out how that had come to\npass.  Then the king caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could\ndiscover where they danced at night, should choose one of them for\nhis wife and be king after his death, but that whosoever came forward\nand had not discovered it within three days and nights, should have\nforfeited his life.\n\nIt was not long before a king's son presented himself, and offered to\nundertake the enterprise. He was well received, and in the evening\nwas led into a room adjoining the princesses, sleeping-chamber.  His\nbed was placed there, and he was to observe where they went and\ndanced, and in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away\nto some other place, the door of their room was left open. But the\neyelids of the prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep, and\nwhen he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for\ntheir shoes were standing there with holes in the soles.  On the\nsecond and third nights there was no difference, and then his head\nwas struck off without mercy.\n\nMany others came after this and undertook the enterprise, but all\nforfeited their lives.  Now it came to pass that a poor soldier, who\nhad a wound, and could serve no longer, found himself on the road to\nthe town where the king lived.  There he met an old woman, who asked\nhim where he was going.  \"I hardly know myself,\" answered he, and\nadded in jest, \"I had half a mind to discover where the princesses\ndanced their shoes into holes, and thus become king.\" \"That is not so\ndifficult,\" said the old woman, \"you must not drink the wine which\nwill be brought to you at night, and must pretend to be sound\nasleep.\" With that she gave him a little cloak, and said, \"If you\nwear this, you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the\ntwelve.\" When the soldier had received this good advice, he fell to\nin earnest, took heart, went to the king, and announced himself as a\nsuitor.  He was as well received as the others, and royal garments\nwere put upon him.  He was conducted that evening at bed-time into\nthe antechamber, and as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came\nand brought him a cup of wine, but he had tied a sponge under his\nchin, and let the wine run down into it, without drinking a drop.\n\nThen he lay down and when he had lain a while, he began to snore, as\nif in the deepest sleep.  The twelve princesses heard that, and\nlaughed, and the eldest said, \"He, too, might as well have saved his\nlife.\" With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards,\nand brought out pretty dresses, dressed themselves before the\nmirrors, sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance.\nOnly the youngest said, \"I know not how it is, you are very happy,\nbut I feel very strange, some misfortune is certainly about to befall\nus.\" \"You are a goose, who are always frightened,\" said the eldest.\n\"Have you forgotten how many kings' sons have already come here in\nvain.  I had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught,\nthe booby would not have awakened anyway.\"\n\nWhen they were all ready they looked carefully at the soldier, but he\nhad closed his eyes and did not move or stir, so they felt themselves\nsafe enough.  The eldest then went to her bed and tapped it,\nwhereupon it immediately sank into the earth, and one after the other\nthey descended through the opening, the eldest going first.  The\nsoldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his\nlittle cloak, and went down last with the youngest.  Half-way down\nthe steps, he just trod a little on her dress, she was terrified at\nthat, and cried out, \"What is that?  Who is pulling my dress?\" \"Don't\nbe so silly,\" said the eldest, \"you have caught it on a nail.\"\n\nThen they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom,\nthey were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the\nleaves of which were of silver, and shone and glistened. The soldier\nthought, \"I must carry a token away with me,\" and broke off a twig\nfrom one of them, on which the tree cracked with a loud report.  The\nyoungest cried out again.  \"Something is wrong, did you hear the\ncrack?\" But the eldest said, \"It is a gun fired for joy, because we\nhave got rid of our prince so quickly.\" After that they came into an\navenue where all the leaves were of gold, and lastly into a third\nwhere they were of bright diamonds, he broke off a twig from each,\nwhich made such a crack each time that the youngest started back in\nterror, but the eldest still maintained that they were salutes.\n\nThey went on and came to a great lake whereon stood twelve little\nboats, and in every boat sat a handsome prince, all of whom were\nwaiting for the twelve, and each took one of them with him, but the\nsoldier seated himself by the youngest.  Then her prince said, \"I\nwonder why the boat is so much heavier to-day. I shall have to row\nwith all my strength, if I am to get it across.\" \"What should cause\nthat,\" said the youngest, \"but the warm weather?\" \"I feel very warm\ntoo.\" On the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid, brightly-lit\ncastle, from whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and\nkettle-drums.  They rowed there, entered, and each prince danced with\nthe girl he loved, but the soldier danced with them unseen, and when\none of them had a cup of wine in her hand he drank it up, so that the\ncup was empty when she carried it to her mouth, the youngest was\nalarmed at this, but the eldest always silenced her.  They danced\nthere till three o'clock in the morning when all the shoes were\ndanced into holes, and they were forced to leave off, the princes\nrowed them back again over the lake, and this time the soldier seated\nhimself by the eldest.\n\nOn the shore they took leave of their princes, and promised to return\nthe following night.  When they reached the stairs the soldier ran on\nin front and lay down in his bed, and when the twelve had come up\nslowly and wearily, he was already snoring so loudly that they could\nall hear him, and they said, \"So far as he is concerned, we are\nsafe.\" They took off their beautiful dresses, laid them away, put the\nworn-out shoes under the bed, and lay down.  Next morning the soldier\nwas resolved not to speak, but to watch the wonderful goings-on, and\nagain went with them a second and a third night.\n\nThen everything was just as it had been the first time, and each time\nthey danced until their shoes were worn to pieces.  But the third\ntime he took a cup away with him as a token.  When the hour had\narrived for him to give his answer, he took the three twigs and the\ncup, and went to the king, but the twelve stood behind the door, and\nlistened for what he was going to say.  When the king put the\nquestion, \"Where have my twelve daughters danced their shoes to\npieces in the night?\" He answered, \"In an underground castle with\ntwelve princes,\" and related how it had come to pass, and brought out\nthe tokens.  The king then summoned his daughters, and asked them if\nthe soldier had told the truth, and when they saw that they were\nbetrayed, and that falsehood would be of no avail, they were obliged\nto confess all.  Thereupon the king asked which of them he would have\nto wife.  He answered, \"I am no longer young, so give me the eldest.\"\nThen the wedding was celebrated on the self-same day, and the kingdom\nwas promised him after the king's death.  But the princes were\nbewitched for as many days as they had danced nights with the twelve.\n", "The Six Servants": "In olden times there lived an aged queen who was a sorceress, and her\ndaughter was the most beautiful maiden under the sun.  The old woman,\nhowever, had no other thought than how to lure mankind to\ndestruction, and when a wooer appeared, she said that whosoever\nwished to have her daughter, must first perform a task, or die.  Many\nhad been dazzled by the daughter's beauty, and had actually risked\nthis, but they never could accomplish what the old woman enjoined\nthem to do, and then no mercy was shown, they had to kneel down, and\ntheir heads were struck off.\n\nA certain king's son who had also heard of the maiden's beauty, said\nto his father, \"Let me go there, I want to demand her in marriage.\"\n\"Never,\" answered the king, \"if you were to go, it would be going to\nyour death.\" On this the son lay down and was sick unto death, and\nfor seven years he lay there, and no physician could heal him. When\nthe father perceived that all hope was over, with a heavy heart he\nsaid to him, \"Go thither, and try your luck, for I know no other\nmeans of curing you.\" When the son heard that, he rose from his bed\nand was well again, and joyfully set out on his way.\n\nAnd it came to pass that as he was riding across a heath, he saw from\nafar something like a great heap of hay laying on the ground, and\nwhen he drew nearer, he could see that it was the stomach of a man,\nwho had laid himself down there, but the stomach looked like a small\nmountain.  When the fat man saw the traveler, he stood up and said,\n\"If you are in need of any one, take me into your service.\" The\nprince answered, \"What can I do with such a clumsy man?\" \"Oh,\" said\nthe stout one, \"this is nothing, when I really puff myself up, I am\nthree thousand times fatter.\" \"If that's the case,\" said the prince,\n\"I can make use of you, come with me.\"\n\nSo the stout one followed the prince, and after a while they found\nanother man who was lying on the ground with his ear laid to the\nturf.  \"What are you doing there?\" asked the king's son.  \"I am\nlistening,\" replied the man.  \"What are you listening to so\nattentively?\" \"I am listening to what is just going on in the world,\nfor nothing escapes my ears, I even hear the grass growing.\" \"Tell\nme,\" said the prince, \"what you hear at the court of the old queen\nwho has the beautiful daughter.\" Then he answered, \"I hear the\nwhizzing of the sword that is striking off a wooer's head.\" The\nking's son said, \"I can make use of you, come with me.\"\n\nThey went onwards, and then saw a pair of feet lying and part of a\npair of legs, but could not see the rest of the body.  When they had\nwalked on for a great distance, they came to the body, and at last to\nthe head also.  \"Why,\" said the prince, \"what a tall rascal you are.\"\n\"Oh,\" replied the tall one, \"that is nothing at all yet, when I\nreally stretch out my limbs, I am three thousand times as tall, and\ntaller than the highest mountain on earth.  I will gladly enter your\nservice, if you will take me.\" \"Come with me,\" said the prince, \"I\ncan make use of you.\"\n\nThey went onwards and found a man sitting by the road who had bound\nup his eyes.  The prince said to him, \"Have you weak eyes, that you\ncannot look at the light?\" \"No,\" replied the man, \"but I must not\nremove the bandage, for whatsoever I look at with my eyes, splits to\npieces, so powerful is my glance.  If you can use that, I shall be\nglad to serve you.\" \"Come with me,\" replied the king's son, \"I can\nmake use of you.\"\n\nThey journeyed onwards and found a man who was lying in the hot\nsunshine, trembling and shivering all over his body, so that not a\nlimb was still.  \"How can you shiver when the sun is shining so\nwarm?\" said the king's son.  \"Alas,\" replied the man, \"I am of quite\na different nature.  The hotter it is, the colder I am, and the frost\npierces through all my bones, and the colder it is, the hotter I am.\nIn the midst of ice, I cannot endure the heat, nor in the midst of\nfire, the cold.\" \"You are a strange fellow,\" said the prince, \"but if\nyou will enter my service, follow me.\"\n\nThey traveled onwards, and saw a man standing who made a long neck\nand looked about him, and could see over all the mountains.  \"What\nare you looking at so eagerly?\" said the king's son.  The man\nreplied, \"I have such sharp eyes that I can see into every forest and\nfield, and hill and valley, all over the world.\" The prince said,\n\"Come with me if you will, for I am still in want of such an one.\"\n\nAnd now the king's son and his six servants came to the town where\nthe aged queen dwelt.  He did not tell her who he was, but said, \"If\nyou will give me your beautiful daughter, I will perform any task you\nset me.\" The sorceress was delighted to get such a handsome youth as\nthis into her net, and said, \"I will set you three tasks, and if you\nare able to perform them all, you shall be husband and master of my\ndaughter.\" \"What is the first to be?\" \"You shall fetch me my ring\nwhich I have dropped into the red sea.\"\n\nSo the king's son went home to his servants and said, \"The first task\nis not easy.  A ring is to be got out of the red sea.  Come, find\nsome way of doing it.\" Then the man with the sharp sight said, \"I\nwill see where it is lying,\" and looked down into the water and said,\n\"It is hanging there, on a pointed stone.\" The tall one carried them\nthither, and said, \"I would soon get it out, if I could only see it.\"\n\"Oh, is that all,\" cried the stout one, and lay down and put his\nmouth to the water, on which all the waves fell into it just as if it\nhad been a whirlpool, and he drank up the whole sea till it was as\ndry as a meadow.  The tall one stooped down a little, and brought out\nthe ring with his hand.\n\nThen the king's son rejoiced when he had the ring, and took it to the\nold queen.  She was astonished, and said, \"Yes, it is the right ring.\nYou have safely performed the first task, but now comes the second.\nDo you see the meadow in front of my palace?  Three hundred fat oxen\nare feeding there, and these must you eat, skin, hair, bones, horns\nand all, and down below in my cellar lie three hundred casks of wine,\nand these you must drink up as well, and if one hair of the oxen, or\none little drop of the wine is left, your life will be forfeited to\nme.\" \"May I invite no guests to this repast?\" inquired the prince,\n\"No dinner is good without some company.\" The old woman laughed\nmaliciously, and replied, \"You may invite one for the sake of\ncompanionship, but no more.\"\n\nThe king's son went to his servants and said to the stout one, \"You\nshall be my guest to-day, and shall eat your fill.\" Hereupon the\nstout one puffed himself up and ate the three hundred oxen without\nleaving one single hair, and then he asked if he was to have nothing\nbut his breakfast.  Then he drank the wine straight from the casks\nwithout feeling any need of a glass, and drained them down to their\ndregs.\n\nWhen the meal was over, the prince went to the old woman, and told\nher that the second task also was performed.  She wondered at this\nand said, \"No one has ever done so much before, but one task still\nremains,\" and she thought to herself, \"You shall not escape me, and\nwill not keep your head on your shoulders.\" \"This night,\" said she,\n\"I will bring my daughter to you in your chamber, and you shall put\nyour arms round her, but when you are sitting there together, beware\nof falling asleep.  When twelve o'clock is striking, I will come, and\nif she is then no longer in your arms, you are lost.\"\n\nThe prince thought, \"The task is easy, I will most certainly keep my\neyes open.\" Nevertheless he called his servants, told them what the\nold woman had said, and remarked, \"Who knows what treachery lurks\nbehind this?  Foresight is a good thing - keep watch, and take\ncare that the maiden does not go out of my room again.\" When night\nfell, the old woman came with her daughter, and gave her into the\nprinces's arms, and then the tall one wound himself round the two in\na circle, and the stout one placed himself by the door, so that no\nliving creature could enter.  There the two sat, and the maiden spoke\nnever a word, but the moon shone through the window on her face, and\nthe prince could behold her wondrous beauty.  He did nothing but gaze\nat her, and was filled with love and happiness, and his eyes never\nfelt weary.  This lasted until eleven o'clock, when the old woman\ncast such a spell over all of them that they fell asleep, and at the\nself-same moment the maiden was carried away.\n\nThen they all slept soundly until a quarter to twelve, when the magic\nlost its power, and all awoke again.  \"Oh, misery and misfortune,\"\ncried the prince, \"now I am lost.\" The faithful servants also began\nto lament, but the listener said, \"Be quiet, I want to listen.\" Then\nhe listened for an instant and said, \"She is on a rock, three hundred\nleagues from hence, bewailing her fate.  You alone, tall one, can\nhelp her, if you will stand up, you will be there in a couple of\nsteps.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the tall one, \"but the one with the sharp eyes must\ngo with me, that we may destroy the rock.\" Then the tall one took the\none with bandaged eyes on his back, and in the twinkling of an eye\nthey were on the enchanted rock.  The tall one immediately took the\nbandage from the other's eyes, and he did but look round, and the\nrock shivered into a thousand pieces. Then the tall one took the\nmaiden in his arms, carried her back in a second, then fetched his\ncompanion with the same rapidity, and before it struck twelve they\nwere all sitting as they had sat before, quite merrily and happily.\nWhen twelve struck, the aged sorceress came stealing in with a\nmalicious face, as much as to say, \"Now he is mine, for she believed\nthat her daughter was on the rock three hundred leagues off.\" But\nwhen she saw her in the prince's arms, she was alarmed, and said,\n\"Here is one who knows more than I do.\" She dared not make any\nopposition, and was forced to give him her daughter.  But she\nwhispered in her ear, \"It is a disgrace to you to have to obey common\npeople, and that you are not allowed to choose a husband to your own\nliking.\"\n\nOn this the proud heart of the maiden was filled with anger, and she\nmeditated revenge.  Next morning she caused three hundred great\nbundles of wood to be got together, and said to the prince that\nthough the three tasks were performed, she would still not be his\nwife until someone was ready to seat himself in the midst of the\nwood, and bear the fire.  She thought that none of his servants would\nlet themselves be burnt for him, and that out of love for her, he\nhimself would place himself upon it, and then she would be free.  But\nthe servants said, \"Every one of us has done something except the\nfrosty one, he must set to work, and they put him in the middle of\nthe pile, and set fire to it.\" Then the fire began to burn, and burnt\nfor three days until all the wood was consumed, and when the flames\nhad burnt out, the frosty one was standing amid the ashes, trembling\nlike an aspen leaf, and saying, \"I never felt such a frost during the\nwhole course of my life, if it had lasted much longer, I should have\nbeen benumbed.\"\n\nAs no other pretext was to be found, the beautiful maiden was now\nforced to take the unknown youth as a husband.  But when they drove\naway to church, the old woman said, \"I cannot endure the disgrace,\"\nand sent her warriors after them with orders to cut down all who\nopposed them, and bring back her daughter.  But the listener had\nsharpened his ears, and heard the secret discourse of the old woman.\n\"What shall we do?\" said he to the stout one.  But he knew what to\ndo, and spat out once or twice behind the carriage some of the\nsea-water which he had drunk, and a great lake arose in which the\nwarriors were caught and drowned.\n\nWhen the sorceress perceived that, she sent her mailed knights, but\nthe listener heard the rattling of their armor, and undid the bandage\nfrom one eye of sharp-eyes, who looked for a while rather fixedly at\nthe enemy's troops, on which they all sprang to pieces like glass.\nThen the youth and the maiden went on their way undisturbed, and when\nthe two had been blessed in church, the six servants took leave, and\nsaid to their master, \"Your wishes are now satisfied, you need us no\nlonger, we will go our way and seek our fortunes.\"\n\nHalf a league from the palace of the prince's father was a village\nnear which a swineherd tended his herd, and when they came thither\nthe prince said to his wife, \"Do you know who I really am?  I am no\nprince, but a herder of swine, and the man who is there with that\nherd, is my father.  We two shall have to set to work also, and help\nhim.\" Then he alighted with her at the inn, and secretly told the\ninnkeepers to take away her royal apparel during the night.  So when\nshe awoke in the morning, she had nothing to put on, and the\ninnkeeper's wife gave her an old gown and a pair of worsted\nstockings, and at the same time seemed to consider it a great\npresent, and said, \"If it were not for the sake of your husband I\nshould have given you nothing at all.\" Then the princess believed\nthat he really was a swineherd, and tended the herd with him, and\nthought to herself, \"I have deserved this for my haughtiness and\npride.\"\n\nThis lasted for a week, and then she could endure it no longer, for\nshe had sores on her feet.  And now came a couple of people who asked\nif she knew who her husband was.  \"Yes,\" she answered, \"he is a\nswineherd, and has just gone out with cords and ropes to try to drive\na little bargain.\" But they said, \"Just come with us, and we will\ntake you to him,\" and they took her up to the palace, and when she\nentered the hall, there stood her husband in kingly raiment.  But she\ndid not recognize him until he took her in his arms, kissed her, and\nsaid, \"I suffered so much for you that you, too, had to suffer for\nme.\" And then the wedding was celebrated, and he who has related\nthis, wishes that he, too, had been present at it.\n", "The White Bride and the Black One": "A woman was walking about the fields with her daughter and her\nstep-daughter cutting fodder, when the Lord came towards them in the\nform of a poor man, and asked, \"Which is the way into the village?\"\n\"If you want to know,\" said the mother, \"seek it for yourself,\" and\nthe daughter added, \"If you are afraid you will not find it, take a\nguide with you.\" But the step-daughter said, \"Poor man, I will take\nyou there, come with me.\"\n\nThen God was angry with the mother and daughter, and turned His back\non them, and wished that they should become as black as night and as\nugly as sin.  To the poor step-daughter, however, God was gracious,\nand went with her, and when they were near the village, He said a\nblessing over her, and spoke, \"Choose three things for yourself, and\nI will grant them to you.\" Then said the maiden, \"I should like to be\nas beautiful and fair as the sun,\" and instantly she was white and\nfair as day.  \"Then I should like to have a purse of money which\nwould never grow empty.\" That the Lord gave her also, but He said,\n\"Do not forget what is best of all.\" Said she, \"For my third wish, I\ndesire, after my death, to inhabit the eternal kingdom of heaven.\"\nThat also was granted unto her, and then the Lord left her.\n\nWhen the step-mother came home with her daughter, and they saw that\nthey were both as black as coal and ugly, but that the step-daughter\nwas white and beautiful, wickedness increased still more in their\nhearts, and they thought of nothing else but how they could do her an\ninjury.  The step-daughter, however, had a brother called Reginer,\nwhom she loved much, and she told him all that had happened.  And\nReginer said to her, \"Dear sister, I will paint your portrait, that I\nmay continually see you before my eyes, for my love for you is so\ngreat that I should like always to look at you.\" Then she answered,\n\"But, I pray you, let no one see the picture.\"\n\nSo he painted his sister and hung up the picture in his room, he,\nhowever, dwelt in the king's palace, for he was his coachman. Every\nday he went and stood before the picture, and thanked God for the\nhappiness of having such a dear sister.  Now it happened that the\nking whom he served, had just lost his wife, who had been so\nbeautiful that no one could be found to compare with her, and on this\naccount the king was in deep grief. The attendants about the court,\nhowever, noticed that the coachman stood daily before this beautiful\npicture, and they were jealous of him, so they informed the king.\nThen the latter ordered the picture to be brought to him, and when he\nsaw that it was like his lost wife in every respect, except that it\nwas still more beautiful, he fell mortally in love with it He caused\nthe coachman to be brought before him, and asked whom the portrait\nrepresented.  The coachman said it was his sister, so the king\nresolved to take no one but her as his wife, and gave him a carriage\nand horses and splendid garments of cloth of gold, and sent him forth\nto fetch his chosen bride.\n\nWhen Reginer came on this errand, his sister was glad, but the black\nmaiden was jealous of her good fortune, and grew angry above all\nmeasure, and said to her mother, \"Of what use are all your arts to us\nnow when you cannot procure such a piece of luck for me.\" \"Be quiet,\"\nsaid the old woman, \"I will soon divert it to you,\" - and by her arts\nof witchcraft, she so troubled the eyes of the coachman that he was\nhalf-blind, and she stopped the ears of the white maiden so that she\nwas half-deaf.  Then they got into the carriage, first the bride in\nher noble royal apparel, then the step-mother with her daughter, and\nReginer sat on the box to drive.  When they had been on the way for\nsome time the coachman cried,\n\t \"Cover thee well, my sister dear,\n\t That the rain may not wet thee,\n\t That the wind may not load thee with dust,\n\t That thou may'st be fair and beautiful\n\t When thou appearest before the king.\"\n\nThe bride asked, \"What is my dear brother saying?\" \"Ah,\" said the old\nwoman, \"he says that you ought to take off your golden dress and give\nit to your sister.\" Then she took it off, and put it on the black\nmaiden, who gave her in exchange for it a shabby grey gown.  They\ndrove onwards, and a short time afterwards, the brother again cried,\n\t \"Cover thee well, my sister dear,\n\t That the rain may not wet thee,\n\t That the wind may not load thee with dust,\n\t That thou may'st be fair and beautiful\n\t When thou appearest before the king.\"\n\nThe bride asked, \"What is my dear brother saying?\" \"Ah,\" said the old\nwoman, \"he says that you ought to take off your golden hood and give\nit to your sister.\" So she took off the hood and put it on her\nsister, and sat with her own head uncovered.  And they drove on\nfarther.  After a while, the brother once more cried,\n\t \"Cover thee well, my sister dear,\n\t That the rain may not wet thee,\n\t That the wind may not load thee with dust,\n\t That thou may'st be fair and beautiful\n\t When thou appearest before the king.\"\n\nThe bride asked, \"What is my dear brother saying?\" \"Ah,\" said the old\nwoman, \"he says you must look out of the carriage.\" They happened to\nbe on a bridge, which crossed deep water. When the bride stood up and\nleant forward out of the carriage, they both pushed her out, and she\nfell into the middle of the water.  At the same moment that she sank,\na snow-white duck arose out of the mirror-smooth water, and swam down\nthe river.\n\nThe brother had observed nothing of it, and drove the carriage on\nuntil they reached the court.  Then he took the black maiden to the\nking as his sister, and thought she really was so, because his eyes\nwere dim, and he saw the golden garments glittering.  When the king\nsaw the boundless ugliness of his intended bride, he was very angry,\nand ordered the coachman to be thrown into a pit which was full of\nadders and nests of snakes.  The old witch, however, knew so well how\nto flatter the king and deceive his eyes by her arts, that he kept\nher and her daughter until she appeared quite endurable to him, and\nhe really married her.\n\nOne evening when the black bride was sitting on the king's knee, a\nwhite duck came swimming up the gutter to the kitchen, and said to\nthe kitchen-boy, \"Boy, light a fire, that I may warm my feathers.\"\nThe kitchen-boy did it, and lighted a fire on the hearth.  Then came\nthe duck and sat down by it, and shook herself and smoothed her\nfeathers to rights with her bill. While she was thus sitting and\nenjoying herself, she asked, \"What is my brother Reginer doing?\" The\nscullery-boy replied, \"He is imprisoned in the pit with adders and\nwith snakes.\" Then she asked, \"What is the black witch doing in the\nhouse?\" The boy answered, \"She is loved by the king and happy.\" \"May\nGod have mercy on him,\" said the duck, and swam forth by the gutter.\n\nThe next night she came again and put the same questions, and the\nthird night also.  Then the kitchen-boy could bear it no longer, and\nwent to the king and revealed all to him.  The king, however, wanted\nto see it for himself, and next evening went thither, and when the\nduck thrust her head in through the gutter, he took his sword and cut\nthrough her neck, and suddenly she changed into a most beautiful\nmaiden, exactly like the picture, which her brother had made of her.\nThe king was full of joy, and as she stood there quite wet, he caused\nsplendid apparel to be brought and had her clothed in it.\n\nThen she told how she had been betrayed by cunning and falsehood, and\nat last thrown down into the water, and her first request was that\nher brother should be brought forth from the pit of snakes, and when\nthe king had fulfilled this request, he went into the chamber where\nthe old witch was, and asked if she knew the punishment for one who\ndoes this and that, and related what had happened.  Then was she so\nblinded that she was aware of nothing and said, \"She deserves to be\nstripped naked, and put into a barrel with nails, and that a horse\nshould be harnessed to the barrel, and the horse sent all over the\nworld.\" All of which was done to her, and to her black daughter.  But\nthe king married the white and beautiful bride, and rewarded her\nfaithful brother, and made him a rich and distinguished man.\n", "Iron John": "***There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near\nhis palace, full of all kinds of wild animals.  One day he sent\nout a huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back.\nPerhaps some accident has befallen him, said the king, and the\nnext day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him,\nbut they too stayed away.  Then on the third day, he sent for all\nhis huntsmen, and said, scour the whole forest through, and do\nnot give up until you have found all three.  But of these also,\nnone came home again, and of the pack of hounds which they had\ntaken with them, none were seen again.  From that time forth,\nno one would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay\nthere in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it,\nbut sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it.  This lasted\nfor many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself\nto the king as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the\ndangerous forest.  The king, however, would not give his consent,\nand said, it is not safe in there, I fear it would fare with you\nno better than with the others, and you would never come out\nagain.  The huntsman replied, lord, I will venture it at my own\nrisk, of fear I know nothing.\nThe huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest.\nIt was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way,\nand wanted to pursue it, but hardly had the dog run two steps\nwhen it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a\nnaked\narm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it\nunder.  When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched\nthree men to come with buckets and bale out the water.  When\nthey could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body\nwas brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face\ndown to his knees.  They bound him with cords, and led\nhim away to the castle.  There was great astonishment over the\nwild man, the king, however, had him put in an iron cage in his\ncourt-yard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death,\nand the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping.\nAnd from this time forth every one could again go into the\nforest with safety.\nThe king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the\ncourt-yard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into\nthe cage.  The boy ran thither and said, give me my ball out.\nNot till you have opened the door for me, answered the man.  No,\nsaid the boy, I will not do that, the king has forbidden it,\nand ran away.  The next day he again went and asked for his\nball.  The wild man said, open my\ndoor, but the boy would not.  On the third day the king had\nridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said, I\ncannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.\nThen the wild man said, it lies under your mother's pillow,\nyou can get it there.  The boy, who wanted to have his ball back,\ncast all thought to the winds, and brought the key.  The door\nopened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers.  When\nit was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball,\nand hurried away.  The boy had become afraid, he called and\ncried after him, oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be\nbeaten.  The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his\nshoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest.  When the\nking came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen\nhow that had happened.  She knew nothing about it, and sought the\nkey, but it was gone.  She called the boy, but no one answered.\nThe king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but\nthey did not find him.  Then he could easily guess what had\nhappened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.\nWhen the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he\ntook the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him, you\nwill never see your father and mother again, but I will keep\nyou with me, for you have set me free, and I have compassion\non you.  If you do all I bid you, you shall fare well.  Of\ntreasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the\nworld.  He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept,\nand the next morning the man took him to a well, and said,\nbehold, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal, you\nshall sit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into\nit, or it will be polluted.  I will come every evening to see if\nyou have obeyed my order.  The boy placed himself by the brink of\nthe well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show\nitself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.  As he was\nthus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he\ninvoluntarily put it in the water.  He drew it quickly out\nagain, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains\nhe took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose.  In\nthe evening iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said,\nwhat has happened to the well.  Nothing,\nnothing, he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that\nthe man might not see it.  But he said, you have dipped your\nfinger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care\nyou do not again let anything go in.  By daybreak the boy was\nalready sitting by the well and watching it.  His finger hurt\nhim again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily\na hair fell down into the well.  He took it quickly out, but\nit was already quite gilded.  Iron Hans came, and already knew\nwhat had happened.  You have let a hair fall into the well,\nsaid he.  I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this\nhappens for the third time then the well is polluted, and you\ncan no longer remain with me.\nOn the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his\nfinger, however much it hurt him.  But the time was long to\nhim, and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface\nof the water.  And as he still bent down more and more while he\nwas doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his\nlong hair fell down from his shoulders into the water.  He\nraised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head\nwas already golden and shone like the sun.  You can imagine how\nterrified the poor boy was.  He took his pocket-handkerchief\nand tied it round his head, in order that the man might not\nsee it.  When he came he already knew everything, and said,\ntake the handkerchief off.  Then the golden hair streamed forth,\nand let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use.\nYou have not stood the trial, and can stay here no longer.  Go\nforth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.  But\nas you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is\none thing I will grant you.  If you fall into any difficulty,\ncome to the forest and cry, iron Hans, and then I will come and\nhelp you.  My power is great, greater than you think, and I have\ngold and silver in abundance.\nThen the king's son left the forest, and walked by beaten and\nunbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great\ncity.  There he looked for work, but could find none, and he\nhad learnt nothing by which he could help himself.  At length\nhe went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in.\nThe people about\ncourt did not at all know what use they could make of him, but\nthey liked him, and told him to stay.  At length the cook took\nhim into his service, and said he might carry wood and water, and\nrake the cinders together.  Once when it so happened that\nno one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the\nfood to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his\ngolden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on.  Such a thing\nas that had never yet come under the king's notice, and he said,\nwhen you come to the royal table you must take your hat off.  He\nanswered, ah, lord, I cannot.  I have a bad sore place on my\nhead.  Then the king had the cook called before him and scolded\nhim, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his\nservice, and that he was to send him away at once.  The cook,\nhowever, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener's\nboy.\nAnd now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig,\nand bear the wind and bad weather.  Once in summer when he was\nworking alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his\nlittle cap off that the air might cool him.  As the sun shone\non his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into\nthe bed-room of the king's daughter, and up she sprang to\nsee what that could be.  Then she saw the boy, and cried to\nhim, boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.  He put his cap on\nwith all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them\ntogether.  When he was ascending the stairs with them, the\ngardener met him, and said, how can you take the king's daughter a\ngarland of such common flowers.  Go quickly, and get another,\nand seek out the prettiest and rarest.  Oh, no, replied the\nboy, the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.\nWhen he got into the room, the king's daughter said, take\nyour cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.\nHe again said, I may not, I have a sore head.  She, however,\ncaught at his cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair\nrolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold.\nHe wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him\na handful of ducats.  With these he departed, but he cared\nnothing for the gold pieces.  He took them to the gardener, and\nsaid, I present them to\nyour children, they can play with them.  The following day the\nking's daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a\nwreath of field-flowers, and when he went in with it, she\ninstantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from\nhim, but he held it fast with both hands.  She again gave him a\nhandful of ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them\nto the gardener for playthings for his children.  On the third\nday things went just the same.  She could not get his cap away\nfrom him, and he would not have her money.\nNot long afterwards, the country was overrun by war.  The king\ngathered together his people, and did not know whether or not\nhe could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior\nin strength and had a mighty army.  Then said the gardener's boy,\nI am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give me a\nI am grown up, and will go the the wars also, only give me a\nhorse.  The others laughed, and said, seek one for yourself when\nwe are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for you.\nWhen they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and led the\nhorse out.  It was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety\njig, hobblety jig, nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away\nto the dark forest.  When he came to the outskirts, he called\n'iron Hans, three times so loudly that it echoed through the\ntrees.  Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said,\nwhat do you desire.  I want a strong steed, for I am going to the\nwars.  That you shall have, and still more than you ask for.\nThen the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not\nlong before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that\nsnorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained,\nand behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely\nequipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun.  The\nyouth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy,\nmounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers.  When\nhe got near the battle-field a great part of the king's men had\nalready fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way.\nThen the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke\nlike a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed\nhim.  They began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never\nstopped, until there was not a single man left.  Instead\nof returning to the king, however, he conducted his troop\nby byways back to the forest, and called forth iron Hans.\nWhat do you desire, asked the wild man.  Take back your horse and\nyour troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.  All\nthat he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged\nhorse.  When the king returned to his palace, his daughter went\nto meet him, and wished him joy of his victory.  I am not the\none who carried away the victory, said he, but a strange knight\nwho came to my assistance with his soldiers.  The daughter\nwanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the king did\nnot know, and said, he followed the enemy, and I did not see him\nagain.  She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he\nsmiled, and said, he has just come home on his three-legged\nhorse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying, here\ncomes our hobblety jig back again.  They asked, too, under\nwhat hedge have you been lying sleeping all the time.  So he\nsaid, I did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without\nme.  And then he was still more ridiculed.\nThe king said to his daughter, I will proclaim a great feast\nthat shall last for three days, and you shall throw a golden\napple.  Perhaps the unknown man will show himself.  When the\nfeast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called\niron Hans.  What do you desire, asked he.  That I may catch the\nking's daughter's golden apple.  It is as safe as if you had\nit already, said iron Hans.  You shall likewise have a suit of\nred armor for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.\nWhen the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his\nplace amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one.  The\nking's daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the\nknights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he\nhad it he galloped away.\nOn the second day iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and\ngave him a white horse.  Again he was the only one who caught\nthe apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped\noff with it.  The king grew angry, and said, that is not allowed.\nHe must appear before me and tell his name.  He gave the order\nthat if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again\nthey should\npursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were\nto cut him down and stab him.\nOn the third day, he received from iron Hans a suit of black armor\nand a black horse, and again he caught the apple.  But when he was\nriding off with it, the king's attendants pursued him, and\none of them got so near him that he wounded the youth's leg\nwith the point of his sword.  The youth nevertheless escaped\nfrom them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell\nfrom the youth's head, and they could see that he had golden\nhair.  They rode back and announced this to the king.\nThe following day the king's daughter asked the gardener about\nhis boy.  He is at work in the garden.  The queer creature has\nbeen at the festival too, and only came home yesterday evening.\nHe has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he\nhas won.\nThe king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again\nhad his little cap on his head.  But the king's daughter went up\nto him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down\nover his shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed.\nAre you the knight who came every day to the festival, always in\ndifferent colors, and who caught the three golden apples, asked\nthe king.  Yes, answered he, and here the apples are, and he\ntook them out of his pocket, and returned them to the king.  If\nyou desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people\ngave me when they followed me.  But I am likewise the knight\nwho helped you to your victory over your enemies.  If you can\nperform such deeds as that, you are no gardener's boy, tell me,\nwho is your father.  My father is a mighty king, and gold have\nI in plenty as great as I require.  I well see, said the king,\nthat I owe thanks to you, can I do anything to please you.  Yes,\nanswered he, that indeed you can.  Give me your daughter to wife.\nThe maiden laughed, and said, he does not stand much on ceremony,\nbut I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no\ngardener's boy, and then she went and kissed him.  His father and\nmother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they\nhad given up all\nhope of ever seeing their dear son again.  And as they were sitting\nat the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors\nopened, and a stately king came in with a great retinue.  He went\nup to the youth, embraced him and said, I am iron Hans, and was by\nenchantment a wild man, but you have set me free.  All the\ntreasures which I possess, shall be your property.\n", "The Three Black Princesses": "East india was besieged by an enemy who would not retire until\nhe had received six hundred dollars.  Then the townsfolk caused\nit to be proclaimed by beat of drum that whosoever was able to\nprocure the money should be burgomaster.  Now there was a poor\nfisherman who fished on the sea with his son, and the enemy came\nand took the son prisoner, and gave the father six hundred\ndollars for him.  So the father went and gave them to the great\nmen of the town, and the enemy departed, and the fisherman became\nburgomaster.  Then it was proclaimed that whosoever did not say\n'mr. Burgomaster, should be put to death on the gallows.\nThe son got away again from the enemy, and came to a great\nforest on a high mountain.  The mountain opened, and he went\ninto a great enchanted castle, wherein chairs, tables, and\nbenches were all hung with black.  Then came three young\nprincesses who were dressed entirely in black, but had a little\nwhite on their faces.  They told him he was not to be afraid,\nthey would not hurt him, and that he could rescue them.  He\nsaid he would gladly do that, if he did but know how.  At\nthis, they told him he must for a whole year not speak to them\nand also not look at them, and what he wanted to have he was\njust to ask for, and if they dared give him an answer they would\ndo so.  When he had been there for a long while he said\nhe should like to go to his father, and they told him he might\ngo.  He was to take with him this purse with money, put on this\ncoat, and in a week he must be back there again.\nThen he was lifted up, and was instantly in east india.  He could\nno longer find his father in the fisherman's hut, and asked the\npeople where the poor fisherman could be, and they told him he\nmust not say that, or he would come to the gallows.  Then he\nwent to his father and said, fisherman, how have you got here.\nThen the father said, you must not say that, if the great men\nof the town knew of that, you would come to the gallows.  He,\nhowever, would not give in, and was brought to the gallows.\nWhen he was there, he said, o, my masters, just give me leave to\ngo to the old fisherman's hut.  Then he put on his old smock, and\ncame back to the great men, and said, do you not now see.  Am I\nnot the son of the poor fisherman.  Did I not earn bread for my\nfather and mother in this dress.  Hereupon his father knew him\nagain, and begged his pardon, and took him home with him, and then\nrelated all that had happened to him, and how he had got into a\nforest on a high mountain, and the mountain had opened and he\nhad gone into an enchanted castle, where all was black, and three\nyoung princesses had come to him who were black except a little\nwhite on their faces.  And they had told him not to fear, and\nthat he could rescue them.  Then his mother said that might\nvery likely not be a good thing to do, and that he ought to take\na blessed candle with him, and drop some boiling wax on their\nfaces.\nHe went back again, and he was in great fear, and he dropped\nthe wax on their faces as they were sleeping, and they all\nturned half-white.  Then all the three princesses sprang up, and\nsaid, you accursed dog, our blood shall cry for vengeance on you.\nNow there is no man born in the world, nor will any ever be born\nwho can set us free.  We have still three brothers who are bound\nby seven chains - they shall tear you to pieces.  Then there was\na loud shrieking all over the castle, and he sprang out of the\nwindow, and broke his leg, and the castle sank into the earth\nagain, the mountain closed again, and no one knew where the castle\nhad stood.\n", "Knoist and His Three Sons": "Between werrel and soist there lived a man whose name was knoist,\nand he had three sons.  One was blind, the other lame, and the\nthird stark-naked.  Once on a time they went into a field,\nand there they saw a hare.  The blind one shot it, the lame one\ncaught it, the naked one put it in his pocket.  Then they came to\na mighty big lake, on which there were three boats, one sailed,\none sank, the third had no bottom to it.  They all three got\ninto the one with no bottom to it.  Then they came to a mighty\nbig forest in which there was a mighty big tree, in the tree\nwas a mighty big chapel - in the chapel was a sexton made of\nbeech-wood and a box-wood parson, who dealt out holy water with\ncudgels.\n               How truly happy is that one\n               who can from holy water run.\n", "The Maid of Brakel": "A girl from brakel once went to St. Anne's chapel at the foot\nof the hinnenberg, and as she wanted to have a husband, and\nthought there was no one else in the chapel, she sang,\n               oh, holy saint anne.\n               Help me soon to a man.\n               Thou know'st him right well,\n               by suttmer gate does he dwell,\n               his hair it is yellow,\n               thou know'st him right well.\nThe clerk, however, was standing behind the altar and heard\nthat, so he cried in a very gruff voice, you shall not have him.\nYou shall not have him.\nThe maiden thought that the child mary who stood by her mother\nanne had called out that to her, and was angry, and cried,\nfiddle de dee, conceited thing, hold your tongue, and let your\nmother speak.\n", "Domestic Servants": "Whither do you go.

Their own mother, however, was\ndead, and they had a step-mother who was not kind to them, and\nsecretly did everything she could to hurt them.  It so happened\nthat the two were playing with other children in a meadow before\nthe house, and there was a pond in the meadow which came up\nto one side of the house.  The children ran about it, and caught\neach other, and played at counting out.\n          Eneke beneke, let me live,\n          and I to you my bird will give.\n          The little bird, it straw shall seek,\n          the straw I'll give to the cow to eat.\n          The pretty cow shall give me milk,\n          the milk I'll to the baker take.\n          The baker he shall bake a cake,\n          the cake I'll give unto the cat.\n          The cat shall catch some mice for that,\n          the mice I'll hang up in the smoke,\n          and then you'll see the snow.\nThey stood in a circle while they played this, and the one to\nwhom the word snow fell, had to run away and all the others ran\nafter him and caught him.  As they were running about so merrily\nthe step-mother watched them from the window, and grew angry.\nAnd as she understood arts of witchcraft she bewitched them both,\nand changed the little brother into a fish, and the little sister\ninto a lamb.  Then the fish swam here and there about the pond and\nwas very sad, and the lambkin walked up and down the meadow,\nand was miserable, and could not eat or touch one blade of grass.\nThus\npassed a long time, and then strangers came as visitors to the\ncastle.  The false step-mother thought, this is a good opportunity,\nand called the cook and said to him, go and fetch the lamb from\nthe meadow and kill it, we have nothing else for the visitors.\nThen the cook went away and got the lamb, and took it into the\nkitchen and tied its feet, and all this it bore patiently.  When\nhe had drawn out his knife and was whetting it on the door-step\nto kill the lamb, he noticed a little fish swimming backwards\nand forwards in the water, in front of the gutter-stone and\nlooking up at him.  This, however, was the brother, for when the\nfish saw the cook take the lamb away, it followed them and swam\nalong the pond to the house, then the lamb cried down to it,\n          ah, brother, in the pond so deep,\n          how sad is my poor heart.\n          The cook he whets his knife\n          to take away my life.\nThe little fish answered,\n          ah, little sister, up on high\n          how sad is my poor heart\n          while in this pond I lie.\nWhen the cook heard that the lambkin could speak and said such\nsad words to the fish down below, he was terrified and thought\nthis could be no common lamb, but must be bewitched by the wicked\nwoman in the house.  Then said he, be easy, I will not kill you,\nand took another sheep and made it ready for the guests, and\nconveyed the lambkin to a good peasant woman, to whom he related\nall that he had seen and heard.\nThe peasant, however, was the very woman who had been foster-mother\nto the little sister, and she suspected at once who the\nlamb was, and went with it to a wise woman.  Then the wise woman\npronounced a blessing over the lambkin and the little fish, by\nmeans of which they regained their human forms, and after this\nshe took them both into a little hut in a great forest, where\nthey lived alone, but were contented and happy.\n", "Simeli Mountain": "There were once two brothers, the one rich, the other poor.\nThe rich one, however, gave nothing to the poor one, and he\ngained a scanty living by trading in corn, and often did so\nbadly that he had no bread for his wife and children.  Once\nwhen he was wheeling a barrow through the forest he saw, on\none side of him, a great, bare, naked-looking mountain, and as he\nhad never seen it before, he stood still and stared at it with\namazement.\nWhile he was thus standing he saw twelve great, wild men coming\ntowards him, and as he believed they were robbers he pushed his\nbarrow into the thicket, climbed up a tree, and waited to see\nwhat would happen.  The twelve men, however, went to the\nmountain and cried, semsi mountain, semsi mountain, open up, and\nimmediately the barren mountain opened down the middle, and\nthe twelve went into it, and as soon as they were within, it\nshut.  After a short time, it opened again, and the men came\nforth carrying heavy sacks on their shoulders, and when they\nwere all once more in the daylight they said, semsi mountain,\nsemsi mountain, shut yourself, then the mountain closed\ntogether, and there was no longer any entrance to be seen to it,\nand the twelve went away.\nWhen they were quite out of sight the poor man got down from\nthe tree, and was curious to know what was secretly hidden in\nthe mountain.  So he went up to it and said, semsi mountain,\nsemsi mountain, open up, and the mountain opened up to him also.\nThen he went inside, and the whole mountain was a cavern full of\nsilver and gold, and behind lay great piles of pearls and\nsparkling jewels, heaped up like corn.  The poor man hardly knew\nwhat to do, and whether he might take any of these treasures for\nhimself or not.  At last he filled his pockets with gold, but\nhe left the pearls and precious stones where they were.  When he\ncame out again he also said, semsi mountain, semsi mountain,\nshut yourself, and the mountain closed itself, and he went home\nwith his barrow.\nAnd now he had no more cause for anxiety, but could buy bread\nfor his wife and children with his gold, and wine into the bargain.\nHe lived joyously and honorably, gave help to the poor, and did\ngood to every one.  When the money came to an end, however, he\nwent to his brother, borrowed a measure that held a bushel,\nand brought himself some more, but did not touch any of the\nmost valuable things.  When for the third time he wanted to\nfetch something, he again borrowed the measure of his brother.\nBut the rich man had long been envious of his brother's\npossessions, and of the handsome household which he kept up,\nand could not understand from whence the riches came, and what his\nbrother wanted with the measure.  Then he thought of a cunning\ntrick, and covered the bottom of the measure with pitch, and when\nhe got the measure back a piece of gold was sticking to it.  He\nat once went to his brother and asked him, what have you been\nmeasuring in the bushel measure.  Corn and barley, said the other.\nThen he showed him the piece of gold and threatened that if he did\nnot tell\nthe truth he would accuse him before a court of justice.  The poor\nman then told him everything, just as it had happened.  So the\nrich man ordered his carriage to be made ready, and drove away,\nresolved to use the opportunity better than his brother had\ndone, and to bring back with him quite different treasures.\nWhen he came to the mountain he cried, semsi mountain, semsi\nmountain, open up.  The mountain opened, and he went inside it.\nThere lay the treasures all before him, and for a long time he\ndid not know which to grab first.  At length he loaded himself\nwith as many precious stones as he could carry.  He wished to\ncarry his burden outside, but as his heart and soul were entirely\nfull of the treasures, he had forgotten the name of the mountain,\nand cried, simeli mountain, simeli mountain, open up.  That,\nhowever, was not the right name, and the mountain never stirred,\nbut remained shut.  Then he was alarmed, and the longer he\nthought about it the more his thoughts confused themselves, and\nall his treasures were of no help to him.  In the evening the\nmountain opened, and the twelve robbers came in, and when they\nsaw him they laughed, and cried out, bird, have we caught you\nat last.  Did you think we had never noticed that you had\nbeen in here twice.  We could not catch you then, this third\ntime you shall not get out again.  Then he cried, it was not I,\nit was my brother, but let him beg for his life and say what he\nwould, they cut off his head.\n", "Going A-Travelling": "There was once a poor woman who had a son, who much wished to\ntravel, but his mother said, how can you travel.  We have no money\nat all for you to take away with you.  Then said the son, I will\nmanage very well for myself.  I will always say, not much, not\nmuch, not much.\nSo he walked for a long time and always said, not much, not\nmuch, not much.  Then he passed by a company of fishermen and said,\nGod speed you.  Not much, not much, not much.  What do you say,\nchurl, not much.  And when the net was drawn out they had not\ncaught much fish.  So one of them fell on the youth with a stick and\nsaid, have you never seen me threshing.  What ought I to say,\nthen, asked the youth.  You must say - get it full, get it full.\nAfter this he again walked a long time, and said, get it full, get\nit full, until he came to the gallows, where they had got a poor\nsinner whom they were about to hang.  Then said he, good morning,\nget it full, get it full.  What do you say, knave, get it full.  Do\nyou want to make out that there are still more wicked people\nin the world.  Is not this enough.  And he again got some blows\non his back.  What am I to say, then, said he.  You must say, may\nGod have pity on the poor soul.\nAgain the youth walked on for along while and said, may God have\npity on the poor soul.  Then he came to a pit by which stood a\nknacker who was cutting up a horse.  The youth said, good\nmorning.  God have pity on the poor soul.  What do you say,\nyou ill-tempered knave, and the knacker gave him such a box on\nthe ear, that he could not see out of his eyes.  What am I to say,\nthen.  You must say, let the carrion lie in the pit.\nSo he walked on, and always said, let the carrion lie in the\npit, let the carrion lie in the pit.  And he came to a cart full\nof people, so he said, good morning, let the carrion lie in the\npit.  Then the cart fell into a pit, and the driver took his\nwhip and cracked it upon the youth, till he was forced to crawl\nback to his mother, and as long as he lived he never went out a\ntraveling again.\n", "The Donkey": "Once upon a time there lived a king and a queen, who were rich,\nand had everything they wanted, but no children.  The queen\nlamented over this day and night, and said, I am like a field\non which nothing grows.  At last God gave her her wish, but when\nthe child came into the world, it did not look like a human child,\nbut was a little donkey.  When the mother saw that, her lamentations\nand outcries began in real earnest.  She said she would\nfar rather have had no child at all than have a donkey, and that\nthey were to throw it into the water that the fishes might devour\nit.  But the king said, no, since God has sent him he shall be my\nson and heir, and after my death sit on the royal throne, and\nwear the kingly crown.  The donkey, therefore, was brought up\nand grew bigger, and his ears grew up high and straight.  And he\nwas of a merry disposition, jumped about, played and took especial\npleasure in music, so that he went to a celebrated musician and\nsaid, teach me your art, that I may play the lute as well as you do.\nAh, dear little master, answered the musician, that would come\nvery hard to you, your fingers are not quite suited to it, and\nare far too big.  I am afraid the strings would not last.  But\nno excuses were of any use.  The donkey was determined to play the\nlute.  And since he was persevering and industrious, he at last\nlearnt to do it as well as the master himself.  The young lordling\nonce went out walking full of thought and came to a well.  He\nlooked into it and in the mirror-clear water saw his donkey's\nform.  He was so distressed about it, that he went out into the\nwide world and only took with him one faithful companion.  They\ntraveled up and down, and at last they came into a kingdom where\nand old king reigned who had\na single but wonderfully beautiful daughter.  The donkey said,\nhere we will stay, knocked at the gate, and cried, a guest is\nwithout.  Open, that he may enter.  When the gate was not opened,\nhe sat down, took his lute and played it in the most delightful\nmanner with his two fore-feet.  Then the door-keeper opened his\neyes, and gaped, and ran to the king and said, outside by the\ngate sits a young donkey which plays the lute as well as an\nexperienced master.  Then let the musician come to me, said the\nking.  But when a donkey came in, everyone began to laugh at the\nlute-player.  And when the donkey was asked to sit down and eat\nwith the servants, he was unwilling, and said, I am no common\nstable-ass, I\nam a noble one.  Then they said, if that is what you are, seat\nyourself with the soldiers.  No, said he, I will sit by the king.\nThe king smiled, and said good-humoredly, yes, it shall be as\nyou will, little ass, come here to me.  Then he asked, little ass,\nhow does my daughter please you.  The donkey turned his head\ntowards her, looked at her, nodded and said, I like her above\nmeasure, I have never yet seen anyone so beautiful as she is.\nWell, then, you shall sit next her too, said the king.  That is\nexactly what I wish, said the donkey, and he placed himself by her\nside, ate and drank, and knew how to behave himself daintily\nand cleanly.  When the noble beast had stayed a long time at the\nking's court, he thought, what good does all this do me, I\nshall still have to go home again, let his head hang sadly,\nand went to the king and asked for his dismissal.  But the king\nhad grown fond of him, and said, little ass, what ails you.  You\nlook as sour as a jug of vinegar, I will give you what you want.\nDo you want gold.  No, said the donkey, and shook his head.\nDo you want jewels and rich dress.  No.  Do you wish for half my\nkingdom.  Indeed, no.  Then said the king, if I did but know what\nwould make you content.  Will you have my pretty daughter to wife.\nAh, yes, said the ass, I should indeed like her, and all at once\nhe became quite merry and full of happiness, for that was exactly\nwhat he was wishing for.  So a great and splendid wedding was\nheld.  In the evening, when the bride and bridegroom were led\ninto their bed-room, the king wanted to know if the ass would\nbehave well, and ordered a servant to hide himself there.  When\nthey were both within, the bridegroom bolted the door, looked\naround, and as he believed that they were quite alone, he suddenly\nthrew off his ass's skin, and stood there in the form of a handsome\nroyal youth.  Now, said he, you see who I am, and see also that\nI am not unworthy of you.  Then the bride was glad, and kissed\nhim, and loved him dearly.  When morning came, he jumped up, put\nhis animal's skin on again, and no one could have guessed\nwhat kind of a form was hidden beneath it.  Soon came the old king.\nAh, cried he, so the little ass is already up.  But surely you are\nsad, said he to his daughter, that you have not got a proper\nman for your husband.  Oh, no, dear father, I love him as well as\nif he were the handsomest in the world, and I will keep him as long\nas I live.  The king was surprised, but the servant who had\nconcealed himself came and revealed everything to him.  The king\nsaid, that cannot be true.  Then watch yourself the next night,\nand you will see it with your own eyes, and hark you, lord king,\nif you were to take his skin away and throw it in the fire, he\nwould be forced to show himself in his true shape.  Your advice is\ngood, said the king, and at night when they were asleep, he stole\nin, and when he got to the bed he saw by the light of the moon\na noble-looking youth lying there, and the skin lay stretched on\nthe ground.  So he took it away, and had a great fire lighted\noutside, and threw the skin into it, and remained by it himself\nuntil it was all burnt to ashes.  But since he was anxious to know\nhow the robbed man would behave himself, he stayed awake the whole\nnight and watched.  When the youth had slept his fill, he got\nup by the first light of morning, and wanted to put on the\nass's skin, but it was not to be found.  At this he was alarmed,\nand, full of grief and anxiety, said, now I shall have to contrive\nto escape.  But when he went out, there stood the king, who said,\nmy son, whither away in such haste.  What have you in mind.  Stay\nhere, you are such a handsome man, you shall not go away from me.\nI will now give you half my kingdom, and after my death you shall\nhave the whole of it.  Then I hope that what begins so well may\nend well, and I will stay with you, said the youth.  And the old\nman gave him half the kingdom, and in a year's time, when he died,\nthe youth had the whole, and after the death of his father he had\nanother kingdom as well, and lived in all magnificence.\n", "The Ungrateful Son": "A man and his wife were once sitting by the door of their house,\nand they had a roasted chicken set before them, and were about\nto eat it together.  Then the man saw that his aged father was\ncoming, and hastily took the chicken and hid it, for he would\nnot permit him to have any of it.  The old man came, took a drink,\nand went away.  Now the son wanted to put the roasted chicken on\nthe table again, but when he took it up, it had become a great\ntoad, which jumped into his face and sat there and never went\naway again, and if any one wanted to take it off, it looked\nvenomously at him as if it would jump in his face, so that no\none would venture to touch it.  And the ungrateful son was forced\nto feed the toad every day, or else it fed itself on his face,\nand thus he went about the world knowing no rest.\n", "The Old Man Made Young Again": "At the time when our Lord still walked this earth, he and St.\nPeter stopped one evening at a smith's and received free\nquarters.  Then it came to pass that a poor beggar, hard pressed\nby age and infirmity, came to this house and begged alms of the\nsmith.  St. Peter had compassion on him and said, Lord and\nmaster, if it please you, cure his torments that he may be able\nto win his own bread.  The Lord said kindly, smith, lend me your\nforge, and put on some coals for me, and then I will make this\nailing old man young again.  The smith was quite willing, and\nSt. Peter blew the bellows, and when the coal fire sparkled up\nlarge and high our Lord took the little old man, pushed him in\nthe forge in the midst of the red-hot fire, so that he glowed like\na rose-bush, and praised God with a loud voice.  After that the\nLord went to the quenching tub, put the glowing little man into\nit so that the water closed over\nhim, and after he had carefully cooled him, gave him his blessing,\nwhen behold the little man sprang nimbly out, looking fresh,\nstraight, healthy, and as if he were but twenty.  The smith, who\nhad watched everything closely and attentively, invited them\nall to supper.  He, however, had an old half-blind crooked,\nmother-in-law who went to the youth, and with great earnestness\nasked if the fire had burnt him much.  He answered that he had never\nfelt more comfortable, and that he had sat in the red heat\nas if he had been in cool dew.  The youth's words echoed in the\nears of the old woman all night long, and early next morning,\nwhen the Lord had gone on his way again and had heartily thanked\nthe smith, the latter thought he might make his old mother-in-law\nyoung again likewise, as he had watched everything so carefully,\nand it lay in the province of his trade.  So he called to ask her\nif she, too, would like to go bounding about like a girl of\neighteen.  She said, with all my heart, as the youth has come\nout of it so well.  So the smith made a great fire, and thrust\nthe old woman into it, and she writhed about this way and that,\nand uttered terrible cries of murder.  Sit still.  Why are\nyou screaming and jumping about so, cried he, and as he spoke\nhe blew the bellows again until all her rags were burnt.  The\nold woman cried without ceasing, and the smith thought to himself,\nI have not quite the right art, and took her out and threw her\ninto the cooling-tub.  Then she screamed so loudly that the smith's\nwife upstairs and her daughter-in-law heard it, and they both\nran downstairs, and saw the old woman lying in a heap in the\nquenching-tub, howling and screaming, with her face wrinkled and\nshriveled and all out of shape.  Thereupon the two, who were\nboth with child, were so terrified that that very night two\nboys were born who were not made like men but apes, and they ran\ninto the woods, and from them sprang the race of apes.\n", "The Three Sluggards": "A certain king had three sons who were all equally dear to\nhim, and he did not know which of them to appoint as his successor\nafter his own death.  When the time came when he was about to\ndie, he summoned them to his bedside and said, dear children,\nI have been thinking of something which I will declare unto\nyou, whichsoever of you is the laziest shall have the kingdom.\nThe eldest said, then, father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so\nidle that if I lie down to rest, and a drop falls in my eye,\nI will not open it that I may sleep.  The second said, father,\nthe kingdom belongs to me, for I am so idle that when I am\nsitting by the fire warming myself, I would rather let my heel\nbe burnt off than draw back my leg.  The third said, father,\nthe kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I were going to\nbe hanged, and had the rope already round my neck, and any one\nput a sharp knife into my hand with which I might cut the rope,\nI would rather let myself be hanged than raise my hand to the rope.\nWhen the father heard that, he said, you have carried it the\nfarthest, and shall be king.\n", "The Shepherd Boy": "There was once upon a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread\nfar and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every\nquestion.  The king of the country heard of it likewise, but\ndid not believe it, and sent for the boy.  Then he said to\nhim, if you can give me an answer to three questions which I\nwill ask you, I will look on you as my own child, and you shall\ndwell with me in my royal palace.  The boy said, what are the\nthree questions.  The king said, the first is, how many drops\nof water are there in the ocean.  The shepherd boy answered, lord\nking, if you will have all the rivers on earth dammed up so that\nnot a single drop runs from them into the sea until I have\ncounted it, I will tell you how many drops there are in the sea.\nThe king said, the next question is, how many stars are there\nin the sky.  The shepherd boy said, give me a great sheet of\nwhite paper, and then he made so many fine points on it with a\npen that they could\nscarcely be seen, and it was all but impossible to count them,\nany one who looked at them would have lost his sight.  Then he\nsaid, there are as many stars in the sky as there are points\non the paper.  Just count them.  But no one was able to do it.\nThe king said, the third question is, how many seconds of time\nare there in eternity.  Then said the shepherd boy, in\nlower pomerania is the diamond mountain, which is two miles\nhigh, two miles wide, and two miles deep.  Every hundred\nyears a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it, and\nwhen the whole mountain is worn away by this, then the first\nsecond of eternity will be over.\nThe king said, you have answered the three questions like a\nwise man, and shall henceforth dwell with me in my royal\npalace, and I will regard you as my own child.\n", "The Star-Money": "There was once upon a time a little girl whose father and mother\nwere dead, and she was so poor that she no longer had a room to\nlive in, or bed to sleep in, and at last she had nothing else but\nthe clothes she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her\nhand which some charitable soul had given her.  She was good and\npious, however.  And as she was thus forsaken by all the world,\nshe went forth into the open country, trusting in the good God.\nThen a poor man met her, who said, ah, give me something to eat,\nI am so hungry.  She handed him the whole of her piece of bread,\nand said, may God bless you, and went onwards.  Then came a child\nwho moaned and said, my head is so cold, give me something to\ncover it with.  So she took off her hood and gave it to him.  And\nwhen she had walked a little farther, she met another child who\nhad no jacket and was frozen with cold.  Then she gave it her\nown, and a little farther on one begged for a frock,\nand she gave away that also.  At length she got into a forest\nand it had already become dark, and there came yet another child,\nand asked for a shirt, and the good little girl thought\nto herself, it is a dark night and no one sees you, you can very\nwell give your shirt away, and took it off, and gave away that\nalso.  And as she so stood, and had not one single thing left,\nsuddenly some stars from heaven fell down, and they were nothing\nelse but hard smooth pieces of money, and although she had just\ngiven her shirt away, she had a new one which was of the very\nfinest linen.  Then she put the money into it, and was rich all\nthe days of her life.\n", "The Stolen Farthings": "A father was one day sitting at dinner with his wife and his\nchildren, and a good friend who had come on a visit ate with\nthem.  And as they thus sat, and it was striking twelve o'clock,\nthe stranger saw the door open, and a very pale child dressed\nin snow-white clothes came in.  It did not look around, and it\ndid not speak, but went straight into the next room.  Soon\nafterwards it came back, and went out at the door again in the\nsame quiet manner.  On the second and on the third day, it came\nalso exactly in the same way.  At last the stranger asked the\nfather to whom the beautiful child that went into the next room\nevery day at noon belonged.  I have never seen it, said he,\nneither did he know to whom it could belong.  The next day when\nit again came, the stranger pointed it out to the father, who\nhowever did not see it, and the mother and the children also\nall saw nothing.  At this the stranger got up, went to the room\ndoor, opened it a little, and peeped in.  Then he saw the child\nsitting on the ground, and busily digging and seeking about\nbetween the boards of the floor, but\nwhen it saw the stranger, it disappeared.  He now told what\nhe had seen and described the child exactly, and the mother\nrecognized it, and said, ah, it is my dear child who died a\nmonth ago.  They took up the boards and found two farthings\nwhich the child had once received from its mother that it\nmight give them to a poor man.  It, however, had thought, you\ncan buy yourself a biscuit for that, and had kept the farthings,\nand hidden them in the openings between the boards.  And therefore\nit had had no rest in its grave, and had come every day at noon\nto seek for these farthings.  The parents gave the money at\nonce to a poor man, and after that the child was never seen again.\n", "Brides on Their Trial": "There was once a young shepherd who wanted very much to marry,\nand was acquainted with three sisters who were all equally pretty,\nso that it was difficult for him to make a choice, and he could\nnot decide to give the preference to any one of them.  Then he\nasked his mother for advice, and she said, invite all three,\nand set some cheese before them, and watch how they eat it.  The\nyouth did so, the first swallowed the cheese with the rind on,\nthe second hastily cut the rind off the cheese, but she cut\nit so quickly that she left much good cheese with it, and threw\nthat away also, the third peeled the rind off carefully, and cut\nneither too much nor too little.  The shepherd told all this to\nhis mother, who said, take the third for your wife.  This he did,\nand lived contentedly and happily with her.\n", "The Sparrow and His Four Children": "A sparrow had four young ones in a swallow's nest.  When they\nwere fledged, some naughty boys pulled out the nest, but\nfortunately all the birds got safely away in the high wind.  Then\nthe old bird was grieved that as his sons had all gone out into\nthe world, he had not first warned them of every kind of danger,\nand given them good instruction how to deal with each.\nIn the autumn a great many sparrows assembled together in a\nwheatfield, and there the old bird met his four children again,\nand full of joy took them home with him.  Ah, my dear sons, how\nI have been worrying about you all through the summer, because you\ngot away in the wind without my teaching.  Listen to my words,\nobey your father, and be well on your guard.  Little birds have\nto encounter great dangers.  And then he asked the eldest where\nhe had spent the summer, and how he had supported himself.  I\nstayed in the gardens, and looked for caterpillars and small worms,\nuntil the cherries were ripe.  Ah, my son, said the father,\ntit-bits\nare not bad, but there is great risk about them.  On that account\ntake great care of yourself henceforth, and particularly when\npeople are going about the gardens who carry long green poles\nwhich are hollow inside and have a little hole at the top.  Yes,\nfather, but what if a little green leaf is stuck over the hole\nwith wax, said the son.  Where have you seen that.  In a\nmerchant's garden, said the youngster.  Oh, my son, merchant folks\nare smart folks, said the father.  If you have been among the\nchildren of the world, you have learned worldly craftiness enough,\nonly see that you use it well, and do not be too confident.\nThen he asked the next, where have you passed your time.  At\ncourt, said the son.  Sparrows and silly little birds are of\nno use in that place.  There one finds much gold, velvet, silk,\narmor, harnesses, sparrow-hawks, screech-owls and lanners.  Keep\nto the horses, stable where they winnow oats, or thresh, and\nthen fortune may give you your daily grain of corn in peace.  Yes,\nfather, said the son, but when the stable-boys make traps and fix\ntheir gins and snares in the straw, many a one is caught.\nWhere have you seen that, said the old bird.  At court, among the\nstable-boys.  Oh, my son, court boys are bad boys.  If you\nhave been to court and among the lords, and have left no feathers\nthere, you have learnt a fair amount, and will know very well\nhow to go about the world, but look around you and above you,\nfor the wolves often devour the wisest dogs.\nThe father examined the third also, where did you seek your\nfortune.  I have cast my tub and rope on the cart-roads and\nhighways, and sometimes met with a grain of corn or barley.  That\nis indeed dainty fare, said the father, but take care what you\nare about and look carefully around, especially when you see\nanyone stooping and about to pick up a stone, for then\nyou have not much time to waste.  That is true, said the son,\nbut what if anyone should carry a bit of rock, or ore, ready\nbeforehand in his breast or pocket.  Where have you seen that.\nAmong the miners, dear father.  When they get out of the pit,\nthey generally take little bits of ore with them.  Mining folks\nare working folks, and clever folks.\nIf you have been among mining lads, you have seen and learnt\nsomething, but when you go thither beware, for many a sparrow\nhas been brought to a bad end by a mining boy throwing a piece\nof cobalt.\nAt length the father came to the youngest son, you, my dear\nchirping nestling, were always the silliest and weakest.  Stay\nwith me, the world has many rough, wicked birds which have\ncrooked beaks and long claws, and lie in wait for poor little\nbirds and swallow them.  Keep with those of your own kind, and\npick up little spiders and caterpillars from the trees, or the\nhouses, and then you will live long in peace.  My dear father,\nhe who feeds himself without injury to other people fares well,\nand no sparrow-hawk, eagle, or kite will hurt him if he commits\nhimself and his lawful food, evening and morning, faithfully to\nGod, who is the creator and preserver of all forest and village\nbirds, who likewise heareth the cry and prayer of the young\nravens, for no sparrow or wren ever falls to the ground except\nby his will.  Where have you learnt this.  The son answered,\nwhen the great blast of wind tore me away from you I came to a\nchurch, and there during the summer I have picked up the flies\nand spiders from the windows, and heard this discourse preached.\nThe father of all sparrows fed me all the\nsummer through, and kept me from all misfortune and from\nferocious birds.  Indeed, my dear son, if you take refuge in\nthe churches and help to clear away spiders and buzzing flies,\nand chirp unto God like the young ravens, and commend\nyourself to the eternal creator, all will be well with you,\nand that even if the whole world were full of wild malicious birds.\n               He who to God commits his ways,\n               in silence suffers, waits, and prays,\n               preserves his faith and conscience pure,\n               he is of God's protection sure.\n", "The Glass Coffin": "Let no one ever say that a poor tailor cannot do great things\nand win high honors.  All that is needed is that he should go to\nthe right smithy, and what is of most consequence, that he\nshould have good luck.  A civil, smart tailor's apprentice\nonce went out traveling, and came into a great forest, and,\nas he did not know the way, he lost himself.  Night fell and\nnothing was left for him to do in this painful solitude, but to\nseek a bed.  He might certainly have found a good bed on the\nsoft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest\nthere, and at last he made up his mind to spend the night in\na tree.  He sought out a high oak, climbed up to the top of it,\nand thanked God that he had his goose with him, for otherwise\nthe wind which blew over the top of the tree would have carried\nhim away.\nAfter he had spent some hours in the darkness, not without fear\nand trembling, he saw at a very short distance the glimmer of a\nlight, and as he thought that a human habitation might be there,\nwhere he would be better off than on the branches of a tree, he\ngot carefully down and went towards the light.  It guided him\nto a small hut that was woven together of reeds and rushes.  He\nknocked\nboldly, the door opened, and by the light which came forth he saw\na little hoary old man who wore a coat made of bits of colored\nstuff sewn together.  Who are you, and what do you want, asked\nthe man in a grumbling voice.  I am a poor tailor, he answered,\nwhom night has surprised here in the wilderness, and I earnestly\nbeg you to take me into your hut until morning.  Go your way,\nreplied the old man in a surly voice, I will have nothing to do\nwith tramps, seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere.  Having said\nthis, he was about to slip into his hut again, but the tailor\nheld him so tightly by the corner of his coat, and pleaded so\npiteously, that the old man, who was not so ill-natured as he\nwished to appear, was at last softened, and took him into the\nhut with him where he gave him something to eat, and then offered\nhim a very good bed in a corner.\nThe weary tailor needed no rocking, but slept sweetly till morning,\nbut even then would not have thought of getting up, if he had\nnot been aroused by a great noise.  A violent sound of screaming\nand roaring forced its way through the thin walls of the hut.\nThe tailor, full of unwonted courage, jumped up, put his clothes\non in haste, and hurried out.  Then close by the hut, he saw\na great black bull and a beautiful stag, which were just\npreparing for a violent struggle.  They rushed at each other with\nsuch extreme rage that the ground shook with their trampling,\nand the air resounded with their cries.  For a long time it\nwas uncertain which of the two would gain the victory, at\nlength the stag thrust his horns into his adversary's body,\nwhereupon the bull fell to the earth with a terrific roar, and\nwas finished off by a few strokes from the stag.\nThe tailor, who had watched the fight with astonishment, was\nstill standing there motionless, when the stag in full career\nbounded up to him, and before he could escape, caught him up\non his great horns.  He had not much time to collect his thoughts,\nfor it went in a swift race over stock and stone, mountain and\nvalley, wood and meadow.  He held with both hands to the ends\nof the horns, and resigned himself to his fate.  It seemed\nto him just as if he were flying away.  At length the stag\nstopped in front of a wall of rock, and gently let the tailor\ndown.  The tailor, more dead than alive, required\nsome time to come to himself.  When he had in some degree\nrecovered, the stag, which had remained standing by him, pushed\nits horns with such force against a door in the rock, that\nit sprang open.  Flames of fire shot forth, after which followed\na great smoke, which hid the stag from his sight.  The tailor\ndid not know what to do, or whither to turn, in order to get\nout of this desert and back to human beings again.  Whilst\nhe was standing thus undecided, a voice sounded out of the rock,\nwhich cried to him, enter without fear, no evil shall befall you.\nHe hesitated, but driven by a mysterious force, he obeyed the\nvoice and went through the iron-door into a large spacious\nhall, whose ceiling, walls and floor were made of shining polished\nsquare stones, on each of which were carved signs which were\nunknown to him.  He looked at everything full of admiration,\nand was on the point of going out again, when he once more\nheard the voice which said to him, step on the stone\nwhich lies in the middle of the hall, and great good fortune\nawaits you.\nHis courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order.\nThe stone began to give way under his feet, and sank slowly down\ninto the depths.  When it was once more firm, and the tailor looked\nround, he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the\nformer.  Here, however, there was more to look at and to admire.\nHollow places were cut in the walls, in which stood vases of\ntransparent glass and filled with colored spirit or with a\nbluish vapor.  On the floor of the hall two great glass chests\nstood opposite to each other, which at once excited his curiosity.\nWhen he went to one of them he saw inside it a handsome structure\nlike a castle surrounded by farm-buildings, stables and barns,\nand a quantity of other good things.  Everything was small, but\nexceedingly carefully and delicately made, and seemed to be\ncarved out by a dexterous hand with the greatest precision.\nHe might not have turned away his eyes from the consideration\nof this rarity for some time, had not the voice once more made\nitself heard.  It ordered him to turn round and look at the\nglass chest which was standing opposite.  How his admiration\nincreased when\nhe saw therein a maiden of the greatest beauty.  She lay as if\nasleep, and was wrapped in her long fair hair as in a\nprecious mantle.  Her eyes were closely shut, but the brightness\nof her complexion and a ribbon which her breathing moved to\nand fro, left no doubt that she was alive.  The tailor was\nlooking at the beauty with beating heart, when she suddenly\nopened her eyes, and started up at the sight of him with a shock\nof joy.  Divine providence, cried she, my deliverance is\nat hand.  Quick, quick, help me out of my prison.  If you\npush back the bolt of this glass coffin, then I shall be free.\nThe tailor obeyed without delay, and she immediately raised up\nthe glass lid, came out and hastened into the corner of the hall,\nwhere she covered herself with a large cloak.  Then she seated\nherself on a\nstone, ordered the young man to come to her, and after she had\nimprinted a friendly kiss on his lips, she said, my long-desired\ndeliverer, kind heaven has guided you to me, and put an end\nto my sorrows.  On the self-same day when they end, shall your\nhappiness begin.  You are the husband chosen for me by heaven, and\nshall pass your life in unbroken joy, loved by me, and rich to\noverflowing in every earthly possession.  Seat yourself, and\nlisten to the story of my life.\nI am the daughter of a rich count.  My parents died when I was\nstill in my tender youth, and recommended me in their last will\nto my elder brother, by whom I was brought up.  We loved each\nother so tenderly, and were so alike in our way of thinking\nand our inclinations, that we both embraced the resolution\nnever to marry, but to stay together to the end of our lives.\nIn our house there was no lack of company.  Neighbors and friends\nvisited us often, and we showed the greatest hospitality to\nevery one.  So it came to pass one evening that a stranger came\nriding to our castle, and, under pretext of not being able to\nget on to the next place, begged for shelter for the night.\nWe granted his request with ready courtesy, and he entertained us\nin the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation\nintermingled with stories.  My brother liked the stranger so\nmuch that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us, to\nwhich, after some hesitation, he consented.  We did not rise\nfrom table until late in the night, the stranger was shown to\na room, and I hastened, as I was tired, to lay my limbs in\nmy soft bed.  Hardly had I fallen off to sleep, when the sound\nof faint and delightful music awoke me.  As I could not\nconceive from whence it came, I wanted to summon my waiting-maid\nwho slept in the next room, but to my astonishment I found that\nspeech was taken away from me by an unknown force.  I felt as if\na nightmare were weighing down my breast, and was unable to make\nthe very slightest sound.  In the meantime, by the light of\nmy night-lamp, I saw the stranger enter my room through two\ndoors which were fast bolted.  He came to me and said, that\nby magic arts which were at his command, he had caused the\nlovely music to sound in order to awaken me, and\nthat he now forced his way through all fastenings with the\nintention of offering his hand and heart.  My dislike of his\nmagic arts was so great, however, that I refused to answer him.\nHe remained for a time standing without moving, apparently with\nthe idea of waiting for a favorable decision, but as I continued\nto keep silence, he angrily declared he would revenge himself\nand find means to punish my pride, and left the room.  I\npassed the night in the greatest disquietude, and fell asleep\nonly towards morning.  When I awoke, I hurried to my brother, but\ndid not find him in his room, and the attendants told me that he\nhad ridden forth with the stranger to the chase at daybreak.\n\nI at once suspected nothing good.  I dressed myself quickly,\nordered my palfrey to be saddled, and accompanied only by one\nservant, rode full gallop to the forest.  The servant fell with\nhis horse, and could not follow me, for the horse had broken its\nfoot.  I pursued my way without halting, and in a few minutes\nI saw the stranger coming towards me with a beautiful stag which\nhe led by a cord.  I asked him where he had left my brother, and\nhow he had come by this stag, out of whose great eyes I saw\ntears flowing.  Instead of answering me, he began to laugh\nloudly.  I fell into a great rage at this, pulled out a pistol\nand discharged it at the monster, but the ball rebounded from\nhis breast and went into my horse's head.  I fell to the ground,\nand the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of\nconsciousness.\nWhen I came to my senses again I found myself in this underground\ncave in a glass coffin.  The magician appeared once again, and\nsaid he had changed my brother into a stag, my castle with all\nthat belonged to it, diminished in size by his arts, he had\nshut up in the other glass chest, and my people, who were all\nturned into smoke, he had confined in glass bottles.  He\ntold me that if I would now comply with his wish, it would be an\neasy thing for him to put everything back in its former state, as\nhe had nothing to do but open the vessels, and everything would\nreturn once more to its natural form.  I answered him as little\nas I had done the first time.  He vanished and left me in my\nprison, in which a deep sleep came on me.\nAmong the visions which passed before my eyes, the most\ncomforting was that in which a young man came and set me free,\nand when I opened my eyes to-day I saw you, and beheld my\ndream fulfilled.  Help me to accomplish the other things\nwhich happened in those visions.  The first is that we lift the\nglass chest in which my castle is enclosed, on to that broad stone.\nAs soon as the stone was laden, it began to rise up on high with\nthe maiden and the young man, and mounted through the opening\nof the ceiling into the upper hall, from whence they then could\neasily reach the open air.  Here the maiden opened the lid, and\nit was marvellous to behold how the castle, the houses, and\nthe farm buildings which were enclosed, stretched themselves out\nand grew to their natural size with the greatest rapidity.\nAfter this, the maiden and the tailor returned to the cave beneath\nthe earth, and had the vessels which were filled with smoke\ncarried up by the stone.  The maiden had scarcely opened the\nbottles when the blue smoke rushed out and changed itself into\nliving men, in whom she recognized her servants and her people.\nHer joy was still more increased when her brother, who had\nkilled the magician in the form of the bull, came out of the\nforest towards them in his human form, and on the self-same day\nthe maiden, in accordance with her promise, gave her hand at the\naltar to the lucky tailor.\n", "Lazy Harry": "Harry was lazy, and although he had nothing else to do but\ndrive his goat daily to pasture, he nevertheless groaned\nwhen he went home after his day's work was done.  It is indeed\na heavy burden, said he, and a wearisome employment to drive\na goat into the field this way year after year, till late into\nthe autumn.  If one could but lie down and sleep, but no, one\nmust have\none's eyes open lest the goat hurts the young trees, or squeezes\nitself through the hedge into a garden, or runs away altogether.\nHow can one have any rest, or enjoy one's life.  He seated\nhimself, collected his thoughts, and considered how he could\nset his shoulders free from this burden.  For a long time all\nthinking was to no purpose, but suddenly it was as if scales\nfell from his eyes.  I know what I will do, he cried, I will\nmarry fat trina who has also a goat, and can take mine out with\nhers, and then I shall have no more need to trouble myself.\nSo harry got up, set his weary legs in motion, and went right\nacross the street, for it was no farther, to where the parents of\nfat trina lived, and asked for their industrious and virtuous\ndaughter in marriage.  The parents did not reflect long.  Birds\nof a feather, flock together, they thought, and consented.\nSo fat trina became harry's wife, and led out both the goats.\nHarry had a good time of it, and had no work that he required to\nrest from but his own idleness.  He went out with her only now\nand then, and said, I merely do it that I may afterwards enjoy\nrest more, otherwise one loses all feeling for it.\nBut fat trina was no less idle.  Dear harry, said she one day,\nwhy should we make our lives so toilsome when there is no need\nfor it, and thus ruin the best days of our youth.  Would it not\nbe better for us to give the two goats which disturb us every\nmorning in our sweetest sleep with their bleating, to our\nneighbor, and he will give us a beehive for them.  We will put\nthe beehive in a sunny place behind the house, and trouble\nourselves no more about it.  Bees do not require to be taken\ncare of, or driven into the field.  They fly out and find the way\nhome again for themselves, and collect honey without giving the\nvery least trouble.  You have spoken like a sensible woman,\nreplied harry.  We will carry out your proposal without delay,\nand besides all that, honey tastes better and nourishes one\nbetter than goat's milk, and it can be kept longer too.\nThe neighbor willingly gave a beehive for the two goats.  The\nbees flew in and out from early morning till late evening\nwithout ever tiring, and filled the hive with the most beautiful\nhoney, so\nthat in autumn harry was able to take a whole pitcherful out of\nit.\nThey placed the jug on a board which was fixed to the wall of\ntheir bed-room, and as they were afraid that it might be stolen,\nor that the mice might find it, trina brought in a stout\nhazel-stick and put it beside her bed, so that without\nunnecessary motion she might reach it with her hand, and drive\naway the uninvited guests.\nLazy harry did not like to leave his bed before noon.  He who\nrises early, said he, wastes his substance.  One morning when\nhe was still lying amongst the feathers in broad daylight,\nresting after his long sleep, he said to his wife, women are\nfond of sweet things, and you are always tasting the honey in\nprivate.  It will be better for us to exchange it for a goose\nwith a young gosling, before you eat up the whole of it.  But,\nanswered trina, not before we have a child to take care of them.\nAm I to worry myself with the little geese, and spend all my\nstrength on them to no purpose.  Do you think, said harry, that\nthe youngster will look after geese.  Now-a-days children no\nlonger obey, they do according to their own fancy, because they\nconsider themselves cleverer than their parents, just like\nthat lad who was sent to seek the cow and chased three blackbirds.\nOh, replied trina, this one shall fare badly if he does not do\nwhat I say.  I will take a stick and belabor his skin with more\nblows than I can count.  Look, harry, cried she in her zeal, and\nseized the stick with which she used to drive the mice away, look,\nthis is the way I will fall on him.  She reached her arm out\nto strike, but unhappily hit the honey-pitcher above the bed.\nThe pitcher struck against the wall and fell down in shards,\nand the fine honey streamed out on the ground.  There lie the\ngoose and the young gosling, said\nharry, and want no looking after.  But it is lucky that the\npitcher did not fall on my head.  We have all reason to be\nsatisfied with our lot.  And then as he saw that there was still\nsome honey in one of the shards he stretched out his hand for\nit, and said quite gaily, the remains, my wife, we will still\neat with relish, and we will rest a little after the fright we\nhave had.  What does it matter if we do get up a little later.\nThe day is always long enough.  Yes, answered trina, we shall\nalways get to the end of it at the proper time.  You know, the\nsnail was once asked to a wedding and set out to go, but arrived\nat the christening.  In front of the house it fell over the\nfence, and said, speed does no good.\n", "The Griffin": "There was once upon a time a king, but where he reigned and what\nhe was called, I do not know.  He had no son, but an only daughter\nwho had always been ill, and no doctor had been able to cure her.\nThen it was foretold to the king that his daughter would find her\nhealth by eating an apple.  So he ordered it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the whole of his kingdom, that whosoever brought his\ndaughter an apple with which she could find her health, should\nhave her to wife, and be king.  This became known to a peasant\nwho had three sons, and he said to the eldest, go out into the\ngarden and take a basketful of those beautiful apples with\nthe red cheeks and carry them to the court, perhaps the king's\ndaughter will be able to find her health with them, and then you\nwill marry her and be king.  The lad did so, and set out.  When\nhe had gone a short way he met a hoary little man who asked him\nwhat he had there in the basket, to which replied uele for so was\nhe named, frogs, legs.  At this the little man said, well, so\nshall it be, and remain, and went away.  At length uele arrived at\nthe palace, and made it known that he had brought apples which\nwould cure the king's daughter if she ate them.  This delighted the\nking hugely, and he caused uele to be brought before him, but,\nalas.  When he opened the basket, instead of having apples in it he\nhad frogs, legs which were still kicking about.  On this the king\ngrew angry, and had him driven out of the house.  When he got home\nhe told his father how it had fared with him.  Then the father\nsent the next son, who was called same, but all went with him just\nas it had gone with uele.  He also met the hoary little man,\nwho asked what he had there in the basket.  Same said, hogs,\nbristles, and the hoary man said, well, so shall it be, and remain.\nWhen same got to the king's palace and said he brought apples with\nwhich the king's daughter might find her health, they did not\nwant to let him go in, and said that one fellow had already been\nthere, and had treated them as if they were fools.  Same, however,\nmaintained that he certainly had the apples, and that they ought\nto let him go in.  At length they believed him, and led him to the\nking.  But when he uncovered the basket, he had but hogs, bristles.\nThis enraged the king most terribly, so he caused same to be whipped\nout of the house.  When he got home he related all that had befallen\nhim, whereupon the youngest boy, whose name was Hans, but who was\nalways called stupid Hans, came and asked his father if he might\ngo with some apples.  Oh, said the father, you would be just the\nright fellow for such a thing.  If the clever one can't manage it,\nwhat can you do.  The boy, however, insisted and said, indeed,\nfather, I wish to go.  Just get away, you stupid fellow, you must\nwait till you are wiser, said the father to that, and turned his\nback.  Hans, however, pulled at the back of his smock and\nsaid, indeed, father, I wish to go.  Well, then, so far as I am\nconcerned you may go, but you will soon come home again, replied\nthe old man in a spiteful voice.  The boy was tremendously delighted\nand jumped for joy.  Well, act like a fool.  You grow more stupid\nevery day, said the father again.  But Hans was not discouraged, and\ndid not let it spoil his pleasure, but as it was then night, he\nthought he might as well wait until the morrow, for he could\nnot get to court that day.  All night long he could not sleep in his\nbed, and if he did doze for a moment, he dreamt of beautiful\nmaidens, of palaces, of gold, and of silver, and all kinds of things\nof that sort.  Early in the morning, he went forth on his way, and\ndirectly afterwards the little shabby-looking man in his icy\nclothes, came to him and asked what he was carrying in the basket.\nHans gave him the answer that he was carrying apples with which the\nking's daughter was to find her health.  Then, said the little man,\nso shall they be, and remain.  But at the court they would none of\nthem let Hans go in, for they said two had already been there who\nhad told them that they were bringing apples, and one of them had\nfrogs, legs, and the other hogs, bristles.  Hans, however,\nresolutely maintained that he most certainly had no frogs, legs,\nbut some of the most beautiful apples in the whole kingdom.  As he\nspoke so pleasantly, the door-keeper thought he could not be\ntelling a lie, and asked him to go in, and he was right, for when\nHans uncovered his basket in the king's presence, golden-yellow\napples came tumbling out.  The king was delighted, and caused some\nof them to be\ntaken to his daughter, and then waited in anxious expectation until\nnews should be brought to him of the effect they had.  But\nbefore much time had passed by, news was brought to him.  And who\ndo you think it was who came.  It was the daughter herself.  As\nsoon as she had eaten of those apples, she was cured, and sprang\nout of her bed.  The joy the king felt cannot be described.  But\nnow he did not want to give his daughter in marriage to Hans, and\nsaid he must first make him a boat which would go quicker on dry\nland than on water.  Hans agreed to the condition, and went home,\nand related how it had fared with him.  Then the father sent\nuele into\nthe forest to make a boat of that kind.  He worked diligently,\nand whistled all the time.  At mid-day, when the sun was at\nits highest, came the little icy man and asked what he was making.\nUele gave him for answer, wooden bowls for the kitchen.  The\nicy man said, so it shall be, and remain.  By evening uele\nthought he had now made the boat, but when he wanted to get\ninto it, he had nothing but wooden bowls.  The next day same\nwent into the forest, but everything went with him just as it\nhad done with uele.  On the third day stupid Hans went.  He worked\naway most industriously, so that the whole forest resounded\nwith the heavy blows, and all the while he sang and whistled\nright merrily.  At mid-day, when it was the hottest, the little\nman came again, and asked what he was making.  A boat which will\ngo quicker on dry land than on water, replied Hans, and when\nI have finished it, I am to have the king's daughter for my wife.\nWell, said the little man, such an one shall it be, and remain.\nIn the evening, when the sun had turned into gold, Hans finished\nhis boat, and all that was wanted for it.  He got into it and\nrowed to the palace.  The boat went as swiftly as the wind.  The\nking saw it from afar, but would not give his daughter to Hans\nyet, and said he must first take a hundred hares out to pasture\nfrom early morning until late evening, and if one of them got\naway, he should not have his daughter.  Hans was contented\nwith this, and the next day went with his flock to the pasture,\nand took great care that none of them ran away.\nBefore many hours had passed came a servant from the palace, and\ntold Hans that he must give her a hare instantly, for some\nvisitors had come unexpectedly.  Hans, however, was very well\naware what that meant, and said he would not give her one.  The\nking might set some hare soup before his guest next day.  The\nmaid, however, would not accept his refusal, and at last she\nbegan to argue with him.  Then Hans said that if the king's\ndaughter came herself, he would give her a fare.  The maid told\nthis in the palace, and the daughter did go herself.  In the\nmeantime the little man came again to Hans, and asked him what he\nwas doing there.  He said he had to watch over a hundred hares\nand see that none of them ran away,\nand then he might marry the king's daughter and be king.  Good,\nsaid the little man, there is a whistle for you, and if one of\nthem runs away, just whistle with it, and then it will come\nback again.  When the king's daughter came, Hans gave her a\nhare into her apron, but when she had gone about a hundred steps\nwith it, he whistled, and the hare jumped out of the apron,\nand before she could turn round was back to the flock again.\nWhen the evening came the hare-herd whistled once more, and\nlooked to see if all were there, and then drove them to the\npalace.  The king wondered how Hans had been able to take a\nhundred hares to graze without losing any of them, but he still\nwould not give him his daughter yet, and said he must now\nbring him a feather from the griffin's tail.  Hans set out at\nonce, and walked straight forwards.  In the evening he came\nto a castle, and there he asked for a night's lodging, for at\nthat time there were no inns.  The lord of the castle promised\nhim that with much pleasure, and asked where he was going.  Hans\nanswered, to the griffin.  Oh, to the griffin.  They tell me\nhe knows everything, and I have lost the key of an iron money-chest.\nSo you might be so good as to ask him where it is.  Yes,\nindeed, said Hans, I will do that.  Early the next morning he\nwent onwards, and on his way arrived at another castle in which\nhe again stayed the night.  When the people who lived there\nlearnt that he was going to the griffin, they said they had\nin the house a daughter who was ill, and that they had already\ntried every means to cure her, but none of them had done her\nany good, and he might be so kind as to ask the griffin what\nwould make their daughter healthy again.  Hans said he would\nwillingly do that, and went onwards.  Then he came to a lake,\nand instead of a ferry-boat, a tall, tall man was there who\nhad to carry everybody across.  The man asked Hans whither he was\njourneying.  To the griffin, said Hans.  Then when you get to\nhim, said the man, just ask him why I am forced to carry\neverybody over the lake.  Yes, indeed, most certainly I'll do\nthat, said Hans.  Then the man took him up on his shoulders, and\ncarried him across.  At length Hans arrived at the griffin's\nhouse, but the wife only was at home, and not the griffin\nhimself.  Then the woman asked him what he wanted.  Thereupon he\ntold her everything - that he had to get a feather out of the\ngriffin's tail, and that there was a castle where they had lost\nthe key of their money-chest, and he was to ask the griffin where\nit was - that in another castle the daughter was ill, and\nhe was to learn what would cure her - and then not far from thence\nthere was a lake and a man beside it, who was forced to carry\npeople across it, and he was very anxious to learn why the man\nwas obliged to do it.  Then said the woman, look here, my good\nfriend, no christian can speak to the griffin.  He devours them\nall, but if you like you can lie down under his bed, and in the\nnight, when he is quite fast asleep, you can reach out and pull\na feather out of his tail, and as for those things which you\nare to learn, I will ask about them myself.  Hans was quite\nsatisfied with\nthis, and got under the bed.  In the evening, the griffin came\nhome, and as soon as he entered the room, said, wife, I smell\na christian.  Yes, said the woman, one was here to-day, but he\nwent away again.  And on that the griffin said no more.\nIn the middle of the night when the griffin was snoring loudly,\nHans reached out and plucked a feather from his tail.  The\ngriffin woke up instantly, and said, wife, I smell a christian,\nand it seems to me that somebody was pulling at my tail.  His\nwife said, you have certainly been dreaming, and I told you\nbefore that a christian was here to-day, but that he went away\nagain.  He told me all kinds of things - that in one castle they\nhad lost the key of their money-chest, and could find it nowhere.\nOh.  The fools, said the griffin.  The key lies in the wood-house\nunder a log of wood behind the door.  And then he said that in\nanother castle the daughter was ill, and they knew no remedy\nthat would cure her.  Oh.  The fools, said the griffin.  Under\nthe cellar-steps a toad has made its nest of her hair, and if\nshe got her hair back she would be well.  And then he also\nsaid that there was a place where there was a lake and a man\nbeside it who was forced to carry everybody across.  Oh, the\nfool, said the griffin.  If he only put one man down in the\nmiddle, he would never have to carry another across.  Early the\nnext morning the griffin got up and went out.  Then Hans\ncame forth from under the bed, and he had a beautiful feather,\nand had heard what the griffin had said about the key, and\nthe daughter, and the man.  The griffin's wife repeated it all\nonce more to him that he might not forget it, and then he went\nhome again.  First he came to the man by the lake, who asked\nhim what the griffin had said, but Hans replied that he must\nfirst carry him across, and then he would tell him.  So the man\ncarried him across, and when he was over Hans told him that all\nhe had to do was to set one person down in the middle of the\nlake, and then he would never have to carry over any more.  The\nman was hugely delighted, and told Hans that out of gratitude he\nwould take him once more across, and back again.  But Hans said\nno, he would save him the trouble, he was quite satisfied\nalready, and pursued his way.  Then he came to the\ncastle where the daughter was ill.  He took her on his shoulders,\nfor she could not walk, and carried her down the cellar-steps and\npulled out the toad's nest from beneath the lowest step and gave\nit into her hand, and she sprang off his shoulder and up the\nsteps before him, and was quite cured.  Then were the father and\nmother beyond measure rejoiced, and they gave Hans gifts of gold\nand of silver, and whatsoever else he wished for, that they\ngave him.  And when he got to the other castle he went at once\ninto the wood-house, and found the key under the log of wood\nbehind the door, and took it to the lord of the castle.  He\nwas not a little pleased, and gave Hans as a reward much of the\ngold that was in the chest, and all kinds of things besides,\nsuch as cows, and sheep, and goats.  When Hans arrived before\nthe king, with all these things - with the money, and the gold,\nand the silver and the cows, sheep and goats, the king asked\nhim how he had come by them.  Then Hans told him that the\ngriffin gave every one whatsoever he wanted.  So the king thought\nhe himself could make use of such things, and set out on his way\nto the griffin, but when he got to the lake, it happened that\nhe was the very first who arrived there after Hans, and the man\nput him down in the middle of it and went away, and the king\nwas drowned.  Hans, however, married the daughter, and became\nking.\n", "Strong Hans": "There were once a man and a woman who had an only child, and\nlived quite alone in a solitary valley.  It came to pass that the\nmother once went into the wood to gather branches of fir, and\ntook with her little Hans, who was just two years old.  As it\nwas spring-time, and the child took pleasure in the many-colored\nflowers, she went still further onwards with him into the forest.\nSuddenly two robbers sprang out of the thicket, seized the mother\nand child, and carried them far away into the black forest, where\nno one ever came from one year's end to another.  The poor woman\nurgently begged the robbers to set her and her child free, but\ntheir hearts were made of stone, they would not listen to her\nprayers and entreaties, and drove her on farther by force.  After\nthey had worked their way through bushes and briars for about\ntwo miles, they came to a rock where there was a door, at which\nthe robbers knocked and it opened at once.  They had to go through\na long dark passage, which burnt on the hearth.  On the wall hung\nswords, sabres, and other deadly weapons which gleamed in the\nlight, and in the midst stood a black table at which four other\nrobbers were sitting gambling, and the captain sat at the head of\nit.  As soon as he saw the woman he came and spoke to her, and\ntold her to be at ease and have no fear, they would do nothing to\nhurt her, but she must look after the housekeeping, and if she\nkept everything in order, she should not fare ill with them.\nThereupon they gave her something to eat, and showed her a bed\nwhere she might sleep with her child.\nThe woman stayed many years with the robbers, and Hans grew\ntall and strong.  His mother told him stories, and taught him\nto read an old book of tales about knights which she found in\nthe cave.  When Hans was nine years old, he made himself a strong\nclub out of a branch of fir, hid it behind the bed, and then\nwent to his mother and said, dear mother, pray tell me who is\nmy father.  I must and will know.  His mother was silent and\nwould not tell him, that he might not become home-sick.  Moreover\nshe knew that the godless robbers would not let him go away, but\nit almost broke her heart that Hans should not go to his father.\nIn the night, when the robbers came home from their robbing\nexpedition, Hans brought out his club, stood before the captain,\nand said, I now wish to know who my father is, and if you do not\ntell me at once I will strike you down.  Then the captain laughed,\nand gave Hans such a box on the ear that he rolled under the table.\nHans got up again, held his tongue, and thought, I will wait\nanother year and then try again, perhaps I shall do better then.\nWhen the year was over, he brought out his club again, rubbed the\ndust off it, looked at it well, and said,\nit is a stout strong club.  At night the robbers came home,\ndrank one jug of wine after another, and their heads began to be\nheavy.  Then Hans brought out his club, placed himself before\nthe captain, and asked him who his father was.  But the captain\nagain gave him such a vigorous box on the ear that Hans rolled\nunder the table.  However, it was not long before he was up again,\nand so beat the captain and the robbers with his club, that\nthey could no longer move either their arms or their legs.\nHis mother stood in a corner full of admiration for his bravery\nand strength.  When Hans had done his work, he went to his mother,\nand said, now I have shown myself to be in earnest, but now I\nmust also know who my father is.  Dear Hans, answered the\nmother, come, we will go and seek him until we find him.  She\ntook from the captain the key to the entrance-door, and Hans\nfetched a great meal-sack and packed into it gold and silver, and\nwhatsoever else he could find that was beautiful, until it was\nfull, and then he took it on his back.  They left the cave, but\nhow Hans did open his eyes when he came out of the darkness\ninto daylight, and saw the green forest, and the flowers, and\nthe birds, and the morning sun in the sky.  He stood there and\nwondered at everything just as if he were not quite right in the\nhead.  His mother looked for the way home, and when they had\nwalked for a couple of hours, they got safely into their lonely\nvalley and to their little house.  The father was sitting in the\ndoorway.  He wept for joy when he recognized his wife and heard\nthat Hans was his son, for he had long regarded them both as\ndead.  But Hans, although he was not twelve years old, was a\nhead taller than his father.  They went into the little room\ntogether, but Hans had scarcely put his sack on the bench by\nthe stove, than the whole house began to crack - the bench broke\ndown and then the floor, and the heavy sack fell through into\nthe cellar.  God save us, cried the father, what's that.  Now\nyou have broken our little house to pieces.  Don't let that turn\nyour hair grey, dear father, answered Hans.  There, in that sack,\nis more than is wanting for a new house.  The father and Hans\nat once began to build a new house, to buy cattle and land, and\nto keep a farm.  Hans ploughed the fields, and\nwhen he followed the plough and pushed it into the ground, the\nbullocks had scarcely any need to draw.\nThe next spring, Hans said, keep all the money and have made for\nme a walking-stick that weighs a hundred-weight, that I may\ngo a-traveling.  When the stick was ready, he left his father's\nhouse, went forth, and came to a deep, dark forest.  There he\nheard something crunching and cracking, looked round, and saw\na fir-tree which was wound round like a rope from the bottom to\nthe top, and when he looked upwards he saw a great fellow who\nhad laid hold of the tree and was twisting it like a willow-wand.\nHullo, cried Hans, what are you doing up there.  The fellow\nreplied, I got some faggots together yesterday and am twisting\na rope for them.  That is what I like, thought Hans, he has some\nstrength, and he called to him, leave that alone, and come with\nme.  The fellow came down, and he was taller by a whole head than\nHans, and Hans was not little.  Your name is now fir-twister,\nsaid Hans to him.  Thereupon they went further and heard something\nknocking and hammering with such force that the ground shook\nat every stroke.  Shortly afterwards they came to a mighty rock,\nbefore which a giant was standing and striking great pieces of\nit away with his fist.  When Hans asked what he was doing, he\nanswered, at night, when I want to sleep, bears, wolves, and\nother vermin of that kind come, which sniff and snuffle about\nme and won't let me rest, so I want to build myself a house and\nlay myself inside it, so that I may have some peace.  Oh indeed,\nthought Hans, I can make use of this one also, and said to him,\nleave your house-building alone, and go with me.  You shall be\ncalled rock-splitter.  The man consented, and they all three\nroamed through the forest, and wherever they went the wild beasts\nwere terrified, and ran away from them.  In the evening they\ncame to an old deserted castle, went up into it, and\nlaid themselves down in the hall to sleep.  The next morning Hans\nwent into the garden.  It had run quite wild, and was full of\nthorns and brambles.  And as he was thus walking round about,\na wild boar rushed at him, he, however, gave it such a blow\nwith his club that it fell directly.  He took it on his shoulders\nand carried it\nin, and they put it on a spit, roasted it, and enjoyed themselves.\nThen they arranged that each day, in turn, two should go out\nhunting, and one should stay at home, and cook nine pounds\nof meat for each of them.  Fir-twister stayed at home the first,\nand Hans and rock-splitter went out hunting.  When fir-twister\nwas busy cooking, a little shrivelled-up old mannikin came to him\nin the castle, and asked for some meat.  Be off, you sneaking\nimp, he answered, you need no meat.  But how astonished fir-twister\nwas when the little insignificant dwarf sprang up at him, and\nbelabored him so with his fists that he could not defend himself,\nbut fell on the ground and gasped for breath.  The dwarf did\nnot go away until he had thoroughly vented his anger on him.\nWhen the two others came home from hunting, fir-twister said\nnothing to them of the old mannikin and of the blows which he\nhimself had received, and thought, when they stay at home, they\nmay just try their  chance with the little scrubbing-brush, and\nthe mere thought of that gave him pleasure already.\nThe next day rock-splitter stayed at home, and he fared just\nas fir-twister had done, being very ill-treated by the dwarf\nbecause he was not willing to give him any meat.  When the others\ncame home in the evening, fir-twister saw clearly what he had\nsuffered, but both kept silence, and thought, Hans also\nmust taste some of that soup.\nHans, who had to stay at home the next day, did his work in\nthe kitchen as it had to be done, and as he was standing\nskimming the pan, the dwarf came and without more ado\ndemanded a piece of meat.  Then Hans thought, he is a poor\nwretch, I will give him some of my share, that the others may\nnot run short, and handed him a bit.  When the dwarf had\ndevoured it, he again asked for some meat, and good-natured\nHans gave it to him, and told him it was a handsome piece,\nand that he was to be content with it.  But the dwarf begged\nagain for the third time.  You are shameless, said Hans, and gave\nhim none.  Then the malicious dwarf wanted to spring on him and\ntreat him as he had treated fir-twister and rock-splitter, but\nhe had chosen the wrong man.  Hans, without\nexerting himself much, gave him a couple of blows which made\nhim jump down the castle steps.  Hans was about to run after him,\nbut fell right over, flat on his face.  When he rose up again,\nthe dwarf had got the start of him.  Hans hurried after him as far\nas the forest, and saw him slip into a hole in the rock.  Hans now\nwent home, but he had marked the spot.  When the two others\ncame back, they were surprised that Hans was so well.  He told\nthem what had happened, and then they no longer concealed how\nit had fared with them.  Hans laughed and said, it served you\nquite right.  Why were you so mean with your meat.  It is a\ndisgrace that you who are so big should have let yourselves be\nbeaten by the dwarf.  Thereupon they took a basket and a rope,\nand all three went to the hole in the rock into which the\ndwarf had slipped, and let Hans and his club\ndown in the basket.  When Hans had reached the bottom, he found\na door, and when he opened it a maiden was sitting there\nwho was lovely as any picture, nay, so beautiful that no words\ncan express it, and by her side sat the dwarf and grinned at\nHans like a sea-cat.  She, however, was bound with chains, and\nlooked so mournfully at him that Hans felt great pity for her,\nand thought to himself, you must deliver her out of the power of\nthe wicked dwarf, and gave him such a blow with his club that he\nfell down dead.  Immediately the chains fell from\nthe maiden, and Hans was enraptured with her beauty.  She told\nhim she was a king's daughter whom a savage count had stolen\naway from her home, and imprisoned there among the rocks,\nbecause she would have nothing to say to him.  The count, however,\nhad set the dwarf as a watchman, and he had made her suffer\nmisery and vexation enough.  And now Hans placed the maiden in the\nbasket and had her drawn up.  The basket came down again, but\nHans did not trust his two companions, and thought, they have\nalready shown themselves to be false, and told me nothing about\nthe dwarf.  Who knows what design they may have against me.  So\nhe put his club in the basket, and it was lucky he did, for when\nthe basket was half-way up, they let it fall again, and if Hans\nhad really been sitting in it he would have been killed.  But\nnow he did not know how he was to work his way out of the depths,\nand when he turned it over and over in his mind he found no\ncounsel.  It is indeed sad, said he to himself, that I have to\nwaste away down here, and as he was thus walking backwards and\nforwards, he once more came to the little chamber where the maiden\nhad been sitting, and saw that the dwarf had a ring on his finger\nwhich shone and sparkled.  Then he drew it off and put it on, and\nwhen he turned it round on his finger, he suddenly heard something\nrustle over his head.  He looked up and saw spirits of the air\nhovering above, who told him he was their master, and asked\nwhat his desire might be.  Hans was at first struck dumb, but\nafterwards he said that they were to carry him up again.  They\nobeyed instantly, and it was just as if he had flown up himself.\nBut when he had arrived there, he found no one in sight.\nFir-twister and rock-splitter\nhad hurried away, and had taken the beautiful maiden with them.\nBut Hans turned the ring, and the spirits of the air came and\ntold him that the two were on the sea.  Hans ran and ran without\nstopping, until he came to the sea-shore, and there far, far out\non the water, he perceived a little boat in which his faithless\ncomrades were sitting, and in fierce anger he leapt, without\nthinking what he was doing, club in hand into the water, and\nbegan to swim, but the club, which weighed a hundredweight,\ndragged him deep down until he was all but drowned.  Then\nin the very nick of time he turned his ring, and immediately\nthe spirits of the air came and bore him as swift as lightning into\nthe boat.  He swung his club and gave his wicked comrades the\nreward they merited and threw them into the water, and then he\nsailed with the beautiful maiden, who had been in the greatest\nalarm, and whom he delivered for the second time, home to her\nfather and mother, and married her, and all rejoiced exceedingly.\n", "The Hut in the Forest": "A poor wood-cutter lived with his wife and three daughters in\na little hut on the edge of a lonely forest.  One morning as he\nwas about to go to his work, he said to his wife, let our\neldest daughter bring me my dinner into the forest, or I shall\nnever get my work done, and in order that she may not miss\nher way, he added, I will take a bag of millet with me and strew\nthe seeds on the path.  When, therefore, the sun was just above\nthe centre of the forest, the girl set out on her way with a\nbowl of soup, but the field-sparrows, and wood-sparrows,\nlarks and finches, blackbirds and siskins had picked up the\nmillet long before, and the girl could not find the track.\nTrusting to chance, she went on and on, until the sun sank and\nnight began to fall.  The trees rustled in the darkness, the\nowls hooted, and she began to be afraid.  Then in the distance she\nperceived a light which glimmered between the trees.  There\nought to be some people living there, who can take me in for the\nnight,\nthought she, and went up to the light.  It was not long before\nshe came to a house the windows of which were all lighted up.  She\nknocked, and a rough voice from inside cried, come in.  The\ngirl stepped into the dark entrance, and knocked at the door of\nthe room.  Just come in, cried the voice, and when she opened the\ndoor, an old gray-haired man was sitting at the table, supporting\nhis face with both hands, and his white beard fell down over\nthe table almost as far as the ground.  By the stove lay three\nanimals, a hen, a cock, and a brindled cow.  The girl told her\nstory to the old man, and begged for shelter for the night.  The\nman said,\n               my pretty hen,\n               my pretty cock,\n               my pretty brindled cow,\n               what are you saying now.\nDuks, answered the animals, and that must have meant, we are\nwilling, for the old man said, here you shall have shelter\nand food, go to the fire, and cook us our supper.  The girl\nfound in the kitchen abundance of everything, and cooked a\ngood supper, but had no thought of the animals.  She carried\nthe full bowl to the table, seated herself by the gray-haired man,\nate and satisfied her hunger.  When she had had enough, she said,\nbut now I am tired, where is there a bed in which I can lie down,\nand sleep.  The animals replied,\n               thou hast eaten with him,\n               thou hast drunk with him,\n               thou hast had no thought for us,\n               so find out for thyself where thou canst pass the\n               night.\nThen said the old man, just go upstairs, and you will find a\nroom with two beds, shake them up, and put white linen on them,\nand then I, too, will come and lie down to sleep.  The girl\nwent up, and when she had shaken the beds and put clean sheets\non, she lay down in one of them without waiting any longer for\nthe old man.  After some time the gray-haired man came, held his\ncandle over the girl and shook his head.  When he saw that she\nhad fallen into a sound sleep, he opened a trap-door, and let her\ndown into the cellar.\nLate at night, the wood-cutter came home, and reproached his\nwife for leaving him to hunger all day.  It is not my fault,\nshe replied, the girl went out with your dinner, and must have\nlost herself, but surely she will come back to-morrow.  The\nwood-cutter, however, arose before dawn to go into the forest, and\nrequested that the second daughter should take him his dinner\nthat day.  I will take a bag with lentils, said he, the seeds\nare larger than millet, the girl will see them better, and\ncan't lose her way.  At dinner-time, therefore, the girl took\nout the food, but the lentils had disappeared.  The birds of the\nforest had picked them up as they had done the day before,\nand had left none.  The girl wandered about in the forest\nuntil night, and then she too reached the house of the old man,\nwas told to go in, and begged for food and a bed.  The man with\nthe white beard again asked the animals,\n               my pretty hen,\n               my pretty cock,\n               my pretty brindled cow,\n               what are you saying now.\nThe animals again replied 'duks, and everything happened just\nas it had happened the day before.  The girl cooked a good meal,\nate and drank with the old man, and did not concern herself about\nthe animals, and when she inquired about her bed they answered,\n               thou hast eaten with him,\n               thou hast drunk with him,\n               thou hast had no thought for us,\n               so find out for thyself where thou canst pass\n               the night.\nWhen she was asleep the old man came, looked at her, shook his\nhead, and let her down into the cellar.\nOn the third morning the wood-cutter said to his wife, send our\nyoungest child out with my dinner to-day, she has always been good\nand obedient, and will stay in the right path, and not rove about\nlike her sisters, the wild bumble-bees.  The mother did not\nwant to do it, and said, am I to lose my dearest child, as well.\nHave no fear, he replied, the girl will not go astray.  She is\ntoo prudent and sensible.  Besides I will take some peas with me,\nstrew them about.  They are still larger than lentils, and will\nshow her the way.  But when the girl went out with her basket on\nher arm, the wood-pigeons had already got all the peas in their\ncrops, and she did not know which way she was to turn.  She was\nfull of sorrow and never ceased to think how hungry her father\nwould be, and how her good mother would grieve, if she did\nnot go home.  At length when it grew dark, she saw the light and\ncame to the house in the forest.  She begged quite prettily to\nbe allowed to spend the night there, and the man with the white\nbeard again asked his animals,\n               my pretty hen,\n               my pretty cock,\n               my pretty brindled cow,\n               what are you saying now.\nDuks, said they.  Then the girl went to the stove where the\nanimals were lying, and petted the cock and hen, and stroked\ntheir smooth feathers with her hand, and caressed the brindled\ncow between her horns, and when, in obedience to the old man's\norders, she had made ready some good soup, and the bowl was\nplaced upon the table, she said, am I to eat as much as I want,\nand the good animals to have nothing.  Outside is food in plenty,\nI will look after them first.  So she went and brought some\nbarley and stewed it for the cock and hen, and a whole armful\nof sweet-smelling hay for the cow.  I hope you will like it,\ndear animals, said she, and you shall have a refreshing draught\nin case you are thirsty.  Then she fetched a bucketful of water,\nand the cock and hen jumped on to the edge of it and dipped\ntheir beaks in, and then held up their heads as the birds do when\nthey drink, and the brindled cow also took a hearty draught.  When\nthe animals were fed, the girl seated herself at the table by\nthe old man, and ate what he had left.  It was not long before\nthe cock and the hen began to thrust their heads beneath\ntheir wings, and the eyes of the cow likewise began to blink.\nThen said the girl, ought we not to go to bed.\n               My pretty hen,\n               my pretty cock,\n               my pretty brindled cow,\n               what are you saying now.\nThe animals answered, duks,\n               thou hast eaten with us,\n               thou hast drunk with us,\n               thou hast had kind thought for all of us,\n               we wish thee good-night.\nThen the maiden went upstairs, shook the feather-beds, and laid\nclean sheets on them, and when she had done it the old man came\nand lay down in one of the beds, and his white beard reached down\nto his feet.  The girl lay down on the other, said her prayers,\nand fell asleep.\n\nShe slept quietly till midnight, and then there was such a noise\nin the house that she awoke.  There was a sound of cracking and\nsplitting in every corner, and the doors sprang open, and beat\nagainst the walls.  The beams groaned as if they were being torn\nout of their joints, it seemed as if the staircase were falling\ndown, and at length there was a crash as if the entire roof had\nfallen in.  When, however, all grew quiet once more, and the girl\nwas not hurt, she stayed quietly lying where she was, and fell\nasleep again.  But when she woke up in the morning with the\nbrilliancy of the sunshine, what did her eyes behold.  She was\nlying in a vast hall, and everything around her shone with royal\nsplendor.  On the walls, golden flowers grew up on a ground of\ngreen silk, the bed was of ivory, and the canopy of red velvet,\nand on a chair close by, was a pair of slippers embroidered\nwith pearls.  The girl believed that she was in a dream, but\nthree richly clad attendants came in, and asked what orders she\nwould like to give.  If you will go, she replied, I will get up\nat once and make ready some soup for the old man, and then I\nwill feed the pretty hen, and the pretty cock, and the pretty\nbrindled cow.  She thought the old man was up already, and looked\nround at his bed.  He, however, was not lying in it, but a\nstranger.\n\nAnd while she was looking at him, and becoming aware that he was\nyoung and handsome, he awoke, sat up in bed, and said, I am\na king's son, and was bewitched by a wicked witch, and made to\nlive in this forest, as an old gray-haired man.  No one was\nallowed to be with me but my three attendants in the form\nof a cock, a hen, and a brindled cow.  The spell was not to be\nbroken until a girl came to us whose heart was so good that she\nshowed herself full of love, not only towards mankind, but towards\nanimals - and that you have done, and by you at midnight we were\nset free, and the old hut in the forest was changed back again\ninto my royal palace.  And when they had arisen, the king's son\nordered the three attendants to set out and fetch the father and\nmother of the girl to the marriage feast.  But where are my two\nsisters, inquired the maiden.  I have locked them in the cellar,\nand to-morrow they shall be led into the forest, and shall live\nas servants to a charcoal-burner, until they have grown kinder,\nand do not leave poor animals to suffer hunger.\n", "The Goose-Girl at the Well": "There was once upon a time a very old woman, who lived with her\nflock of geese in a remote clearing in the mountains, and there\nhad a little house.  The clearing was surrounded by a large forest,\nand every morning the old woman took her crutch and hobbled\ninto it.  There, however, she was quite active, more so than\nany one would have thought, considering her age, and collected\ngrass for her geese, picked all the wild fruit she could\nreach, and carried everything home on her back.  Anyone would have\nthought that the heavy load would have weighed her to the ground,\nbut she always brought it safely home.  If anyone met her, she\ngreeted him quite courteously.  Good day, dear countryman, it\nis a fine day.  Ah, you wonder that I should drag grass about, but\neveryone must take his burden on his back.  Nevertheless, people\ndid not like to meet her if they could help it, and took by\npreference a round-about way, and when a father with his boys\npassed her, he whispered to them, beware of the old woman.  She\nhas claws beneath her gloves.  She is a witch.\nOne morning, a handsome young man was going through the forest.\nThe sun shone bright, the birds sang, a cool breeze crept\nthrough the leaves, and he was full of joy and gladness.  He\nhad as yet met no one, when he suddenly perceived the old witch\nkneeling on the ground cutting grass with a sickle.  She had\nalready thrust a whole load into her bundle, and near it stood\ntwo baskets, which were filled with wild apples and pears.  But,\ngood little mother, said he, how can you carry all that away.  I\nmust carry it, dear sir, answered she, rich folk's children\nhave no need to do such things, but with the peasant folk the\nsaying goes, don't look behind you, you will only see how crooked\nyour back is.\nWill you help me, she said, as he remained standing by her.\nYou have still a straight back and young legs, it would be a\ntrifle to you.  Besides, my house is not so very far from here,\nit stands there on the heath behind the hill.  How soon you\nwould bound up thither.  The young man took compassion on the\nold woman.  My father is certainly no peasant, replied he, but\na rich count.  Nevertheless, that you may see that it is not only\npeasants who can carry things, I will take your bundle.  If\nyou will try it, said she, I shall be very glad.  You will\ncertainly have to walk for an hour, but what will that matter to\nyou, only you must carry the apples and pears as well.  The young\nman felt somewhat uneasy when he heard of an hour's walk, but the\nold woman would not let him off, packed the bundle on his back,\nand hung the two baskets on his arm.  See, it is quite light, said\nshe.  No, it is not light, answered the count, and pulled a rueful\nface.  Verily, the bundle weighs as heavily as if it were full of\ncobblestones, and the apples and pears are as heavy as lead.  I\ncan scarcely breathe.  He had a mind to put everything down\nagain, but the old woman would not allow it.  Just look, said\nshe mockingly, the young gentleman will not carry what I, an old\nwoman, have so often dragged along.  You are ready with fine words,\nbut when it comes to be earnest, you want to take to your heels.\nWhy are you standing loitering there.  She continued, step out.\nNo one will take the bundle off again.  As long as he walked on\nlevel ground, it was still bearable, but when they came to the hill\nand had to climb, and the stones rolled down under his feet as if\nthey were alive, it was beyond his strength.  Drops of sweat stood\non his forehead, and ran, hot and cold, down his back.  Mother,\nsaid he, I can go no farther.  I want to rest a little.  Not\nhere, answered the old woman, when we have arrived at our journey's\nend, you can rest.  But now you must go forward.  Who knows\nwhat good it may do you.  Old woman, you are becoming shameless,\nsaid the count, and tried to throw off the bundle, but he labored\nin vain.  It stuck as fast to his back as if it grew there.\nHe turned and twisted, but he could not get rid of it.  The old\nwoman laughed at this, and sprang about quite delighted on\nher crutch.  Don't get angry, dear sir, said she, you are growing\nas\nred in the face as a turkey-cock.  Carry your bundle patiently.\nI will give you a good present when we get home.\nWhat could he do.  He was obliged to submit to his fate, and\ncrawl along patiently behind the old woman.  She seemed to grow\nmore and more nimble, and his burden still heavier.  All\nat once she made a bound, jumped on to the bundle and seated\nherself on the top of it.  And however withered she might be,\nshe was yet heavier than the stoutest country lass.  The\nyouth's knees trembled, but when he did not go on, the old woman\nhit him about the legs with a switch and with stinging-nettles.\nGroaning continually, he climbed the mountain, and at length\nreached the old woman's house, when he was just about to drop.\nWhen the geese perceived the old woman, they flapped their wings,\nstretched out their necks, ran to meet her, cackling all the\nwhile.  Behind the flock walked, stick in hand, an old wench,\nstrong and big, but ugly as night.  Good mother, said she to\nthe old woman, has anything happened to you, you have stayed\naway so long.  By no means, my dear daughter, answered she,\nI have met with nothing bad, but, on the contrary, with this\nkind gentleman, who has carried my burden for me.  Only think,\nhe even took me on his back when I was\ntired.  The way, too, has not seemed long to us.  We have been\nmerry, and have been cracking jokes with each other all the\ntime.  At last the old woman slid down, took the bundle off the\nyoung man's back, and the baskets from his arm, looked at him\nquite kindly, and said, now seat yourself on the bench before\nthe door, and rest.  You have fairly earned your wages, and they\nshall not be wanting.  Then she said to the goose-girl, go\ninto the house, my dear daughter, it is not becoming for you\nto be alone with a young gentleman.  One must not pour oil on to\nthe fire, he might fall in love with you.  The count knew not\nwhether to laugh or to cry.  Such a sweetheart as that, thought\nhe, could not touch my heart, even if she were thirty years\nyounger.  In the meantime the old woman stroked\nand fondled her geese as if they were children, and then went\ninto the house with her daughter.  The youth lay down on the\nbench, under a wild apple-tree.  The air was warm and mild.  On\nall sides stretched a green meadow, which was set with cowslips,\nwild thyme, and a thousand other flowers.  Through the midst\nof it rippled a clear brook on which the sun sparkled, and\nthe white geese went walking backwards and forwards, or paddled in\nthe water.  It is quite delightful here, said he, but I am so\ntired that I cannot keep my eyes open.  I will sleep a little.\nIf only a gust of wind does not come and blow my legs off my\nbody, for they are as rotten as tinder.\nWhen he had slept a little while, the old woman came and shook\nhim till he awoke.  Sit up, said she, you can not stay here.  I\nhave certainly treated you ill enough, still it has not cost you\nyour life.  Of money and land you have no need, here is something\nelse for you.  Thereupon she thrust a little box into his hand,\nwhich was cut out of a single emerald.  Take great care of it,\nsaid she, it will bring you good fortune.  The count sprang up,\nand as he felt that he was quite fresh, and had recovered his\nvigor, he thanked the old woman for her present, and set off\nwithout even once looking back at the beautiful daughter.  When\nhe was already some way off, he still heard in the distance the\nnoisy cry of the geese.\nFor three days the count had to wander in the wilderness before\nhe could find his way out.  He then reached a large town, and as\nno\none knew him, he was led into the royal palace, where the king\nand queen were sitting on their throne.  The count fell on one\nknee, drew the emerald box out of his pocket, and laid it at the\nqueen's feet.  She bade him rise and hand her the little box.\nHardly, however, had she opened it, and looked therein, than she\nfell as if dead to the ground.  The count was seized by the king's\nservants, and was being led to prison, when the queen opened\nher eyes, and ordered them to release him, and every one was to\ngo out, as she wished to speak with him in private.\nWhen the queen was alone, she began to weep bitterly, and said,\nof what use to me are the splendors and honors with which I am\nsurrounded.  Every morning I awake in pain and sorrow.  I had\nthree daughters, the youngest of whom was so beautiful that the\nwhole world looked on her as a wonder.  She was as white as snow,\nas rosy as apple-blossom, and her hair as radiant as sun-beams.\nWhen she cried, not tears fell from her eyes, but pearls and\njewels only.  When she was fifteen years old, the king summoned\nall three sisters to come before his throne.  You should have seen\nhow all the people gazed when the youngest entered, it was just\nas if the sun were rising.  Then the king spoke, my daughters,\nI know not when my last day may arrive.  I will to-day decide what\neach shall receive at my death.  You all love me, but the one\nof you who loves me best, shall fare the best.  Each of them\nsaid she loved him best.  Can you not express to me, said the king,\nhow much you do love me, and thus I shall see what you mean.  The\neldest spoke, I love my father as dearly as the sweetest sugar.\nThe second, I love my father as dearly as my prettiest dress.  But\nthe youngest was silent.  Then the father said, and you,\nmy dearest child, how much do you love me.  I do not know, and\ncan compare my love with nothing.  But her father insisted that\nshe should name something.  So she said at last, the best food\ndoes not please me without salt, therefore I love my father\nlike salt.  When the king heard that, he fell into a passion, and\nsaid, if you love me like salt, your love shall also be repaid you\nwith salt.  Then he divided the kingdom between the two elder,\nbut caused a sack of salt to be bound on the back of the\nyoungest, and two servants had to lead her forth into the\nwild forest.  We all begged and prayed for her, said the queen,\nbut the king's anger was not to be appeased.  How she cried\nwhen she had to leave us.  The whole road was strewn with the\npearls which flowed from her eyes.  The king soon afterwards\nrepented of his great severity, and had the whole forest\nsearched for the poor child, but no one could find her.  When\nI think that the wild beasts have devoured her, I know not how\nto contain myself for sorrow.  Many a time I console myself\nwith the hope that she is still alive, and may have hidden herself\nin a cave, or has found shelter with compassionate people.  But\npicture to yourself, when I opened your little emerald box, a\npearl lay therein, of exactly the same kind as those which used\nto fall from my daughter's eyes.  And then you can also imagine\nhow the sight of it stirred my heart.  You must tell me how you\ncame by that pearl.  The count told her that he had received it\nfrom the old woman in the forest, who had appeared very strange\nto him, and must be a witch, but he had neither seen nor heard\nanything of the queen's child.  The king and the queen resolved\nto seek out the old woman.  They thought that there where the\npearl had been, they would obtain news of their daughter.\n\nThe old woman was sitting in that lonely place at her spinning-wheel\nspinning.  It was already dusk, and a log which was burning\non the hearth gave a scanty light.  All at once there was a noise\noutside, the geese were coming home from the pasture, and uttering\ntheir hoarse cries.  Soon afterwards the daughter also entered.\nBut the old woman scarcely thanked her, and only shook her\nhead a little.  The daughter sat down beside her, took her\nspinning-wheel, and twisted the threads as nimbly as a young girl.\nThus they both sat for two hours, and exchanged never a word.  At\nlast something rustled at the window and two fiery eyes peered\nin.  It was an old night-owl, which cried 'uhu, three times.  The\nold woman looked up just a little, then she said, now, my little\ndaughter, it is time for you to go out and do your work.  She rose\nand went out, and where did she go.  Over the meadows ever onward\ninto the valley.  At last she came to a well, with three old\noak-trees standing beside it.  Meanwhile\nthe moon had risen large and round over the mountain, and\nit was so light that one could have found a needle.  She removed\na skin which covered her face, then bent down to the well, and\nbegan to wash herself.  When she had finished, she dipped the\nskin also in the water, and then laid it on the meadow, so that\nit should bleach in the moonlight, and dry again.  But how the\nmaiden was changed.  Such a change as that was never seen before.\nWhen the gray mask fell off, her golden hair broke forth like\nsun-beams, and spread about like a mantle over her whole form.\nHer eyes shone out as brightly as the stars in heaven, and her\ncheeks bloomed a soft red like apple-blossom.\nBut the fair maiden was sad.  She sat down and wept bitterly.\nOne tear after another forced itself out of her eyes, and rolled\nthrough her long hair to the ground.  There she sat, and would\nhave remained sitting a long time, if there had not been a rustling\nand cracking in the boughs of the neighboring tree.  She sprang\nup like a roe which has been overtaken by the shot of the hunter.\nJust then the moon was obscured by a dark cloud, and in an instant\nthe maiden had put on the old skin and vanished, like a light\nblown out by the wind.\nShe ran back home, trembling like an aspen-leaf.  The old woman\nwas standing on the threshold, and the girl was about to relate\nwhat had befallen her, but the old woman laughed kindly, and\nsaid, I already know all.  She led her into the room and lighted\na new log.  She did not, however, sit down to her spinning again,\nbut fetched a broom and began to sweep and scour.  All must be\nclean and sweet, she said to the girl.  But, mother, said the\nmaiden, why do you begin work at so late an hour.  What do you\nexpect.  Do you know then what time it is, asked the old woman.\nNot yet midnight, answered the maiden, but already past eleven\no'clock.  Do you not remember, continued the old woman, that\nit is three years to-day since you came to me.  Your time is up,\nwe can no longer remain together.  The girl was terrified, and\nsaid, alas, dear mother, will you cast me off.  Where shall I go.\nI have no friends, and no home to which I can go.  I have always\ndone as you\nbade me, and you have always been satisfied with me.  Do not send\nme away.  The old woman would not tell the maiden what lay before\nher.  My stay here is over, she said to her, but when I depart,\nhouse and parlor must be clean.  Therefore do not hinder me in\nmy work.  Have no care for yourself, you shall find a roof to\nshelter you, and the wages which I will give you shall also\ncontent you.  But tell me what is about to happen, the maiden\ncontinued to entreat.  I tell you again, do not hinder me in my\nwork.  Do not say a word more, go to your chamber, take the skin\noff your face, and put on the silken gown which you had on when\nyou came to me, and then wait in your chamber until I call you.\nBut I must once more tell of the king and queen, who had\njourneyed forth with the count in order to seek out the old woman\nin the wilderness.  The count had strayed away from them in the\nwood by night, and had to walk onwards alone.  Next day it seemed\nto him that he was on the right track.  He still went forward,\nuntil darkness came on, then he climbed a tree, intending to\npass the night there, for he feared that he might lose his way.\nWhen the moon illumined the surrounding country he perceived a\nfigure coming down the mountain.  She had no stick in her hand,\nbut yet he could see that it was the goose-girl, whom he had\nseen before in the house of the old woman.  Oho, cried he, there\nshe comes, and if I once get hold of one of the witches, the\nother shall not escape me.  But how astonished he was, when\nshe went to the well, took off the skin and washed herself,\nwhen her golden hair fell down all about her, and she was\nmore beautiful than anyone whom he had ever seen in the whole\nworld.  He hardly dared to breathe, but stretched his head as\nfar forward through the leaves as he could, and stared at her.\nEither he bent over too far, or whatever the cause might be, the\nbough suddenly cracked, and that very moment the maiden slipped\ninto the skin, sprang away like a roe, and as the moon was\nsuddenly covered, disappeared from his sight.  Hardly had she\ndisappeared, before the count descended from the tree, and\nhastened after her with nimble steps.  He had not been gone\nlong before he saw, in the twilight, two figures coming over\nthe meadow.\nIt was the king and queen, who had perceived from a distance the\nlight shining in the old woman's little house, and were going\nto it.  The count told them what wonderful things he had seen\nby the well, and they did not doubt that it had been their lost\ndaughter.  They walked onwards full of joy, and soon came to the\nlittle house.  The geese were sitting all round it, and had\nthrust their heads under their wings and were sleeping, and not\none of them moved.  The king and queen looked in at the window,\nwhere the old woman was sitting quite quietly spinning, nodding\nher head and never looking round.  The room was perfectly clean,\nas if the little mist men, who carry no dust on their feet, lived\nthere.  Their daughter, however, they did not see.  They gazed at\nall this for a long time, until at last they took heart, and\nknocked softly at the window.  The old woman appeared to have\nbeen expecting them.  She rose, and called out quite kindly,\ncome in.  I know you already.  When they had entered the room,\nthe old woman said, you might have spared yourself the long\nwalk, if you had not three years ago unjustly driven away\nyour child, who is so good and lovable.  No harm has come to her.\nFor three years she has had to tend the geese.  With them she has\nlearnt no evil, but has preserved her purity of heart.  You,\nhowever, have been sufficiently punished by the misery in which\nyou have lived.  Then she went to the chamber and called, come\nout, my little daughter.  Thereupon the door opened, and the\nprincess stepped out in her silken garments, with her golden\nhair and her shining eyes, and it was as if an angel from heaven\nhad entered.\nShe went up to her father and mother, fell on their necks and\nkissed them.  There was no help for it, they all had to weep for\njoy.  The young count stood near them, and when she perceived him\nshe became as red in the face as a moss-rose, she herself did\nnot know why.  The king said, my dear child, I have given away\nmy kingdom, what shall I give you.  She needs nothing, said\nthe old woman.  I give her the tears that she has wept on your\naccount.  They are precious pearls, finer than those that are\nfound in the sea, and worth more than your whole kingdom, and I\ngive her my little\nhouse as payment for her services.  When the old woman had said\nthat, she disappeared from their sight.  The walls rattled a\nlittle, and when the king and queen looked round, the little\nhouse had changed into a splendid palace, a royal table had been\nspread, and the servants were running hither and thither.\nThe story goes still further, but my grandmother, who related\nit to me, had partly lost her memory, and had forgotten the rest.\nI shall always believe that the beautiful princess married the\ncount, and that they remained together in the palace, and\nlived there in all happiness so long as God willed it.  Whether\nthe snow-white geese, which were kept near the little hut, were\nverily young maidens no one need take offence, whom the old\nwoman had taken under her protection, and whether they now\nreceived their human form again, and stayed as handmaids to the\nyoung queen, I do not exactly know, but I suspect it.  This\nmuch is certain, that the old woman was no witch, as people\nthought, but a wise woman, who meant well.  Very likely it was\nshe who, at the princess's birth, gave her the gift of weeping\npearls instead of tears.  That does not happen nowadays, or else\nthe poor would soon become rich.\n", "Eve's Various Children": "When adam and eve were driven out of paradise, they were\ncompelled to build a house for themselves on barren ground, and\neat their bread in the sweat of their brow.  Adam dug up the land,\nand eve spun.  Every year eve brought a child into the world, but\nthe children were unlike each other, some pretty, and some ugly.\nAfter a considerable time had gone by, God sent an angel to them,\nto announce that he was coming to inspect their household.  Eve,\ndelighted that the lord should be so gracious, cleaned her\nhouse diligently, decked it with flowers, and\nstrewed rushes on the floor.  Then she brought in her children,\nbut only the beautiful ones.  She washed and bathed them, combed\ntheir hair, put clean raiment on them, and cautioned them to\nconduct themselves decorously and modestly in the presence of the\nLord.  They were to bow down before him civilly, hold out their\nhands, and to answer his questions modestly and sensibly.  The\nugly children, however, were not to let themselves be seen.  One\nhid himself beneath the hay, another under the roof, a third\nin the straw, the fourth in the stove, the fifth in the cellar,\nthe sixth under a tub, the seventh beneath the wine-cask, the\neighth under an old fur cloak, the ninth and tenth beneath the\ncloth out of which she always made their clothes, and the\neleventh and twelfth under the leather out of which she cut\ntheir shoes.  She had scarcely got ready, before there was a\nknock at the house-door.  Adam looked through a chink, and saw\nthat it was the Lord.  Adam opened the door respectfully,\nand the heavenly father entered.  There, in a row, stood the\npretty children, and bowed before him, held out their hands,\nand knelt down.  The Lord, however, began to bless them, laid\nhis hands on the first, and said, thou shalt be a powerful king,\nand to the second, thou a prince, to the third, thou a\ncount, to the fourth, thou a knight, to the fifth, thou\na nobleman, to the sixth, thou a burgher, to the seventh, thou\na merchant, to the eighth, thou a learned man.  He bestowed\nupon them also all his richest blessings.  When eve saw that\nthe Lord was so mild and gracious, she thought, I will bring\nhither my ill-favored children also, it may be that he will\nbestow his blessing on them likewise.\nSo she ran and brought them out of the hay, the straw, the\nstove, and wherever else she had concealed them.  Then came the\nwhole coarse, dirty, scabby, sooty band.  The Lord smiled,\nlooked at them all, and said, I will bless these also.  He laid\nhis hands on the first, and said to him, thou shalt be a peasant,\nto the second, thou a fisherman, to the third,\nthou a smith, to the fourth, thou a tanner, to the fifth, thou\na weaver, to the sixth, thou a shoemaker, to the seventh, thou\na tailor, to the eighth, thou a potter, to the ninth, thou a\nwaggoner, to the tenth, thou a sailor, to the eleventh, thou\na messenger, to the twelfth, thou a scullion all the days of\nthy life.\nWhen eve had heard all this she said, Lord, how unequally thou\ndividest thy gifts.  After all they are all of them my children,\nwhom I have brought into the world, thy favors should be given\nto all alike.  But God answered, eve, thou dost not understand.\nIt is right and necessary that the entire world should be\nsupplied from thy children.  If they were all princes and lords,\nwho would grow corn, thresh it, grind and bake it.  Who would\nbe blacksmiths, weavers, carpenters, masons, laborers, tailors\nand seamstresses.  Each shall have his own place, so that one\nshall support the other, and all shall be fed like the limbs of\none body.  Then eve answered, ah, Lord, forgive me, I was too\nquick in speaking to thee.  Have thy divine will with my children.\n", "The Nix of the Mill-Pond": "There was once upon a time a miller who lived with his wife\nin great contentment.  They had money and land, and their\nprosperity increased year by year more and more.  But ill\nluck comes like a thief in the night.  As their wealth had\nincreased so did it again decrease, year by year, and at last\nthe miller could\nhardly call the mill in which he lived, his own.  He was in great\ndistress, and when he lay down after his day's work, found no\nrest, but tossed about in his bed, sorely troubled.  One\nmorning he rose before daybreak and went out into the open air,\nthinking that perhaps there his heart might become lighter.  As\nhe was stepping over the mill-dam the first sunbeam was just\nbreaking forth, and he heard a rippling sound in the pond.  He\nturned round and perceived a beautiful woman, rising slowly out\nof the water.  Her long hair, which she was holding off her\nshoulders with her soft hands, fell down on both sides,\nand covered her white body.  He soon saw that she was the\nnixie of the mill-pond, and in his fright did not know whether\nhe should run away or stay where he was.  But the nixie made her\nsweet voice heard, called him by his name, and asked him why he\nwas so sad.  The miller was at first struck dumb, but when he heard\nher speak so kindly, he took heart, and told her how he had\nformerly lived in wealth and happiness, but that now he was so\npoor that he did not know what to do.  Be easy, answered the nixie,\nI will make you richer and happier than you have ever been\nbefore, only you must promise to give me the young thing which\nhas just been born in your house.  What else can that be, thought\nthe miller, but a puppy or a kitten, and he promised her what she\ndesired.  The nixie descended into the water again, and he\nhurried back to his mill, consoled and in good spirits.  He had\nnot yet reached it, when the maid-servant came out of the house\nand cried to him to rejoice, for his wife had given birth to\na little boy.  The miller stood as if struck by lightning.  He\nsaw very well that the cunning nixie had been aware of it, and had\ncheated him.  Hanging his head, he went up to his wife's bedside\nand when she said, why do you not rejoice over the fine boy, he\ntold her what had befallen him, and what kind of a promise he had\ngiven to the nixie.  Of what use to me are riches and prosperity,\nhe added, if I am to lose my child.  But what can I do.  Even the\nrelatives, who had come thither to wish them joy, did not know\nwhat to say.  In the meantime prosperity again returned to the\nmiller's house.  All that he undertook succeeded.  It was as\nif presses and coffers filled themselves\nof their own accord, and as if money multiplied nightly in the\ncupboards.  It was not long before his wealth was greater than\nit had ever been before.  But he could not rejoice over it\nuntroubled, for the bargain which he had made with the nixie\ntormented his soul.  Whenever he passed the mill-pond, he feared\nshe might ascend and remind him of his debt.  He never let the\nboy himself go near the water.  Beware, he said to him, if you\ndo but touch the water, a hand will rise, seize you, and draw you\ndown.  But as year after year went by and the nixie did not show\nherself again, the miller began to feel at ease.  The boy grew\nup to be a youth and was apprenticed to a huntsman.  When he had\nlearnt everything, and had become an excellent huntsman, the\nlord of the village took him into his service.  In the village\nlived a beautiful and true-hearted maiden, who pleased the\nhuntsman, and when his master perceived that, he gave him a\nlittle house, the two were married, lived peacefully and\nhappily, and loved each other with all their hearts.\nOne day the huntsman was chasing a roe.  And when the animal\nturned aside from the forest into the open country, he pursued\nit and at last shot it.  He did not notice that he was now in\nthe neighborhood of the dangerous mill-pond, and went, after\nhe had disembowelled the roe, to the water, in order to wash\nhis blood-stained hands.  Scarcely, however, had he dipped\nthem in than the nixie ascended, smilingly wound her dripping\narms around him, and drew him quickly down under the waves,\nwhich closed over him.  When it was evening, and the huntsman\ndid not return home, his wife became alarmed.  She went out to\nseek him, and as he had often told her that he had to be on\nhis guard against the snares of the nixie, and dared not venture\ninto the neighborhood of the mill-pond, she already suspected\nwhat had happened.  She hastened to the water, and\nwhen she found his hunting-pouch lying on the shore, she could\nno longer have any doubt of the misfortune.  Lamenting her\nsorrow, and wringing her hands, she called on her beloved\nby name, but in vain.  She hurried across to the other side\nof the pond, and called him anew.  She reviled the nixie with\nharsh words, but no answer greeted her.  The surface of the water\nremained calm, only the crescent moon stared steadily back at\nher.  The poor woman did not leave the pond.  With hasty steps,\nshe paced round and round it, without resting a moment, sometimes\nin silence, sometimes uttering a loud cry, sometimes sobbing\nsoftly.  At last her strength came to an end, she sank down\nto the ground and fell into a heavy sleep.  Presently a dream\ntook possession of her.\nShe was anxiously climbing upwards between great masses of\nrock.  Thorns and briars caught her feet, the rain beat in her\nface, and the wind tossed her long hair about.  When she had\nreached the summit, quite a different sight presented itself\nto her.  The sky was blue, the air soft, the ground sloped\ngently downwards, and on a green meadow, gay with flowers of\nevery color, stood a pretty cottage.  She went up to it and\nopened the door.  There sat an old woman\nwith white hair, who beckoned to her kindly.  At that very\nmoment, the poor woman awoke, day had already dawned, and she\nat once resolved to act in accordance with her dream.  She\nlaboriously climbed the mountain.  Everything was exactly as she\nhad seen it in the night.  The old woman received her kindly,\nand pointed out a chair on which she might sit.  You must have\nmet with a misfortune, she said, since you have sought out my\nlonely cottage.  With tears, the woman related what had befallen\nher.  Be comforted, said the old woman, I will help you.  Here\nis a golden comb for you.  Tarry till the full moon has risen,\nthen go to the mill-pond, seat yourself on the shore, and\ncomb your long black hair with this comb.  When you have done,\nlay it down on the bank, and you will see what will happen.  The\nwoman returned home, but the time till the full moon came, passed\nslowly.  When at last the shining disc appeared in the heavens,\nshe went out to the mill-pond, sat down and combed her long black\nhair with the golden comb, and when she had finished, she laid\nit down at the water's edge.  It was not long before there\nwas a movement in the depths, a wave rose, rolled to the shore,\nand bore the comb away with it.  In not more than the time\nnecessary for the comb to sink to the bottom, the surface of\nthe water parted, and the head of the huntsman arose.  He did\nnot speak, but looked at his wife with sorrowful glances.\nAt the same instant, a second wave came rushing up, and covered\nthe man's head.  All had vanished, the mill-pond lay peaceful as\nbefore, and nothing but the face of the full moon shone on it.\nFull of sorrow, the woman went back, but again the dream showed\nher the cottage of the old woman.  Next morning she again set\nout and complained of her woes to the wise woman.  The old\nwoman gave her a golden flute, and said, tarry till the full\nmoon comes again, then take this flute.  Play a beautiful air\non it, and when you have finished, lay it on the sand.  Then\nyou will see what will happen.  The wife did as the old woman\ntold her.  No sooner was the flute lying on the sand than there\nwas a stirring in the depths, and a wave rushed up and bore\nthe flute away with it.  Immediately afterwards the water\nparted, and not only the head of the man, but\nhalf of his body also arose.  He stretched out his arms\nlongingly towards her, but a second wave came up, covered him,\nand drew him down again.  Alas, what does it help me, said the\nunhappy woman, that I should see my beloved, only to lose him\nagain.  Despair filled her heart anew, but the dream led her\na third time to the house of the old woman.  She set out, and\nthe wise woman gave her a golden spinning-wheel, consoled her and\nsaid, all is not yet fulfilled, tarry until the time of the full\nmoon, then take the spinning-wheel, seat yourself on the shore,\nand spin the spool full, and when you have done that, place the\nspinning-wheel near the water, and you will see what will happen.\nThe woman obeyed all she said exactly.  As soon as the full moon\nshowed itself, she carried the golden spinning-wheel to the\nshore, and span industriously until the flax came to an end, and\nthe spool was quite filled with the threads.  No sooner was the\nwheel standing on the shore than there was a more violent movement\nthan before in the depths of the pond, and a mighty wave rushed\nup, and bore the wheel away with it.  Immediately the head and\nthe whole body of the man rose into the air, in a water-spout.\nHe quickly sprang to the shore, caught his wife by the hand and\nfled.  But they had scarcely gone a very little distance,\nwhen the whole pond rose with a frightful roar, and streamed\nout over the open country.  The fugitives already saw death\nbefore their eyes, when the woman in her terror implored the\nhelp of the old woman, and in an instant they were transformed,\nshe into a toad, he into a frog.  The flood which had overtaken\nthem could not destroy them, but it tore them apart and carried\nthem far away.\nWhen the water had dispersed and they both touched dry land again,\nthey regained their human form, but neither knew where the other\nwas.  They found themselves among strange people, who did not\nknow their native land.  High mountains and deep valleys lay\nbetween them.  In order to keep themselves alive, they were\nboth obliged to tend sheep.  For many long years they drove\ntheir flocks through field and forest and were full of sorrow\nand longing.\nWhen spring had once more broken forth on the earth, they both\nwent out one day with their flocks, and as chance would have it,\nthey drew near each other.  They met in a valley, but did not\nrecognize each other.  Yet they rejoiced that they were no\nlonger so lonely.  Henceforth they each day drove their flocks\nto the same place.  They did not speak much, but they felt\ncomforted.  One evening when the full moon was shining in the\nsky, and the sheep were already at rest, the shepherd pulled\nthe flute out of his pocket, and played on it a beautiful but\nsorrowful air.  When he had finished he saw that the shepherdess\nwas weeping bitterly.  Why are you weeping, he asked.  Alas,\nanswered she, thus shone the full moon when I played this air\non the flute for the last time, and the head of my beloved\nrose out of the water.  He looked at her, and it seemed as if a\nveil fell from his eyes, and he recognized his dear wife, and\nwhen she looked at him, and the moon shone in his face she\nknew him also.  They embraced and kissed each other, and no one\nneed ask if they were happy.\n", "The Poor Boy in the Grave": "There was once a poor shepherd-boy whose father and mother\nwere dead, and he was placed by the authorities in the house\nof a rich man, who was to feed him and bring him up.  The man and\nhis wife, however, had bad hearts, and were greedy and jealous of\ntheir riches, and vexed whenever anyone put a morsel of their\nbread in his mouth.  The poor young fellow might do what he\nliked, he got little to eat, but only so many blows the more.\nOne day he had to watch a hen and her chickens, but she escaped\nthrough a hedge with them, and a hawk darted down instantly,\nand carried her off through the air.  The boy called, thief,\nthief, rascal, with all the strength of his body.  But what good\ndid that do.  The hawk did not bring its prey back again.  The\nman heard the noise, and ran to the spot, and as soon as he\nsaw that his hen was gone, he fell in a rage, and gave the boy\nsuch a beating that he could not stir for two days.  Then he\nhad to take care of the chickens without the hen, but now his\ndifficulty was greater, for one ran here and the other there.\nHe thought he was doing a very wise thing when he tied them\nall together with a string, because then the hawk would not\nbe able to steal any of them away from him.  But he was very\nmuch mistaken.  After two days, worn out with running about and\nhunger, he fell asleep.  The bird of prey came, and seized one\nof the chickens, and as the others were tied fast to it, it\ncarried them all off together, perched itself on a tree, and\ndevoured them.  The farmer was just coming home, and when he saw\nthe misfortune, he got angry and beat the boy so unmercifully\nthat he was forced to lie in bed for several days.\nWhen he was on his legs again, the farmer said to him, you are\ntoo stupid for me, I cannot make a herdsman of you, you must\ngo as errand-boy.  Then he sent him to the judge, to whom he\nwas to carry a basketful of grapes, and he gave him a letter as\nwell.  On the way hunger and thirst tormented the unhappy boy\nso violently that he ate two grapes.  He took the basket to the\njudge, but when the judge had read the letter, and counted the\ngrapes he said, two are missing.  The boy confessed quite honestly\nthat, driven by hunger and thirst, he had devoured the two which\nwere missing.  The judge wrote a letter to the farmer, and asked\nfor the same number of grapes again.  These also the boy had\nto take to him with a letter.  As he again was so extremely\nhungry and thirsty, he could not help it, and again ate two grapes.\nBut first he took the letter out of the basket, put it under a\nstone and seated himself thereon in order that the letter might\nnot see and betray him.  The judge, however, again made him give\nan explanation about the missing grapes.  Ah, said the boy,\nhow have you learnt that.  The letter could not know about it,\nfor I put it under a stone before I did it.  The judge could\nnot help laughing at the boy's simplicity, and sent the man a\nletter wherein he cautioned him to look after the poor boy better,\nand not let him want for meat and drink, and also that he was to\nteach him what was right and what was wrong.\nI will soon show you the difference, said the hard man, if\nyou will eat, you must work, and if you do anything wrong, you\nshall be quite sufficiently taught by blows.\nThe next day he set him a hard task.  He was to chop two bundles\nof hay for food for the horses, and then the man threatened, in\nfive hours, said he, I shall be back again, and if the hay\nis not chopped by that time, I will beat you until you can not\nmove a limb.  The\nfarmer went with his wife, the man-servant and the girl, to the\nyearly fair, and left nothing behind for the boy but a small bit\nof bread.  The boy seated himself on the bench, and began to\nwork with all his might.  As he got warm over it he put his little\ncoat off and threw it on the hay.  In his terror lest he should\nnot get done in time he kept constantly cutting, and in his\nhaste, without noticing it, he chopped his little coat as well as\nthe hay.  He became aware of the misfortune too late.  There was\nno repairing it.  Ah, cried he, now all is over with me.  The\nwicked man did not threaten me for nothing.  If he comes back\nand sees what I have done, he will kill me.  Rather than that I\nwill take my own life.\nThe boy had once heard the farmer's wife say, I have a pot\nwith poison in it under my bed.  She, however, had only said\nthat to keep away greedy people, for there was honey in it.\nThe boy crept under the bed, brought out the pot, and ate all\nthat was in it.  I do not know, said he, folks say death is\nbitter, but it tastes very sweet to me.  It is no wonder\nthat the farmer's wife has so often longed for death.  He seated\nhimself in a little chair, and was prepared to die.  But instead\nof becoming weaker he felt himself strengthened by the nourishing\nfood.  It cannot have been poison, thought he, but the\nfarmer once said there was a small bottle of poison for flies in\nthe closet in which he keeps his clothes.  That, no doubt, will\nbe the true poison, and bring death to me.  It was, however, no\npoison for flies, but hungarian wine.  The boy got out the bottle,\nand emptied it.  This death tastes sweet too, said he, but shortly\nafter when the wine began to mount into his brain and stupefy\nhim, he thought his end was drawing near.  I feel that I must die,\nsaid he, I will go away to the churchyard, and seek a grave.  He\nstaggered out, reached the churchyard, and laid himself in a newly\ndug grave.  He lost his senses more and more.  In the neighborhood\nwas an inn where a wedding was being held.  When he heard the\nmusic, he fancied he was already in paradise, until at length\nhe lost all consciousness.  The poor boy never awoke again.  The\nheat of the strong wine and the cold night-dew deprived him of\nlife, and he remained in the grave in which he had laid himself.\nWhen the farmer heard the news of the boy's death he was terrified,\nand afraid of being brought to justice - indeed, his distress took\nsuch a powerful hold of him that he fell fainting to the ground.\nHis wife, who was standing by the hearth with a pan of hot fat,\nran to him to help him.  But the flames enveloped the pan, the\nwhole house caught fire, in a few hours it lay in ashes, and\nthe rest of the years they had to live they passed in poverty\nand misery, tormented by the pangs of conscience.\n", "The True Sweetheart": "There was once upon a time a girl who was young and beautiful, but\nshe had lost her mother when she was quite a child, and her\nstep-mother did all she could to make the girl's life wretched.\nWhenever this woman gave her anything to do, she worked at it\nindefatigably, and did everything that lay in her\npower.  Still she could not touch the heart of the wicked woman,\nshe was never satisfied, it was never enough.  The harder the girl\nworked, the more work was put upon her, and all that the woman\nthought of was how to weigh her down with still heavier burdens,\nand make her life still more miserable.\nOne day she said to her, here are twelve pounds of feathers which\nyou must pick, and if they are not done this evening, you may\nexpect a good beating.  Do you imagine you are to idle away the\nwhole day.  The poor girl sat down to the work, but tears ran\ndown her cheeks as she did so, for she saw plainly enough that it\nwas quite impossible to finish the work in one day.  Whenever she\nhad a little heap of feathers lying before her, and she sighed or\nsmote her hands together in her anguish, they flew away, and she\nhad to pick them up again, and begin her work anew. Then she put\nher elbows on the table, laid her face in her two hands, and cried,\nis there no one, then, on God's earth to have pity on me.  Then\nshe heard a low voice which said, be comforted, my child, I have\ncome to help you.  The maiden looked up, and an old woman was by\nher side.  She took the girl kindly by the hand, and said, only\ntell me what is troubling you.  As she spoke so kindly, the girl\ntold her of her miserable life, and how one burden after another\nwas laid upon her, and she never could get to the end of the work\nwhich was given to her.  If I have not done these feathers by this\nevening, my step-mother will beat me, she has threatened she will,\nand I know she keeps her word.  Her tears began to flow again, but\nthe good old woman said, do not be afraid, my child, rest a while,\nand in the meantime I will look to your work.  The girl lay\ndown on her bed, and soon fell asleep.  The old woman seated\nherself at the table with the feathers, and how they did fly off\nthe quills, which she scarcely touched with her withered hands.\nThe twelve pounds were soon finished, and when the girl awoke,\ngreat snow-white heaps were lying, piled up, and everything in\nthe room was neatly cleared away, but the old woman had\nvanished.  The maiden thanked God, and sat still till evening\ncame, when the step-mother came in and marveled to see the work\ncompleted.  Just look, you\nawkward creature, said she, what can be done when people are\nindustrious, and why could you not set about something else.\nThere you sit with your hands crossed.  When she went out she\nsaid, the creature is worth more than her salt.  I must give her\nsome work that is still harder.\nNext morning she called the girl, and said there is a spoon for\nyou.  With that you must empty out the great pond which is\nbeside the garden, and if it is not done by night, you know what\nwill happen.  The girl took the spoon, and saw that it was full\nof holes, but even if it had not been, she never could have\nemptied the pond with it.  She set to work at once, knelt down\nby the water, into which her tears were falling, and began to\nempty it.  But the good old woman appeared again, and when she\nlearnt the cause of her grief, she said, be of good cheer, my\nchild.  Go into the thicket and lie down and sleep, I will soon\ndo your work.  As soon as the old woman was alone, she barely\ntouched the pond, and a vapor rose up on high from the water, and\nmingled itself with the clouds.  Gradually the pond was emptied,\nand when the maiden awoke before sunset and came thither, she saw\nnothing but the fishes which were struggling in the mud.  She\nwent to her step-mother, and showed her that the work was done.\nIt ought to have been done long before this, said she, and grew\nwhite with anger, but she meditated something new.\nOn the third morning she said to the girl, you must build me a\ncastle on the plain there, and it must be ready by the\nevening.  The maiden was dismayed, and said, how can I complete\nsuch a great work.  I will endure no opposition, screamed the\nstep-mother.  If you can empty a pond with a spoon that is full of\nholes, you can build a castle too.  I will take possession of\nit this very day, and if anything is wanting, even if it be the\nmost trifling thing in the kitchen or cellar, you know what lies\nbefore you.  She drove the girl out, and when she entered the\nvalley, the rocks were there, piled up one above the other, and\nall her strength would not have enabled her even to move the very\nsmallest of them.  She sat down and wept, and still she hoped the\nold woman would help her.  The old woman was not long in coming,\nshe comforted her and said, lie down\nthere in the shade and sleep, and I will soon build the castle for\nyou.  If it would be a pleasure to you, you can live in it\nyourself.  When the maiden had gone away, the old woman touched the\ngray rocks.  They began to rise, moved together and stood there as\nif giants had built the walls, and on these the building arose\nand it seemed as if countless hands were working invisibly, and\nplacing one stone upon another.  There was a dull heavy noise from\nthe ground, pillars arose of their own accord on high, and\nplaced themselves in order near each other.  The tiles laid\nthemselves in order on the roof, and when noon-day came, the\ngreat weather-cock was already turning itself on the summit of the\ntower, like a golden maid with fluttering garments.  The inside\nof the castle was being finished while evening was drawing near.\nHow the old woman managed it, I know not, but the walls of the\nrooms were hung with silk and velvet, embroidered chairs were\nthere, and richly ornamented arm-chairs by marble tables,\ncrystal chandeliers hung down from the ceilings, and mirrored\nthemselves in the smooth floor, green parrots were there in gilt\ncages, and so were strange birds which sang most beautifully, and\nthere was on all sides as much magnificence as if a king were\ngoing to live there.  The sun was just setting when the girl\nawoke, and the brightness of a thousand lights flashed in her\nface.  She hurried to the castle, and entered by the open door.\nThe steps were spread with red cloth, and the golden\nbalustrade beset with flowering trees.  When she saw the\nsplendor of the rooms, she stood as if turned to stone.  Who\nknows how long she might have stood there if she had not\nremembered the step-mother.  Alas, she said to herself, if she\ncould but be satisfied at last, and would give up making my life\na misery to me.  The girl went and told her that the castle was\nready.  I will move into it at once, said she, and rose from her\nseat.  When they entered the castle, she was forced to hold her\nhand before her eyes, the brilliancy of everything was so\ndazzling.  You see, said she to the girl, how easy it has been\nfor you to do this, I ought to have given you something harder.\nShe went through all the rooms, and examined every corner to\nsee if anything was wanting or defective, but she could\ndiscover nothing.  Now we will go down below, said she, looking\nat the girl with malicious eyes.  The kitchen and the cellar\nstill have to be examined and if you have forgotten anything you\nshall not escape your punishment.  But the fire was burning on\nthe hearth, and the meat was cooking in the pans, the tongs and\nshovel were leaning against the wall, and the shining brazen\nutensils all arranged in sight.  Nothing was missing, not even\na coal-box and a water-pail.  Which is the way to the cellar,\nshe cried.  If that is not abundantly filled with wine casks\nit shall go ill with you.  She herself raised up the trap-door\nand descended, but she had hardly made two steps before the\nheavy trap-door which was only laid back, fell down.  The girl\nheard a scream, lifted up the door very quickly to go to her\naid, but she had fallen down, and the girl found her lying\nlifeless at the bottom.\nAnd now the magnificent castle belonged to the girl alone.  She\nat first did not know how to reconcile herself to her good\nfortune.  Beautiful dresses were hanging in the wardrobes, the\nchests were filled with gold and silver, or with pearls and\njewels, and she never felt a desire that she was not able to\ngratify.  And soon the fame of the beauty and riches of the\nmaiden went over all the world.  Wooers presented themselves\ndaily but none pleased her.  At length the son of the king came\nand he knew how to touch her heart, and she betrothed herself\nto him.  In the garden of the castle was a lime-tree, under\nwhich they were one day sitting together, when he said to her,\nI will go home and obtain my father's consent to our marriage.\nI entreat you to wait for me under this lime-tree, I shall be\nback with you in a few hours.  The maiden kissed him on his\nleft cheek, and said, keep true to me, and never let any one else\nkiss you on this cheek.  I will wait here under the lime-tree\nuntil you return.\nThe maid stayed beneath the lime-tree until sunset, but he did\nnot return.  She sat three days from morning till evening,\nwaiting for him, but in vain.  As he still was not there by the\nfourth day, she said, some accident has assuredly befallen him.\nI will go out and seek him, and will not come back until I have\nfound him.\nShe packed up three of her most beautiful dresses, one embroidered\nwith bright stars, the second with silver moons, the third with\ngolden suns, tied up a handful of jewels in her handkerchief,\nand set out.  She inquired everywhere for her betrothed, but no\none had seen him, no one knew anything about him.  Far and wide\ndid she wander through the world, but she found him not.  At\nlast she hired herself to a farmer as a cowherd, and buried her\ndresses and jewels beneath a stone.\nAnd now she lived as a herdswoman, guarded her herd, and was\nvery sad and full of longing for her beloved.  She had a little\ncalf which she taught to know her, and fed it out of her own\nhand, and when she said,\n     little calf, little calf, kneel by my side,\n     and do not forget your cowherd-maid,\n     as the prince forgot his betrothed bride,\n     who waited for him 'neath the lime-tree's shade.\nThe little calf knelt down, and she stroked it.\nAnd when she had lived for a couple of years alone and full of\ngrief, a report was spread over all the land that the king's\ndaughter was about to celebrate her marriage.  The road to the\ntown passed through the village where the maiden was living, and\nit came to pass that once when the maiden was driving out her\nherd, the bridegroom traveled by.  He was sitting proudly on his\nhorse, and never looked round, but when she saw him she recognized\nher beloved, and it was just as if a sharp knife had pierced her\nheart.  Alas, said she, I believed him true to me, but he has\nforgotten me.\nNext day he again came along the road.  When he was near her\nshe said to the little calf,\n     little calf, little calf, kneel by my side,\n     and do not forget your cowherd-maid,\n     as the prince forgot his betrothed bride,\n     who waited for him 'neath the lime-tree's shade.\nWhen he was aware of the voice, he looked down and reined in\nhis horse.  He looked into the girl's face and then put his hands\nbefore his eyes as if he were trying to remember something, but he\nsoon rode onwards and was out of sight.  Alas, said she, he no\nlonger knows me.  And her grief was ever greater.\nSoon after this a great festival three days long was to be held at\nthe king's court, and the whole country was invited to it.\nNow will I try my last chance, thought the maiden, and when\nevening came she went to the stone under which she had buried her\ntreasures.  She took out the dress with the golden suns, put it on,\nand adorned herself with the jewels.  She let down her hair, which\nshe had concealed under a handkerchief, and it fell down in long\ncurls about her, and thus she went into the town, and in the\ndarkness was observed by no one.  When she entered the brightly\nlighted hall, every one started back in amazement, but no one knew\nwho she was.  The king's son went to meet her, but he did not\nrecognize her.  He led her out to dance, and was so enchanted with\nher beauty, that he thought no more of the other bride.  When the\nfeast was over, she vanished in the crowd, and hastened before\ndaybreak to the village, where she once more put on her herd's\ndress.\nNext evening she took out the dress with the silver moons, and\nput a half-moon made of precious stones in her hair.  When she\nappeared at the festival, all eyes were turned upon her, but the\nking's son hastened to meet her, and filled with love for her,\ndanced with her alone, and no longer so much as glanced at anyone\nelse.  Before she went away she was forced to promise him to\ncome again to the festival on the last evening.\nWhen she appeared for the third time, she wore the star-dress\nwhich sparkled at every step she took, and her hair-ribbon and\ngirdle were starred with jewels.  The prince had already been\nwaiting for her for a long time, and forced his way up to her.\nDo but tell who you are, said he, I feel just as if I had already\nknown you a long time.  Do you not know what I did when you left\nme.  Then she stepped up to him, and kissed him on his left cheek,\nand in a moment it was as if scales fell from his eyes, and he\nrecognized the true bride.  Come, said he to her, here I stay no\nlonger, gave her his hamd, and led her down to the carriage.  The\nhorses hurried\naway to the magic castle as if the wind had been harnessed to the\ncarriage.  The illuminated windows already shone in the distance.\nWhen they drove past the lime-tree, countless glow-worms were\nswarming about it.  It shook its branches, and sent forth their\nfragrance.  On the steps flowers were blooming, and the room\nechoed with the song of strange birds, but in the hall the entire\ncourt was assembled, and the priest was waiting to marry the\nbridegroom and the true bride.\n", "The Spindle, the Shuttle, and the Needle": "There was once a girl whose father and mother died while\nshe was still a little child.  All alone, in a small house at the\nend of the village, dwelt her godmother, who supported herself\nby spinning, weaving, and sewing.  The old woman took the\nforlorn child to live with her, kept her to her work, and educated\nher in all that is good.  When the girl was fifteen years old,\nthe old woman became ill, called the child to her bedside,\nand said, dear daughter, I feel my end drawing near.  I leave you\nthe little house, which will protect you from wind and weather, and\nmy spindle, shuttle, and needle, with which you can earn your\nbread.  Then she laid her hands on the girl's head, blessed her,\nand said, only preserve the love of God in your heart, and all will\ngo well with you.  Thereupon she closed her eyes, and when she was\nlaid in the earth, the maiden followed the coffin, weeping\nbitterly, and paid her the last mark of respect.\nAnd now the maiden lived quite alone in the little house, and\nwas industrious, and spun, wove, and sewed, and the blessing of the\ngood old woman was on all that she did.  It seemed as if the flax\nin the room increased of its own accord, and whenever she wove a\npiece of cloth or carpet, or had made a shirt, she at once found\na buyer who paid her amply for it, so that she was in want of\nnothing, and even had something to share with others.\nAbout this time, the son of the king was traveling about the\ncountry looking for a bride.  He was not to choose a poor one, and\ndid not want to have a rich one.  So he said, she shall be my wife\nwho is the poorest, and at the same time the richest.  When he came\nto the village where the maiden dwelt, he inquired, as he did\nwherever he went, who was the richest and also the poorest girl in\nthe place.  They first named the richest.  The poorest, they said,\nwas the girl who lived in the small house quite at the end of the\nvillage.  The rich girl was sitting in all her splendor before the\ndoor of her house, and when the prince approached her, she got up,\nwent to meet him, and made him a low curtsy.  He looked at her,\nsaid nothing, and rode on.  When he came to the house of the poor\ngirl, she was not standing at the door, but sitting in her little\nroom.  He stopped his horse, and saw through the window, on which\nthe bright sun was shining, the girl sitting at her spinning-wheel,\nbusily spinning.  She looked up, and when she saw that the prince\nwas looking in, she blushed all over her face, let her eyes fall,\nand went on spinning.  I do not know whether, just at that\nmoment, the thread was quite even, but she went on spinning until\nthe king's son had ridden away again.  Then she went to the\nwindow, opened it, and said, it is so warm in this room, and she\nlooked after him as long as she could distinguish the white\nfeathers in his hat.  Then she sat down to work again in her room\nand went on with her spinning, and a saying which the old woman\nhad often repeated when she was\nsitting at her work, came into her mind, and she sang these\nwords to herself,\n     spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away,\n     and here to my house bring the wooer, I pray.\nAnd what do you think happened.  The spindle sprang out of her\nhand in an instant, and out of the door, and when, in her\nastonishment, she got up and looked after it, she saw that it was\ndancing out merrily into the open country, and drawing a shining\ngold thread after it.  Before long, it had entirely vanished from\nher sight.  As she had now no spindle, the girl took the weaver's\nshuttle in her hand, sat down to her loom, and began to weave.\nThe spindle, however, danced continually onwards, and just as\nthe thread came to an end, reached the prince.  What do I see, he\ncried, the spindle certainly wants to show me the way, turned\nhis horse about, and rode back with the golden thread.  The girl\nhowever, was sitting at her work singing,\n     shuttle, my shuttle, weave well this day,\n     and guide the wooer to me, I pray.\nImmediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door.\nBefore the threshold, however, it began to weave a carpet which\nwas more beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet beheld.\nLilies and roses blossomed on both sides of it, and on a golden\nground in the center green branches ascended, under which bounded\nhares and rabbits, stags and deer stretched their heads in\nbetween them, brightly-colored birds were sitting in the branches\nabove, they lacked nothing but the gift of song.  The shuttle\nleapt hither and thither, and everything seemed to grow of\nits own accord.\nAs the shuttle had run away, the girl sat down to sew.  She held\nthe needle in her hand and sang,\n     needle, my needle, sharp-pointed and fine,\n     prepare for the wooer this house of mine.\nThen the needle leapt out of her fingers, and flew everywhere\nabout the room as quick as lightning.  It was just as if\ninvisible spirits were working, it covered tables and benches\nwith green cloth in an instant,\nand the chairs with velvet, and hung the windows with silken\ncurtains.  Hardly had the needle put in the last stitch than the\nmaiden saw through the window the white feathers of the prince,\nwhom the spindle had brought thither by the golden thread.  He\nalighted, stepped over the carpet into the house, and when he\nentered the room, there stood the maiden in her poor garments, but\nshe shone out from within them like a rose surrounded by leaves.\nYou are the poorest and also the richest, said he to her.  Come\nwith me, you shall be my bride.  She did not speak, but she gave\nhim her hand.  Then he gave her a kiss, led her forth, lifted her\non to his horse, and took her to the royal castle, where the\nwedding was solemnized with great rejoicings.  The spindle,\nshuttle, and needle were preserved in the treasure-chamber,\nand held in great honor.\n", "The Sea-Hare": "There was once upon a time a princess, who, high under the\nbattlements in her castle, had an apartment with twelve windows,\nwhich looked out in every possible direction, and when she climbed\nup to it and looked around her, she could inspect her whole kingdom.\nWhen she looked out of the first, her sight was more keen than that\nof any other human being, from the second she could see still\nbetter, from the third more distinctly still, and so it went on,\nuntil the twelfth, from which she saw everything above the earth\nand under the earth, and nothing at all could be\nkept secret from her.  Moreover, as she was haughty, and would be\nsubject to no one, but wished to keep the dominion for herself\nalone, she caused it to be proclaimed that no one should ever be\nher husband who could not conceal himself from her so effectively,\nthat it should be quite impossible for her to find him.  He who\ntried this, however, and was discovered by her, was to have his\nhead struck off, and stuck on a post.  Ninety-seven posts with the\nheads of dead men were already standing before the castle, and no\none had come forward for a long time.  The princess was delighted,\nand thought to herself, now I shall be free as long as I live.\nThen three brothers appeared before her, and announced to her\nthat they were desirous of trying their luck.  The eldest believed\nhe would be quite safe if he crept into a lime-pit, but she saw\nhim from the first window, made him come out, and had his head\ncut off.  The second crept into the cellar of the palace, but she\nperceived him also from the first window, and his fate was sealed.\nHis head was placed on the nine and ninetieth post.  Then the\nyoungest came to her and entreated her to give him a day for\nconsideration, and also to be so gracious as to overlook it if she\nshould happen to discover him twice, but if he failed the third\ntime, he would look on his life as over.  As he was so handsome,\nand begged so earnestly, she said, yes, I will grant you that, but\nyou will not succeed.\nNext day he meditated for a long time how he should hide\nhimself, but all in vain.  Then he seized his gun and went out\nhunting.  He saw a raven, took a good aim at him, and was just\ngoing to fire, when the bird cried, don't shoot, I will reward\nyou.  He put his gun down, went on, and came to a lake where he\nsurprised a large fish which had come up from the depths below\nto the surface of the water.  When he had aimed at it, the fish\ncried, don't shoot, and I will reward you.  He allowed it to dive\ndown again, went onwards, and met a fox which was lame.  He\nfired and missed it, and the fox cried, you had much better come\nhere and draw the thorn out of my foot for me.  He did this, but\nwhen he wanted to kill the fox and skin it, the fox said, stop,\nand I will reward you.  The youth let him go, and then as it\nwas evening, returned home.\nNext day he was to hide himself, but no matter how he puzzled\nhis brains over it, he did not know where.  He went into the\nforest to the raven and said, I let you live on, so now tell me\nwhere I am to hide myself, so that the king's daughter will not\nsee me.  The raven hung his head and thought it over for a long\ntime.  At length he croaked, I have it.  He fetched an egg out of\nhis nest, cut it into two parts, and shut the youth inside it,\nthen made it whole again, and seated himself on it.  When the\nking's daughter went to the first window she could not discover\nhim, nor could she from the others, and she began to be uneasy,\nbut from the eleventh she saw him.  She ordered the raven to be\nshot, and the egg to be brought and broken, and the youth was\nforced to come out.  She said, for once you are excused, but if\nyou do not better than this, you are lost.  Next day he went to\nthe lake, called the fish to him and said, I suffered you to live,\nnow tell me where to hide myself so that the king's daughter\nmay not see me.  The fish thought for a while, and at last\ncried, I have it, I will shut you up in my stomach.  He\nswallowed him, and went down to the bottom of the lake.  The\nking's daughter looked through her windows, and even from the\neleventh did not see him, and was alarmed, but at length from\nthe twelfth she saw him.  She ordered the fish to be caught and\nkilled, and then the youth appeared.  It is easy to imagine the\nstate of mind he was in.  She said, twice you are forgiven, but\nbe sure that your head will be set on the hundredth post.\nOn the last day, he went with a heavy heart into the country, and\nmet the fox.  You know how to find all kinds of hiding-places,\nsaid he, I let you live, now advise me where I shall hide myself\nso that\nthe king's daughter shall not discover me.  That's a hard task,\nanswered the fox, looking very thoughtful.  At length he cried,\nI have it, and went with him to a spring, dipped himself in it,\nand came out as a stall-keeper in the market, and dealer in\nanimals.  The youth had to dip himself in the water also, and\nwas changed into a small sea-hare.  The merchant went into the\ntown, and showed the pretty little animal, and many persons\ngathered together to see it.  At length the king's daughter\ncame likewise, and as she liked it very much, she bought it,\nand gave the merchant a good deal of money for it.  Before he\ngave it over to her, he said to it, when the king's daughter goes\nto the window, creep quickly under the braids of her her hair.\nAnd now the time arrived when she was to search for him.  She\nwent to one window after another in turn, from the first to the\neleventh, and did not see him.  When she did not see him from the\ntwelfth either, she was full of anxiety and anger, and shut it\ndown with such violence that the glass in every window shivered\ninto a thousand pieces, and the whole castle shook.\nShe went back and felt the sea-hare beneath the braids of her\nhair.  Then she seized it, and threw it on the ground exclaiming,\naway with you, get out of my sight.  It ran to the merchant, and\nboth of them hurried to the spring, wherein they plunged, and\nreceived back their true forms.  The youth thanked the fox, and\nsaid, the raven and the fish are idiots compared with you, you\nknow the right tune to play, there is no denying that.\nThe youth went straight to the palace.  The princess was already\nexpecting him, and abandoned herself to her fate.  The wedding\nwas solemnized, and now he was king, and lord of all the kingdom.\nHe never told her where he had concealed himself for the third\ntime, and who had helped him, so she believed that he had done\neverything by his own skill, and she had a great respect for him,\nfor she thought to herself, he is able to do more than I.\n", "The Master-Thief": "One day an old man and his wife were sitting in front of a\nmiserable house resting a while from their work.  Suddenly\na splendid carriage with four black horses came driving up,\nand a richly-dressed man descended from it.  The peasant stood\nup, went to the great man, and asked what he wanted, and in what\nway he could serve him.  The stranger stretched out his hand to\nthe old man, and said, I want nothing but to enjoy for once a\ncountry dish, cook me some potatoes, in the way you always have\nthem, and then I will sit down at your table and eat them with\npleasure.  The peasant smiled and said, you are a count or a\nprince, or perhaps even a duke, noble gentlemen often have such\nfancies, but you shall have your wish.  The wife then went into\nthe kitchen and began to wash and rub the potatoes, and to make\nthem into balls, as they are eaten by the country-folks.  Whilst\nshe was busy with this work, the peasant said to the stranger,\ncome into my garden with me for a while, I have still something\nto do there.  He had dug some holes in the garden, and now\nwanted to plant trees in them.  Have you no children, asked the\nstranger, who could help you with your work.  No, answered the\npeasant, I had a son, it is true, but it is long since he went\nout into the world.  He was a ne'er-do-well, clever and knowing,\nbut he would learn nothing and was full of bad tricks.  At last\nhe ran away from me, and since then I have heard nothing of him.\nThe old man took a young tree, put it in a hole, drove in a post\nbeside it, and when he had shovelled in some earth and had\ntrampled it firmly down, he tied the stem of the tree above,\nbelow, and in the middle, fast to the post by a rope of straw.\nBut tell me,\nsaid the stranger, why you don't tie that crooked knotted tree,\nwhich is lying in the corner there, bent down almost to the ground,\nto a post also that it may grow straight, as well as these.  The\nold man smiled and said, sir, you speak according to your knowledge,\nit is easy to see that you are not familiar with gardening.  That\ntree there is old, and mis-shapen, no one can make it straight now.\nTrees must be trained while they are young.  That is how it was\nwith your son, said the stranger, if you had trained him while\nhe was still young, he would not have run away.  Now he too must\nhave grown hard and mis-shapen.  Truly it is a long time since he\nwent away, replied the old man, he must have changed.  Would you\nknow him again if he were to come to you, asked the stranger.\nHardly by his face, replied the peasant, but he has a mark about\nhim, a birth-mark on his shoulder, that looks like a bean.  When\nhe had said that the stranger pulled off his coat, bared his\nshoulder, and showed the peasant the bean.  Good God, cried the\nold man, you are really my son, and love for his child stirred\nin his heart.  But, he added, how can you be my son, you have\nbecome a great lord and live in wealth and luxury.  How have you\ncontrived to do that.  Ah, father, answered the son, the young\ntree was bound to no post and has grown crooked.  Now it is too\nold, it will never be straight again.  How have I come by all this.\nI have become a thief, but do not be alarmed, I am a master-thief.\nFor me there are neither locks nor bolts, whatsoever I desire is\nmine.  Do not imagine that I steal like a common thief, I only\ntake some of the superfluity of the rich.  Poor people are safe,\nI would rather give to them than take anything from them.  It is\nthe same with anything which I can have without trouble, cunning,\nand dexterity - I never touch it.  Alas, my son, said the father,\nit still does not please me, a thief is still a thief, I tell you\nit will end badly.  He took him to his mother, and when she heard\nthat was her son, she wept for joy, but when he told her that he\nhad become a master-thief, two streams flowed down over her\nface.  At length she said, even if he has become a thief, he is\nstill my son, and my eyes have beheld him once more.\nThey sat down to table, and once again he ate with his parents\nthe wretched food which he had not eaten for so long.  The father\nsaid, if our lord, the count up there in the castle, learns who\nyou are, and what trade you follow, he will not take you in his\narms and cradle you in them as he did when he held you at the font,\nbut will cause you to swing from a halter.  Be easy, father, he\nwill do me no harm, for I understand my trade.  I will go to him\nmyself this very day.  When evening drew near, the master-thief\nseated himself in his carriage, and drove to the castle.  The\ncount received him civilly, for he took him for a distinguished\nman.  When, however, the stranger made himself known, the count\nturned pale and was quite silent for some time.  At length he\nsaid, you are my godson, and on that account mercy shall take\nthe place of justice, and I will deal leniently with you.  Since\nyou pride yourself on being a master-thief, I will put your art\nto the proof, but if you do not stand the test, you must marry\nthe rope-maker's daughter, and the croaking of the raven must be\nyour music on the occasion.  Lord count, answered the\nmaster-thief, think of three things, as difficult as you like,\nand if I do not perform your tasks, do with me what you will.\nThe count reflected for some minutes, and then said, well, then,\nin the first place, you shall steal the horse I keep for my own\nriding, out of the stable.  In the next, you shall steal the\nsheet from beneath the bodies of my wife and myself when we are\nasleep, without our observing it, and the wedding-ring of my wife\nas well.  Thirdly and lastly, you shall steal away out of the\nchurch, the parson and clerk.  Mark what I am saying, for\nyour life depends on it.\nThe master-thief went to the nearest town, there he bought the\nclothes of an old peasant woman, and put them on.  Then he stained\nhis face brown, and painted wrinkles on it as well, so that no one\ncould have recognized him.  Then he filled a small cask with old\nhungary wine in which was mixed a powerful sleeping-drink.  He\nput the cask in a basket, which he took on his back, and walked\nwith slow and tottering steps to the count's castle.  It was\nalready dark when he arrived.  He sat down on a stone in the\ncourt-yard and began to cough, like an asthmatic old woman, and to\nrub his hands as if he were cold.  In front of the door of the\nstable some soldiers were\nlying round a fire, one of them observed the woman, and called out\nto her, come nearer, old mother, and warm yourself beside us.\nAfter all, you have no bed for the night, and must take one where\nyou can find it.  The old woman tottered up to them, begged them\nto lift the basket from her back, and sat down beside them at the\nfire.  What have you got in your little cask, old hag, asked one.\nA good mouthful of wine, she answered.  I live by trade, for\nmoney and fair words I am quite ready to let you have a glass.\nLet us have it here, then, said the soldier, and when he had\ntasted one glass he said, when wine is good, I like another glass,\nand had another poured out for himself, and the rest followed his\nexample.  Hallo, comrades, cried one of them to those who were in\nthe stable, here is an old girl who has wine that is as old as\nherself, take a draught, it will warm your stomachs far better\nthan our fire.  The old woman carried her cask into the stable.\nOne of the soldiers had seated himself on the saddled riding-horse,\nanother held its bridle in his hand, a third had laid hold of\nits tail.  She poured out as much as they wanted until the spring\nran dry.  It was not long before the bridle fell from the hand of\nthe one, and he fell down and began to snore, the other left hold\nof the tail, lay down and snored still louder.  The one who was\nsitting in the saddle, did remain sitting, but bent his head down\nalmost to the horse's neck, and slept and blew with his mouth like\nthe bellows of a forge.  The soldiers outside had already been\nasleep for a long time, and were lying on the ground motionless,\nas if dead.  When the master-thief saw that he had succeeded, he\ngave the first a rope in his hand instead of the bridle, and the\nother who had been holding the tail, a wisp of straw, but what was\nhe to do with the one who was sitting on the horse's back.  He\ndid not want to throw him down, for he might have awakened and\nhave uttered a cry.  He had a good idea, he unbuckled the girths\nof the saddle, tied a couple of ropes which were hanging to a ring\non the wall fast to the saddle, and drew the sleeping rider up\ninto the air on it, then he twisted the rope round the posts, and\nmade it fast.  He soon unloosed the horse from the chain, but if\nhe had ridden over the stony pavement of the yard they would have\nheard the noise in the castle.  So he wrapped the horse's hoofs in\nold rags, led him carefully out, leapt upon him, and\ngalloped off.\nWhen day broke, the master galloped to the castle on the stolen\nhorse.  The count had just got up, and was looking out of the\nwindow.  Good morning, sir count, he cried to him, here is the\nhorse, which I have got safely out of the stable.  Just look, how\nbeautifully your soldiers are lying there sleeping, and if you will\nbut go into the stable, you will see how comfortable your\nwatchers have made it for themselves.  The count could not help\nlaughing.  Then he said, for once you have succeeded, but things\nwon't go so well the second time, and I warn you that if you come\nbefore me as a thief, I will handle you as I would a thief.\nWhen the countess went to bed that night, she closed her hand\nwith the wedding-ring tightly together, and the count said, all\nthe doors are locked and bolted, I will keep awake and wait for\nthe thief, but if he gets in by the window, I will shoot him.\nThe master-thief, however, went in the dark to the gallows, cut a\npoor sinner who was hanging there down from the halter, and\ncarried him on his back to the castle.  Then he set a ladder up\nto the bedroom, put the dead body on his shoulders, and began to\nclimb up.  When he had got so high that the head of the dead man\nshowed at the window, the count, who was watching in his bed,\nfired a pistol at him, and immediately the master let the poor\nsinner fall down, descended the ladder, and hid himself in one\ncorner.  The night was sufficiently lighted by the moon, for the\nmaster to see distinctly how the count got out of the window on to\nthe ladder, came down, carried the dead body into the garden, and\nbegan to dig a hole in which to lay it.  Now, thought the thief,\nthe favorable moment has come, stole nimbly out of his corner, and\nclimbed up the ladder straight into the countess's bedroom.  Dear\nwife, he began in the count's voice, the thief is dead, but, after\nall, he is my godson, and has been more of a scape-grace than a\nvillain.  I will not put him to open shame, besides, I am sorry\nfor the parents.  I will bury him myself before daybreak in the\ngarden, that the thing may not be known.  So give me the sheet,\nI will wrap up the body in it, and not bury him like a dog.  The\ncountess gave him the sheet.  I tell you what, continued the\nthief, I have a fit of magnanimity, give me the ring too, - the\nunhappy man risked his life for it, so he may take it with him\ninto his grave.  She would not gainsay the count, and although\nshe did it unwillingly she drew the ring from her finger, and\ngave it to him.  The thief made off with both these things, and\nreached home safely before the count in the garden had finished\nhis work of burying.\nWhat a long face the count did pull when the master came next\nmorning, and brought him the sheet and the ring.  Are you a\nwizard, said he, who has fetched you out of the grave in which\nI myself laid you, and brought you to life again.  You did not\nbury me, said the thief, but the poor sinner on the gallows,\nand he told him exactly how everything had happened, and the count\nwas forced to own to him that he was a clever, crafty thief.\nBut you have not reached the end yet, he added, you have still to\nperform the third task, and if you do not succeed in that, all is\nof no use.  The master smiled and returned no answer.\nWhen night had fallen he went with a long sack on his back, a\nbundle under his arms, and a lantern in his hand to the village\nchurch.  In the sack he had some crabs, and in the bundle short\nwax-candles.  He sat down in the churchyard, took out a crab, and\nstuck a  wax-candle on his back.  Then he lighted the little light,\nput the crab on the ground, and let it creep about.  He took a\nsecond out of the sack, and treated it in the same way, and so on\nuntil the last was out of the sack.  Hereupon he put on a long\nblack garment that looked like a monk's cowl, and stuck a gray\nbeard on his chin.  When at last he was quite unrecognizable, he\ntook the sack in which the crabs had been, went into the church,\nand ascended the pulpit.  The clock in the tower was just striking\ntwelve, when the last stroke had sounded, he cried with a loud\nand piercing voice, hearken, sinful men, the end of all things\nhas come.  The last day is at hand.  Hearken.  Hearken.\nWhosoever wishes to go to heaven with me must creep into the sack.\nI am peter, who opens and shuts the gate of heaven.  Behold how\nthe dead outside there in the chuchyard are wandering about\ncollecting their bones.  Come, come, and creep into the sack, the\nworld is about to be destroyed.  The cry echoed through the whole\nvillage.  The parson and clerk who lived nearest to the church,\nheard it first, and when they saw the lights which were moving\nabout the churchyard, they observed that something unusual was\ngoing on, and went into the church.  They listened to the sermon\nfor a while, and then the clerk nudged the parson and said, it\nwould not be amiss if we were to use the opportunity together, and\nbefore the dawning of the last day, find an easy way of getting\nto heaven.  To tell the truth, answered the parson, that is what I\nmyself have been thinking, so if you are inclined, we will set out\non our way.  Yes, answered the clerk, but you, the pastor, have\nthe precedence, I will follow.  So the parson went first, and\nascended the pulpit where the master opened his\nsack.  The parson crept in first, and then the clerk.  The master\nimmediately tied up the sack tightly, seized it by the middle, and\ndragged it down the pulpit-steps, and whenever the heads of the\ntwo fools bumped against the steps, he cried, we are going over\nthe mountains.  Then he drew them through the village in the same\nway, and when they were passing through puddles, he cried, now\nwe are going through wet clouds.  And when at last he was dragging\nthem up the steps of the castle, he cried, now we are on the\nsteps of heaven, and will soon be in the outer court.  When he had\ngot to the top, he pushed the sack into the pigeon-house, and when\nthe pigeons fluttered about, he said, hark how glad the angels are,\nand how they are flapping their wings.  Then he bolted the door\nupon them, and went away.\nNext morning he went to the count, and told him that he had\nperformed the third task also, and had carried the parson and clerk\nout of the church.  Where have you left them, asked the Lord.\nThey are lying upstairs in a sack in the pigeon-house, and\nimagine that they are in heaven.  The count went up himself, and\nconvinced himself that the master had told the truth.  When he had\ndelivered the parson and clerk from their captivity, he said, you\nare an arch-thief, and have won your wager.  For once you escape\nwith a whole skin, but see that you leave my land, for if ever you\nset foot on it again, you may count on your elevation to the\ngallows.  The arch-thief took leave of his parents, once more\nwent forth into the wide world, and no one has ever heard of\nhim since.\n", "The Drummer": "A young drummer went out quite alone one evening into the country,\nand came to a lake on the shore of which he perceived lying there\nthree pieces of white linen.  What fine linen, said he, and put one\npiece in his pocket.  He returned home, thought no more of what he\nhad found, and went to bed.  Just as he was going to sleep, it\nseemed to him as if someone was calling his name.  He listened,\nand was aware of a soft voice which cried to him, drummer, drummer,\nwake up.  As it was a dark night he could see no one, but it\nappeared to him that a figure was hovering about his bed.  What\ndo you want, he asked.  Give me back my shift, answered the voice,\nthat you took away from me last evening by the lake.  You shall have\nit back again, said the drummer, if you will tell me who you are.\nAh, replied the voice, I am the daughter of a mighty king.  But I\nhave fallen into the power of a witch, and am shut up on the\nglass-mountain.  I have to bathe in the lake every day with my\ntwo sisters, but I cannot fly back again without my shift.  My\nsisters have gone away, but I have been forced to stay behind.  I\nentreat you to give me my shift back.  Don't worry, poor child,\nsaid the drummer.  I will willingly give it back to you.  He took\nit out of his pocket, and reached it to her in the dark.  She\nsnatched it in haste, and wanted to go away with it.  Stop a\nmoment, perhaps I can help you.  You can only help me by ascending\nthe glass-mountain, and indeed if you were quite close to it you\ncould not ascend it.  When I want to do a thing I always can do\nit, said the drummer.  I am sorry for you, and have no fear of\nanything.  But I do not know the way which leads to the\nglass-mountain.  The road goes through the great\nforest, in which the man-eaters live, she answered, and more than\nthat, I dare not tell you.  And then he heard her wings as she flew\naway.\nBy daybreak the drummer arose, buckled on his drums, and went\nwithout fear straight into the forest.  After he had walked for\na while without seeing any giants, he thought to himself, I\nmust waken up the sluggards, and he hung his drum before him,\nand beat such a roll that the birds flew out of the trees with\nloud cries.  It was not long before a giant who had been lying\nsleeping among the grass, rose up, and was as tall as a fir-tree.\nWretch, cried he, what are you drumming here for, and wakening\nme out of my best sleep.  I am drumming, he replied, because\nI want to show the way to many thousands who are following me.\nWhat do they want in my forest, demanded the giant.  They want\nto put an end to you, and cleanse the forest of such a monster\nas you.  Oho.  Said the giant, I will trample you all to death\nlike so many ants.  Do you think you can do anything against us,\nsaid the drummer, if you stoop to take hold of one, he will jump\naway and hide himself.  But when you are lying down and sleeping,\nthey will come forth from every thicket, and creep up to you.\nEvery one of them has a hammer of steel in his belt, and with\nthat they will beat in your skull.  The giant grew angry and\nthought, if I meddle with the crafty folk, it might turn out\nbadly for me.  I can strangle wolves and bears, but I cannot\nprotect myself from these earth-worms.  Listen, little fellow,\nsaid he, go back again, and I will promise you that for the\nfuture I will leave you and your comrades in peace, and if there\nis anything else you wish for, tell me, for I am quite willing\nto do something to please you.  You have long legs, said\nthe drummer, and can run quicker than I.  Carry me to the\nglass-mountain, and I will give my followers a signal to go\nback, and they shall leave you in peace this time.  Come here,\nworm, said the giant.  Seat yourself on my shoulder, I will carry\nyou where you wish to be.  The giant lifted him up, and the\ndrummer began to beat his drum up aloft to his heart's delight.\nThe giant thought, that is the signal for the other people to\nturn back.\nAfter a while, a second giant was standing in the road, who took\nthe drummer from the first, and stuck him in his button-hole.\nThe drummer laid hold of the button, which was as large as a\ndish, held on by it, and looked merrily around.  Then they came\nto a third giant, who took him out of the button-hole, and set\nhim on the rim of his hat.  Up there the drummer walked backwards\nand forwards, and looked over the trees, and when he perceived\na mountain in the blue distance, he thought, that must be the\nglass-mountain, and so it was.  The giant only made two more\nsteps, and they reached the foot of the mountain, where the\ngiant put him down.  The drummer demanded to be put on the\nsummit of the glass-mountain, but the giant shook his head,\ngrowled something in his beard, and went back into the forest.\nAnd now the poor drummer was standing before the mountain, which\nwas as high as if three mountains were piled on each other, and\nat the same time as smooth as a looking-glass, and did not know\nhow to get up it.  He began to climb, but that was useless, for\nhe always slipped back again.  If one was a bird now, thought\nhe.  But what was the good of wishing, no wings grew for him.\nWhilst he was standing thus, not knowing what to do, he saw, not\nfar from him, two men who were struggling fiercely together.  He\nwent up to them and saw that they were disputing about a saddle\nwhich was lying on the ground before them, and which both of them\nwanted to have.  What fools you are, said he, to quarrel about\na saddle, when you have not a horse for it.  The saddle is\nworth fighting about, answered one of the men.  Whosoever\nsits on it, and wishes himself in any place, even if it should\nbe the very end of the earth, gets there the instant he has uttered\nthe wish.  The saddle belongs to us in common.  It is my turn\nto ride on it, but that other man will not let me do it.  I\nwill soon decide the quarrel, said the drummer, and he went\nto a short distance and stuck a white rod in the ground.  Then\nhe came back and said, now run to the goal, and whoever gets\nthere first, shall ride first.  Both set out at a trot, but\nhardly had they gone a couple of steps before the drummer swung\nhimself on the saddle, wished himself on the glass-mountain\nand before any one could turn round, he was there.  On the\ntop of the mountain was a plain.  There stood an old stone house,\nand in front of the house lay a great fish-pond, but behind it was\na dark forest.  He saw neither men nor animals, everything was\nquiet.  Only the wind rustled amongst the trees, and the clouds\nmoved by quite close above his head.  He went to the door and\nknocked.  When he had knocked for the third time, an old woman\nwith a brown face and red eyes opened the door.  She had\nspectacles on her long nose, and looked sharply at him.  Then\nshe asked what he wanted.  Entrance, food, and a bed for the\nnight, replied the drummer.  That you shall have, said the old\nwoman, if you will perform three services in return.  Why not,\nhe answered, I am not afraid of any kind of work, however, hard\nit may be.  The old woman let him go in, and gave him some food\nand a good bed at night.  The next morning when he had slept\nhis fill, she took a thimble from her wrinkled finger, reached\nit to the drummer, and said, go to work now, and empty out the\npond with this thimble.  But you must have done it before night,\nand must have sought out all the fishes which are in the water\nand laid them side by side, according to their kind and size.\nThat is strange work, said the drummer, but he went to the pond,\nand began to empty it.  He baled the whole morning.  But what\ncan anyone do to a great lake with a thimble, even if he were\nto bale for a thousand years.\nWhen it was noon, he thought, it is all useless, and whether I\nwork or not it will come to the same thing.  So he gave it up\nand sat down.  Then came a maiden out of the house who set a\nlittle basket with food before him, and said, what ails you,\nthat you sit so sadly here.  He looked at her, and saw that\nshe was wondrously beautiful.  Ah, said he, I cannot finish\nthe first piece of work, how will it be with the others.  I\ncame forth to seek a king's daughter who is said to dwell here,\nbut I have not found her, and I will go farther.  Stay here,\nsaid the maiden, I will help you out of your difficulty.  You\nare tired, lay your head in my lap, and sleep.  When you awake\nagain, your work will be done.  The drummer did not\nneed to be told that twice.  As soon as his eyes were shut,\nshe turned a wishing-ring and said, rise, water.  Fishes, come out.\nInstantly the water rose on high like a white mist, and moved\naway with the other clouds, and the fishes sprang on the shore\nand laid themselves side by side each according to his size and\nkind.  When the drummer awoke, he saw with amazement that all\nwas done.  But the maiden said, one of the fish is not lying\nwith those of its own kind, but quite alone.  When the old\nwoman comes to-night and sees that all she demanded has been\ndone, she will ask you, what is this fish lying alone for.\nThen throw the fish in her face, and say, this one shall be\nfor you, old witch.  In the evening the witch came, and when\nshe had put this question, he threw the fish in her face.  She\nbehaved as if she did not notice it, and said nothing, but\nlooked at him with malicious eyes.  Next morning she said,\nyesterday it was too easy for you, I must give you harder work.\nTo-day you must hew down the whole of the forest, split the wood\ninto logs, and pile them up, and everything must be finished\nby the evening.  She gave him an axe, a mallet, and two wedges.\nBut the axe was made of lead, and the mallet and wedges were of\ntin.  When he began to cut, the edge of the axe was blunted,\nand the mallet and wedges were beaten out of shape.  He did\nnot know how to manage, but at mid-day the maiden came once more\nwith his dinner and comforted him.  Lay your head on my lap,\nsaid she, and sleep.  When you awake, your work will be done.\nShe turned her wishing-ring, and in an instant the whole forest\nfell down with a crash, the wood split, and arranged itself\nin heaps, and it seemed just as if unseen giants were finishing\nthe work.  When he awoke, the maiden said, do you see that the\nwood is piled up and arranged, one bough alone remains.  But\nwhen the old woman comes this evening and asks you about that\nbough, give her a blow with it, and say, that is for you,\nyou witch.\nThe old woman came, there you see how easy the work was,\nsaid she.  But for whom have you left that bough.  For you,\nyou witch, he replied, and gave her a blow with it.  But she\npretended not to feel it, laughed scornfully, and said, early\nto-morrow morning you shall arrange all the wood in one heap,\nset fire to it, and burn it.  He rose at break of day, and began\nto pick up the wood, but how can a single man get a whole forest\ntogether.  The work made no progress.  The maiden, however,\ndid not desert him in his need.  She brought him his food at\nnoon, and when he had eaten, he laid his head on her lap, and\nwent to sleep.  When he awoke, the entire pile of wood was\nburning in one enormous flame, which stretched its tongues\nout into the sky.  Listen to me, said the maiden, when the witch\ncomes, she will give you all kinds of orders.  Do whatever she\nasks you without fear, and then she will not be able to get the\nbetter of you, but if you are afraid, the fire will lay hold\nof you, and consume you.  At last when you have done everything,\nseize her with both your hands, and throw her into the midst\nof the fire.  The maiden departed, and the old woman came\nsneaking up to him.  Oh, I am cold, said she, but that is a fire\nthat burns.  It warms my old bones, and does me good.  But I\nsee a log lying there which won't burn, bring it out for me.\nWhen you have done that, you are free, and may go where you\nlike.  Now, jump in.\nThe drummer did not reflect long.  He sprang into the midst of\nthe flames, but they did not hurt him, and could not even singe\na hair of his head.  He carried the log out, and laid it\ndown.  Hardly, however, had the wood touched the earth than it was\ntransformed, and the beautiful maiden who had helped him in his\nneed stood before him, and by the silken and shining golden\ngarments which she wore, he knew right well that she was the\nking's daughter.  But the old woman laughed venomously, and said,\nyou think you have her safe, but you have not got her yet.  Just\nas she was about to fall on the maiden and take her away, the\nyouth seized the old woman with both his hands, raised her up\non high, and threw her into the jaws of the fire, which closed\nover her as if it were delighted that an old witch was to be\nburnt.\nThen the king's daughter looked at the drummer, and when she saw\nthat he was a handsome youth and remembered how he had risked\nhis life to deliver her, she gave him her hand, and said, you\nhave ventured everything for my sake, but I also will do everything\nfor yours.  Promise to be true to me, and you shall be my\nhusband.  We shall not want for riches, we shall have enough\nwith what the witch has gathered together here.  She led him into\nthe house, where there were chests and coffers crammed with the\nold woman's treasures.  The maiden left the gold and silver where\nit was, and took only the precious stones.  She would not stay\nany longer on the glass-mountain, so the drummer said to her,\nseat yourself by me on my saddle, and then we will fly down like\nbirds.  I do not like the old saddle, said she, I need only\nturn my wishing-ring and we shall be at home.  Very well, then,\nanswered the drummer, then wish us in front of the town-gate.  In\nthe twinkling of an eye they were there, but the drummer said,\nI will just go to my parents and tell them the news.  Wait for\nme outside here, I shall soon be back.  Ah, said the king's\ndaughter, I beg you to be careful.  On your arrival do not kiss\nyour parents on the right cheek, or else you will forget\neverything, and I shall stay behind here outside, alone and\ndeserted.  How can I forget you, said he, and promised her to\ncome back very soon, and gave his hand upon it.  When he went into\nhis father's house, he had changed so much that no one knew who\nhe was, for the three days which he had passed on the glass-mountain\nhad been three years.  Then he made himself known, and his parents\nfell on his neck with joy, and his heart was so moved that\nhe forgot what the maiden had said and kissed them on both\ncheeks.  But when he had given them the kiss on the right cheek,\nevery thought of the king's daughter vanished from him.  He\nemptied out his pockets, and laid handfuls of the largest jewels\non the table.  The parents had not the least idea what to do with\nthe riches.  Then the father built a magnificent castle all\nsurrounded by gardens, woods, and meadows as if a prince were\ngoing to live in it, and when it was ready, the mother said, I\nhave found a maiden for you and the wedding shall be in three days.\nThe son was content to do as his parents desired.\nThe poor king's daughter had stood for a long time outside the\ntown waiting for the return of the young man.  When evening came,\nshe said, he must certainly have kissed his parents on the right\ncheek, and has forgotten me.  Her heart was full of sorrow, she\nwished herself into a solitary little hut in a forest, and would\nnot return to her father's court.  Every evening she went into\nthe town and passed the young man's house.  He often saw her,\nbut he no longer knew her.  At length she heard the people\nsaying, the wedding will take place to-morrow.  Then she said,\nI will try if I can win back his heart.\nOn the first day of the wedding ceremonies, she turned her\nwishing-ring, and said, a dress as bright as the sun.  Instantly\nthe dress lay before her, and it was as bright as if it had been\nwoven of real sunbeams.  When all the guests were assembled, she\nentered the hall.  Every one was amazed at the beautiful dress,\nand the bride most of all, and as pretty dresses were the\nthings she had most delight in, she went to the stranger and asked\nif she would sell it to her.  Not for money, she answered, but\nif I may pass the first night outside the door of the room where\nyour betrothed sleeps, I will give it up to you.  The bride\ncould not overcome her desire and consented, but she mixed a\nsleeping-draught with the wine her betrothed took at night,\nwhich made him fall into a deep sleep.  When all had be-\n           - line missing in book copy -\nof the bedroom, opened it just a little, and cried,\n          drummer, drummer, I pray you hear.\n          Have you forgotten you held me dear.\n          That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour.\n          That I rescued your life from the witch's power.\n          Did you not plight your troth to me.\n          Drummer, drummer, hearken to me.\nBut it was all in vain, for the drummer did not awake, and when\nmorning dawned, the king's daughter was forced to go back again\nas she came.  On the second evening she turned her wishing-ring\nand said, a dress as silvery as the moon.  When she appeared at\nthe feast in the dress which was as soft as moonbeams, it again\nexcited the desire of the bride, and the king's daughter gave it\nto her\nfor permission to pass the second night also, outside the door\nof the bedroom.  When in the stillness of the night, she cried,\n          drummer, drummer, I pray you hear.\n          Have you forgotten you held me dear.\n          That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour.\n          That I rescued your life from the witch's power.\n          Did you not plight your troth to me.\n          Drummer, drummer, hearken to me.\nBut the drummer, who was stupefied with the sleeping-draught,\ncould not be aroused.  Sadly next morning she went back to\nher hut in the forest.  But the people in the house had heard\nthe lamentation of the unknown maiden, and told the bridegroom\nabout it.  They told him also that it was impossible that he could\nhear anything of it, because the maiden he was going to marry\nhad poured a sleeping-draught into his wine.\nOn the third evening, the king's daughter turned her wishing-ring,\nand said, a dress glittering like the stars.  When she showed\nherself therein at the feast, the bride was quite beside herself\nwith the splendor of the dress, which far surpassed the others,\nand she said, I must, and will have it.  The maiden gave it as\nshe had given the others for permission to spend the night\noutside the bridegroom's door.  The bridegroom, however, did not\ndrink the wine which was handed to him before he went to bed,\nbut poured it behind the bed, and when everything was quiet, he\nheard a sweet voice which called to him,\n          drummer, drummer, I pray you hear.\n          Have you forgotten you held me dear.\n          That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour.\n          That I rescued your life from the witch's power.\n          Did you not plight your troth to me.\n          Drummer, drummer, hearken to me.\nSuddenly his memory returned to him.  Ah, cried he, how can I\nhave acted so unfaithfully.  But the kiss which in the joy of my\nheart I gave my parents, on the right cheek, that is to blame\nfor it all.  That is what stupefied me.  He sprang up, took the\nking's daughter by the hand, and led her to his parents, bed.\nThis is my true bride, said he.  If I marry the other, I shall\ndo a great wrong.  The parents, when they heard how everything\nhad happened, gave their consent.  Then the lights in the\nhall were lighted again, drums and trumpets were brought,\nfriends and relations were invited to come, and the real wedding\nwas solemnized with great rejoicing.  The first bride received\nthe beautiful dresses as a compensation, and declared herself\nsatisfied.\n", "The Ear of Corn": "In former times, when God himself still walked the earth, the\nfruitfulness of the soil was much greater than it is now.  Then\nthe ears of corn did not bear fifty or sixty, but four or five\nhundred-fold.  Then the corn grew from the bottom to the very top\nof the stalk, and according to the length of the stalk was the\nlength of the ear.  Men however are so made, that when they are\ntoo well off they no longer value the blessings which come from\nGod, but grow indifferent and careless.  One day a woman was\npassing by a corn-field when her little child, who was running\nbeside her, fell into a puddle, and dirtied her frock.  On this\nthe mother tore up a handful of the beautiful ears of corn, and\ncleaned the frock with them.\nWhen the Lord, who just then came by, saw that, he was angry,\nand said, henceforth shall the stalks of corn bear no more ears,\nmen are no longer worthy of heavenly gifts.  The by-standers who\nheard this, were terrified, and fell on their knees and prayed\nthat he would still leave something on the stalks, even if the\npeople were undeserving of it, for the sake of the innocent\nchickens which would otherwise have to starve.  The Lord, who\nforesaw their suffering, had pity on them, and granted the\nrequest.  So the ears were left as they now grow.\n", "Old Rinkrank": "There was once upon a time a king who had a daughter,\nand he caused a glass mountain to be made, and said that\nwhosoever could cross to the other side of it without falling\nshould have his daughter to wife.  Then there was one who loved\nthe king's daughter, and he asked the king if he might have her.\nYes, said the king, if you can cross the mountain without falling,\nyou shall have her.  And the princess said she would go over it\nwith him, and would hold him if he were about to fall.  So they\nset out together to go over it, and when they were half way up the\nprincess slipped and fell, and the glass mountain opened and shut\nher up inside it, and her betrothed could not see where she had\ngone, for the mountain closed immediately.  Then he wept and\nlamented much, and the king was miserable too, and ordered the\nmountain to be broken open where she had been lost, and thought\nhe would\nbe able to get her out again, but they could not find the place\ninto which she had fallen.\nMeanwhile the king's daughter had fallen quite deep down into\nthe earth into a great cave.  An old fellow with a very long gray\nbeard came to meet her, and told her that if she would be his\nservant and do everything he bade her, she might live, if not\nhe would kill her.  So she did all he bade her.  In the mornings\nhe took his ladder out of his pocket, and set it up against the\nmountain and climbed to the top by its help, and then he drew the\nladder after him.  The princess had to cook his dinner, make his\nbed, and do all his work, and when he came home again he always\nbrought with him a heap of gold and silver.  When she had lived\nwith him for many years, and had grown quite old, he called her\nmother mansrot, and she had to call him old rinkrank.  Then once\nwhen he was out, and she had made his bed and washed his dishes,\nshe shut the doors and windows all fast, and there was one little\nwindow through which the light shone in, and this she left open.\nWhen old rinkrank came home, he knocked at his door, and cried,\nmother mansrot, open the door for me.  No, said she, old rinkrank,\nI will not open the door for you.  Then he said,\n     here stand I, poor rinkrank,\n     on my seventeen long shanks,\n     on my weary, worn-out foot,\n     wash my dishes, mother mansrot.\nI have washed your dishes already, said she.  Then again he said,\n     here stand I, poor rinkrank,\n     on my seventeen long shanks,\n     on my weary, worn-out foot,\n     make my bed, mother mansrot.\nI have made your bed already, said she.  Then again he said,\n     here stand I, poor rinkrank,\n     on my seventeen long shanks,\n     on my weary, worn-out foot,\n     open the door, mother mansrot.\nThen he ran all round his house, and saw that the little window\nwas open, and thought, I will look in and see what she can be about,\nand why she will not open the door for me.  He tried to peep in,\nbut could not get his head through because of his long beard.\nSo he first put his beard through the open window, but just as he\nhad got it through, mother mansrot came by and pulled the window\ndown with a cord which she had tied to it, and his beard was shut\nfast in it.  Then he began to cry most piteously, for it hurt\nhim very much, and to entreat her to release him again.  But she\nsaid not until he gave her the ladder with which he ascended the\nmountain.  Then, whether he would or not, he had to tell her where\nthe ladder was.  And she fastened a very long ribbon to the\nwindow, and then she set up the ladder, and ascended the\nmountain, and when she was at the top of it she opened the\nwindow.  She went to her father, and told him all that had\nhappened to her.  The king rejoiced greatly, and her betrothed\nwas still there, and they went and dug up the mountain, and found\nold rinkrank inside it with all his gold and silver.  Then the\nking had old rinkrank put to death, and took all his gold and\nsilver.  The princess married her betrothed, and lived right\nhappily in great magnificence and joy.\n", "The Crystal Ball": "There was once an enchantress, who had three sons who loved each\nother as brothers, but the old woman did not trust them, and\nthought they wanted to steal her power from her.  So she changed\nthe eldest into an eagle, which was forced to dwell in the rocky\nmountains, and was often seen flying in great circles in the sky.\nThe second, she changed into a whale, which lived in the deep sea,\nand all that was seen of it was that it sometimes spouted up a\ngreat jet of water in the air.  Each of them bore his\nhuman form for only two hours daily.  The third son, who was afraid\nshe might change him into a raging wild beast - a bear perhaps, or\na wolf, went secretly away.  He had heard that a king's daughter\nwho was bewitched, was imprisoned in the castle of the golden sun,\nand was waiting to be set free.  Those, however, who tried to free\nher risked their lives.  Three-and-twenty youths had already died\na miserable death, and now only one other might make the attempt,\nafter which no more must come.  And as his heart was without fear,\nhe made up his mind to seek out the castle of the golden sun.  He\nhad already traveled about for a long time without being able to\nfind it, when he came by chance into a great forest, and did not\nknow the way out of it.  All at once he saw in the distance two\ngiants, who made a sign to him with their hands, and when he came\nto them they said, we are quarreling about a cap, and which of us\nit is to belong to, and as we are equally strong, neither of us\ncan get the better of the other.  The small men are cleverer than\nwe are, so we will leave the decision to you.  How can you\ndispute about an old cap, said the youth.  You do not know what\nproperties it has.  It is a wishing-cap, whosoever puts it on, can\nwish himself away wherever he likes, and in an instant he will be\nthere.  Give me the cap, said the youth, I will go a short\ndistance off, and when I call you, you must run a race, and the\ncap shall belong to the one who gets first to me.  He put it on\nand went away, and thought of the king's daughter, forgot the\ngiants, and walked continually onward.  At length he sighed from\nthe very bottom of his heart, and cried, ah, if I were but at the\ncastle of the golden sun.  And hardly had the words passed his\nlips than he was standing on a high mountain before the\ngate of the castle.\nHe entered and went through all the rooms, until in the last he\nfound the king's daughter.  But how shocked he was when he saw\nher.  She had an ashen-gray face full of wrinkles, bleary eyes,\nand red hair.  Are you the king's daughter, whose beauty the whole\nworld praises, cried he.  Ah, she answered, this is not my form,\nhuman eyes can only see me in this state of ugliness, but that you\nmay know what I am like, look in the mirror - it does not let\nitself be misled - it will show you my image as it is in truth.\nShe gave him the mirror in his hand, and he saw therein the\nlikeness of the most beautiful maiden on earth, and saw, too, how\nthe tears were rolling down her cheeks with grief.  Then said he,\nhow can you be set free.  I fear no danger.  She said, he who gets\nthe crystal ball, and holds it before the enchanter, will destroy\nhis power with it, and I shall resume my true shape.  Ah, she\nadded, so many have already gone to meet death for this, and you\nare so young, I grieve that you should encounter such great\ndanger.  Nothing can keep me from doing it, said he, but tell me\nwhat I must do.  You shall know everything, said the king's\ndaughter, when you descend the mountain on which the castle stands,\na wild bull will stand below by a spring, and you must fight with\nit, and if you have the luck to kill it, a fiery bird will spring\nout of it, which bears in its body a red-hot egg, and in the egg\nthe crystal ball lies as its yolk.  The bird, however, will not\nlet the egg fall until forced to do so, and if it falls on the\nground, it will flame up and burn everything that is near, and\neven the egg itself will melt, and with it the crystal ball,\nand then your trouble will have been in vain.\nThe youth went down to the spring, where the bull snorted and\nbellowed at him.  After a long struggle he plunged his sword in the\nanimal's body, and it fell down.  Instantly a fiery bird arose\nfrom it and was about to fly away, but the young man's brother,\nthe eagle, who was passing between the clouds, swooped down,\nhunted it away to the sea, and struck it with his beak until, in\nits extremity, it let the egg fall.  The egg, however, did not\nfall into the sea, but on a fisherman's hut which stood on the\nshore and the hut began at once to smoke and was about to break\nout in flames.  Then arose in the sea waves as high as a house,\nwhich streamed over the hut, and subdued the fire.  The other\nbrother, the whale, had come swimming to them, and had driven the\nwater up on high.  When the fire was extinguished, the youth\nsought for the egg and happily found it, it was not yet melted,\nbut the shell was broken by being so suddenly cooled with the\nwater, and he could take out the crystal ball unhurt.\nWhen the youth went to the enchanter and held it before him,\nthe latter said, my power is destroyed, and from this time forth\nyou are the king of the castle of the golden sun.  With this you\ncan likewise give back to your brothers their human form.\nThen the youth hastened to the king's daughter, and when he\nentered the room, she was standing there in the full splendor\nof her beauty, and joyfully they exchanged rings with each other.\n", "Maid Maleen": "There was once a king who had a son who asked in marriage the\ndaughter of a mighty king, she was called maid maleen, and was\nvery beautiful.  As her father wished to give her to another,\nthe prince was rejected, but as they both loved each other with\nall their hearts, they would not give each other up, and\nmaid maleen said to her father, I can and will take no other for\nmy husband.  Then the king flew into a passion, and ordered a\ndark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight\nshould enter.  When it was finished, he said, therein shall you be\nimprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if your\nperverse spirit is broken.  Meat and drink for the seven years\nwere carried into the tower, and then she and her maid-in-waiting\nwere led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and\nfrom the earth.  There they sat in the darkness, and knew not\nwhen day or night began.  The king's son often went round and\nround the tower, and called their names, but no sound from\nwithout pierced through the thick walls.  What else could they do\nbut lament and complain.\nMeanwhile the time passed, and by the decline of food and drink\nthey knew that the seven years were coming to an end.  They\nthought the moment of their deliverance was come, but no stroke\nof the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it\nseemed to maid maleen that her father had forgotten her.  As\nthey had food only for a short time longer, and saw a miserable\ndeath awaiting them, maid maleen said, we must try our last\nchance, and see if we can break through the wall.  She took the\nbread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and\nwhen she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn.  With great\nlabor they succeeded in getting out one stone, and then a second,\nand a third, and when three days were over the first ray of light\nfell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that\nthey could look out.  The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze\nplayed on their faces, but how melancholy everything looked all\naround.  Her father's castle lay in ruins, the town and the\nvillages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the\nfields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible.\nWhen the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip\nthrough, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then maid maleen\nfollowed.  But where were they to go.  The enemy had ravaged the\nwhole kingdom, driven away the king, and slain all the inhabitants.\nThey wandered forth to seek another\ncountry, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to\ngive them a mouthful of bread, and their need was so great that\nthey were forced to appease their hunger with nettles.  When,\nafter long journeying, they came into another country, they tried\nto get work everywhere, but wherever they knocked they were turned\naway, and no one would have pity on them.  At last they arrived in\na large city and went to the royal palace.  There also they were\nordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay\nin the kitchen and be scullions.\nThe son of the king in whose kingdom they were, however, was the\nvery man who had been betrothed to maid maleen.  His father had\nchosen another bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart\nwas wicked.  The wedding was fixed, and the maiden had already\narrived, but because of her great ugliness she shut herself in\nher room, and allowed no one to see her, and maid maleen had to\ntake her her meals from the kitchen.  When the day came for the\nbride and the bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her\nugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets,\nshe would be mocked and laughed at by the people.  Then said she\nto maid maleen, a great piece of luck has befallen you.  I have\nsprained my foot, and cannot well walk through the streets, you\nshall put on wedding-clothes and take my place, a greater honor\nthan that you cannot have.  Maid maleen, however, refused it, and\nsaid, I wish for no honor which is not suitable for me.  It was in\nvain, too, that the bride offered her gold.  At last she said\nangrily, if you do not obey me, it shall cost you your life.  I\nhave but to speak the word, and your head will lie at your feet.\nThen she was forced to obey, and put on the bride's magnificent\nclothes and all her jewels.  When she entered the royal hall, every\none was amazed at her great beauty, and the king said to his son,\nthis is the bride whom I have chosen for you, and whom you must\nlead to church.  The bridegroom was astonished, and thought, she\nis like my maid maleen, and I should believe that it was she\nherself, but she has long been shut up in the tower, or dead.\nHe took her by the hand and led her to church.  On the way was a\nnettle-plant, and she said,\n     oh, nettle-plant,\n     little nettle-plant,\n     what dost thou here alone.\n     I have known the time\n     when I ate thee unboiled\n     when I ate thee unroasted.\nWhat are you saying, asked the king's son.  Nothing, she replied,\nI was only thinking of maid maleen.  He was surprised that she knew\nabout her, but kept silence.  When they came to the foot-plank\ninto the chuchyard, she said,\n     foot-bridge, do not break,\n     I am not the true bride.\nWhat are you saying there, asked the the king's son.  Nothing, she\nreplied, I was only thinking of maid maleen.  Do you know maid\nmaleen.  No, she answered, how should I know her, I have only\nheard of her.  When they came to the church-door, she said once\nmore,\n     church-door, break not,\n     I am not the true bride.\nWhat are you saying there asked he.  Ah, she answered, I was only\nthinking of maid maleen.  Then he took out a precious chain, put it\nround her neck, and fastened the clasp.  Thereupon they entered the\nchurch, and the priest joined their hands together before the\naltar, and married them.  He led her home, but she did not speak\na single word the whole way.  When they got back to the royal\npalace, she hurried into the bride's chamber, put off the\nmagnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed herself in her gray\ngown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck, which she had\nreceived from the bridegroom.\nWhen the night came, and the bride was to be led into the prince's\napartment, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not\nobserve the deception.  As soon as everyone had gone away, he said\nto her,  what did you say to the nettle-plant which was growing\nby the wayside.\nTo which nettle-plant, asked she, I don't talk to nettle-plants.\nIf you did not do it, then you are not the true bride, said he.\nSo she bethought herself, and said,\n     I must go out unto my maid\n     who keeps my thoughts for me.\nShe went out and sought maid maleen.  Girl, what have you been\nsaying to the nettle.  I said nothing but,\n     oh, nettle-plant,\n     little nettle-plant,\n     what dost thou here alone.\n     I have known the time\n     when I ate thee unboiled,\n     when I ate thee unroasted.\nThe bride ran back into the chamber, and said, I know now\nwhat I said to the nettle, and she repeated the words which she had\njust heard.  But what did you say to the foot-bridge when we went\nover it asked the king's son.  To the foot-bridge, she answered.\nI don't talk to foot-bridges.  Then you are not the true bride.\nShe again said,\n     I must go out unto my maid,\n     who keeps my thoughts for me.\nAnd ran out and scolded maid maleen, girl, what did you say to the\nfoot-bridge.\nI said nothing but,\n     foot-bridge, do not break,\n     I am not the true bride.\nThat costs you your life, cried the bride, but she hurried into\nthe room and said, I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,\nand she repeated the words.  But what did you say to the\nchurch-door.  To the church-door, she replied, I don't talk to\nchurch-doors.  Then you are not the true bride.\nShe went out and scolded maid maleen, and said, girl, what did you\nsay to the church-door.  I said nothing but,\n     church-door, break not,\n     I am not the true bride.\nThat will break your neck for you, cried the bride, and flew\ninto a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and\nsaid, I know now what I said to the church-door, and she\nrepeated the words.  But where have you the jewel which I gave you\nat the church-door.  What jewel, she answered, you did not give\nme any jewel.  I myself put it round your neck, and I myself\nfastened it, if you do not know that, you are not the true bride.\nHe drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her immeasurable\nugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, how do you come here.\nWho are you.  I am your betrothed bride, but because I feared lest\nthe people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I\ncommanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to\ngo to church instead of me.  Where is the girl, said he\nI want to see her, go and bring her here.  She went out\nand told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and\nthat they must take her out into the court-yard and strike off her\nhead.  The servants laid hold of maid maleen and wanted to drag her\nout, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the king's son\nheard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to\nset the maiden free instantly.  Lights were brought, and then he\nsaw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the\nchurch-door.  You are the true bride, said he, who went with me\nto church, come with me now to my room.  When they were both alone,\nhe said, on the way to the church you did name maid maleen, who\nwas my betrothed bride.  If I could believe it possible, I should\nthink she was standing before me - you are like her in every\nrespect.  She answered, I am maid maleen, who for your sake was\nimprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and\nthirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty.  Today,\nhowever, the sun is shining on me once more.  I was married to\nyou in the church, and I am your lawful wife.  Then they kissed\neach other, and were happy all the days of their lives.  The\nfalse bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her\nhead cut off.\nThe tower in which maid maleen had been imprisoned remained\nstanding for a long time, and when the children passed by it\nthey sang,\n     king, klang, gloria.\n     Who sits within this tower.\n     A king's daughter, she sits within,\n     a sight of her I cannot win,\n     the wall it will not break,\n     the stone cannot be pierced.\n     Little Hans, with your coat so gay,\n     follow me, follow me, fast as you may.\n", "St. Joseph in the Forest": "There was once on a time a mother who had three daughters,\nthe eldest of whom was rude and wicked, the second much better,\nalthough she had her faults, but the youngest was a pious, good\nchild.  The mother, however, was so strange, that it was just\nthe eldest daughter whom she most loved, and she could not bear\nthe youngest.  On this account, she often sent the poor girl\nout into the great forest in order to get rid of her, for she\nthought she would lose herself and never come back again.  But\nthe guardian-angel which every good child has, did not forsake\nher, but always brought her into the right path again.  Once,\nhowever, the guardian-angel behaved as if he were not there,\nand the child could not find her way out of the forest again.\nShe walked on constantly until evening came, and then she saw\na tiny light burning in the distance, ran up to it at once,\nand came to a little hut.  She knocked, the door opened, and\nshe came to a second door, where she knocked again.  An old man,\nwho had a snow-white beard and looked venerable, opened it\nfor her.  And he was no other than St. Joseph.  He said quite\nkindly, come, dear child, seat yourself on my little chair by\nthe fire, and warm yourself.  I will fetch you clear water if\nyou are thirsty.  But here in the forest, I have nothing for\nyou to eat but a couple of little roots, which you must first\nscrape and boil.\nSt. Joseph gave her the roots.  The girl scraped them clean, then\nshe brought a piece of pancake and the bread that her mother\nhad given her to take with her, mixed all together in a pan, and\ncooked herself a thick soup.  When it was ready, St. Joseph said,\nI am so hungry, give me some of your food.  The child was quite\nwilling, and gave him more than she kept for herself, but God's\nblessing\nwas with her, so that she was satisfied.  When they had eaten,\nSt. Joseph said, now we will go to bed.  I have, however, only\none bed, lay your self in it.  I will lie on the ground on the\nstraw.  No, answered she, stay in your own bed, the straw is\nsoft enough for me.  But St. Joseph took the child in his arms,\nand carried her into the little bed, and there she said her\nprayers, and fell asleep.  Next morning when she awoke, she\nwanted to say good morning to St. Joseph, but she did not see him.\nThen she got up and looked for him, but could not find him\nanywhere.  At last she perceived, behind the door, a bag with\nmoney so heavy that she could just carry it, and on it was\nwritten that it was for the child who had slept there that night.\nOn this she took the bag, bounded away with it, and got\nsafely to her mother, and as she gave her mother all the money,\nshe could not help being satisfied with her.\nThe next day, the second child also took a fancy to go into\nthe forest.  Her mother gave her a much larger piece of pancake\nand bread.  It happened with her just as with the first child.\nIn the evening she came to St. Joseph's little hut, who gave her\nroots for a thick soup.  When it was ready, he likewise said\nto her, I am so hungry, give me some of your food.  Then the\nchild said, you may have your share.  Afterwards, when St.\nJoseph offered her his bed and wanted to lie on the straw, she\nreplied, no, lie down in the bed, there is plenty of room for\nboth of us.  St. Joseph took her in his arms and put her in the\nbed, and laid himself on the straw.\nIn the morning when the child awoke and looked for St. Joseph,\nhe had vanished, but behind the door she found a little sack\nof money that was about as long as a hand, and on it was\nwritten that it was for the child who had slept there last\nnight.  So she took the little bag and ran home with it, and\ntook it to her mother, but she secretly kept two pieces for\nherself.\nThe eldest daughter had by this time grown inquisitive, and the\nnext morning also insisted on going out into the forest.  Her\nmother gave her pancakes - as many as she wanted, and bread\nand cheese as well.  In the evening she found St. Joseph in his\nlittle hut, just as the two others had found him.  When the\nsoup was ready\nand St. Joseph said, I am so hungry, give me some of the food,\nthe girl answered, wait until I am satisfied, then if there is\nanything left you shall have it.  But she ate nearly the\nwhole of it, and St. Joseph had to scrape the dish.  Afterwards,\nthe good old man offered her his bed, and wanted to lie on\nthe straw.  She took it without making any opposition, laid\nherself down in the little bed, and left the hard straw to the\nwhite-haired man.  Next morning when she awoke, St. Joseph was\nnot to be found, but she did not trouble herself about that.  She\nlooked behind the door for a money-bag.  She fancied something\nwas lying on the ground, but as she could not very well distinguish\nwhat it was, she stooped down, so that she touched it with her\nnose, where it remained hanging, and when she got up again,\nshe saw, to her horror, that it was a second nose, which was\nhanging fast to her own.  Then she began to scream and howl,\nbut that did no good.  She always had to look at her nose, for\nit stretched out so far.  Then she ran out and screamed without\nstopping till she met St. Joseph, at whose feet she fell and begged\nuntil, out of pity, he took the nose off her again, and even\ngave her two farthings.  When she got home, her mother was standing\nbefore the door, and asked, what have you had given to you.  Then\nshe\nlied and said, a great bag of money, but I have lost it on the way.\nLost it. Cried the mother.  Oh, but we will soon find it again,\nand took her by the hand, and wanted to seek it with her.  At\nfirst she began to cry, and did not wish to go, but at last she\nwent.  On the way, however, so many lizards and snakes broke\nloose on both of them, that they did not know how to save\nthemselves.  At last they stung the wicked child to death, and\nthey stung the mother in the foot, because she had not brought\nher up better.\n", "The Twelve Apostles": "Three hundred years before the birth of the Lord christ, there\nlived a mother who had twelve sons, but was so poor and needy\nthat she no longer knew how she was to keep them alive.  She\nprayed to God daily that he would grant that all her sons might\nbe on the earth with the redeemer who was promised.  When her\nnecessity became still greater she sent one of them after the\nother out into the world to seek their bread.  The eldest was\ncalled peter, and he went out and had already walked a long\nway, a whole day's journey, when he came into a great forest.\nHe sought for a way out, but could find none, and went farther\nand farther astray, and at the same time felt such great hunger\nthat he could scarcely stand.  At length he became so weak that\nhe was forced to lie down, and he believed death to be at\nhand.  Suddenly there stood beside him a small boy who shone\nwith brightness, and was as beautiful and kind as an angel.\nThe child smote his little hands together, until peter was\nforced to look up and see him.  Then the child said, why are\nyou sitting there in such trouble.  Alas. Answered peter, I\nam going about the world seeking bread, that I may yet see the\ndear savior who is promised, that is my greatest desire.  The\nchild said, come with me, and your wish shall be fulfilled.  He\ntook poor peter by the hand, and led him between some cliffs to a\ngreat cavern.  When they entered it, everything was shining\nwith gold, silver, and crystal, and in the midst of it twelve\ncradles were standing side by side.  Then said the little angel,\nlie down in the first, and sleep a while, I will rock you.\nPeter did so, and the angel sang to him and rocked him until\nhe was alseep. And when he was asleep, the second brother came\nalso, guided thither by his guardian angel, and he was rocked\nto sleep like the first, and thus came the others, one after\nthe other, until all twelve lay there sleeping in the golden\ncradles.  They slept, however, three hundred years, until the\nnight when the savior of the world was born.  Then they awoke,\nand were with him on earth, and were called the twelve apostles.\n", "The Rose": "There was once a poor woman who had two children.  The youngest\nhad to go every day into the forest to fetch wood.  Once when\nshe had gone a long way to seek it, a little child, who\nwas quite strong, came and helped her industriously to pick up\nthe wood and carry it home, and then before a moment had passed\nthe strange child disappeared.  The child told her mother this,\nbut at first she would not believe it.  At length she brought\na rose home, and told her mother that the beautiful child had\ngiven her this\nrose, and had told her that when it was in full bloom, he would\nreturn.  The mother put the rose in water.  One morning her\nchild could not get out of bed.  The mother went to the bed and\nfound her dead, but she lay looking very happy.  On the same\nmorning, the rose was in full bloom.\n", "Poverty and Humility Lead to Heaven": "There was once a king's son who went out into the world, and\nhe was full of thought and sad.  He looked at the sky, which\nwas so beautifully pure and blue, then he sighed, and said,\nhow well must all be with one up there in heaven.\nThen he saw a poor gray-haired man who was coming along the\nroad towards him, and he spoke to him, and asked, how can I\nget to heaven.  The man answered, by poverty and humility.  Put\non my ragged clothes, wander about the world for seven years,\nand get to know what misery is, take no money, but if you are hungry\nask compassionate hearts for a bit of bread.  In this way you will\nreach heaven.\nThen the king's son took off his magnificent coat, and wore in\nits place the beggar's garment, went out into the wide world,\nand suffered great misery.  He took nothing but a little food,\nsaid nothing, but prayed to the Lord to take him into his\nheaven.  When the\nseven years were over, he returned to his father's palace, but no\none recognized him.  He said to the servants, go and tell my\nparents that I have come back again.  But the servants did not\nbelieve it, and laughed and left him standing there.  Then said he,\ngo and tell it to my brothers that they may come down, for I\nshould so like to see them again.  The servants would not do that\neither, but at last one of them went, and told it to the king's\nchildren, but these did not believe it, and did not trouble\nthemselves about it.  Then he wrote a letter to his mother, and\ndescribed to her all his misery, but he did not say that he was\nher son.  So out of pity, the queen had a place under the stairs\nassigned to him, and food taken to him daily by two servants.  But\none of them was ill-natured and said, why should the beggar have\nthe good food, and kept it for himself, or gave it to the\ndogs, and took the weak, emaciated beggar nothing but water.  The\nother, however, was honest, and took the beggar what was sent to\nhim.  It was little, but he could live on it for a while, and\nall the time he was quite patient, but he grew continually weaker.\nAs his illness increased, he desired to receive the last sacrament.\nWhen the mass was being celebrated, all the bells in the town and\nneighborhood began to ring of their own accord.  After mass the\npriest went to the poor man under the stairs, and there he lay\ndead.  In one hand he had a rose, in the other a lily, and beside\nhim was a paper on which was written his history.\nWhen he was buried, a rose grew on one side of his grave, and a\nlily on the other.\n", "God's Food": "There were once upon a time two sisters, one of whom had no\nchildren and was rich, and the other had five and was a\nwidow, and so poor that she no longer had food enough to satisfy\nherself and her children.  In her need, therefore, she went to\nher sister, and said, my children and I are suffering the greatest\nhunger.  You are rich, give me a mouthful of bread.  The very\nrich sister was as hard as a stone, and said, I myself have nothing\nin the house, and drove away the poor creature with harsh words.\nAfter some time the husband of the rich sister came home, and was\njust going to cut himself a piece of bread, but when he made the\nfirst cut into the loaf, out flowed red blood.  When the woman\nsaw that she was terrified and told him what had occurred.  He\nhurried away to help the widow and her children, but when he\nentered her room, he found her praying.  She had her two youngest\nchildren in her arms, and the three eldest were lying dead.  He\noffered her food, but she answered, for earthly food have we no\nlonger any desire.  God has already satisfied the hunger of three\nof us, and he will hearken to our supplications likewise.\nScarcely had she uttered these words than the two little ones\ndrew their last breath, whereupon her heart broke, and she sank\ndown dead.\n", "The Three Green Twigs": "There was once upon a time a hermit who lived in a forest at the\nfoot of a mountain, and passed his time in prayer and good works,\nand every evening he carried, to the glory of God, two pails of\nwater up the mountain.  Many a beast drank of it, and many a plant\nwas refreshed by it, for on the heights above, a strong wind blew\ncontinually, which dried the air and the ground, and the wild\nbirds which dread mankind wheel about there, and with their sharp\neyes search for a drink.  And because the hermit was so pious, an\nangel of God, visible to his eyes, went up with him, counted his\nsteps, and when the work was completed, brought him his food, even\nas the prophet of old was by God's command fed by the raven.  When\nthe hermit in his piety had already reached a great age, it\nhappened that he once saw from afar a poor sinner being taken to\nthe gallows.  He said carelessly to himself, there, that one is\ngetting his deserts.  In the evening, when he was carrying the\nwater up the mountain, the angel who usually accompanied him did\nnot appear, and also brought him no food.  Then he was terrified,\nand searched his heart, and tried to think how he could have\nsinned, as God was so angry, but he did not discover it.  Then\nhe neither ate nor drank, threw himself down on the ground, and\nprayed day and night.  And as he was one day thus bitterly\nweeping in the forest, he heard a little bird singing beautifully\nand delightfully, and then he was still more troubled and said,\nhow joyously you sing, the Lord is not angry with you.  Ah, if\nyou could but tell me how I can have offended him, that I might\ndo penance, and then my heart also would be glad again.  Then the\nbird began to speak and said, you have done injustice, in that\nyou have condemned a poor sinner who was being led to the gallows,\nand for that the Lord is angry with you.  He alone sits in\njudgement.  However, if you will do penance and repent your sins,\nhe will forgive you.  Then the angel stood beside him with a dry\nbranch in his hand and said, you shall carry this dry branch until\nthree green twigs sprout out of it, but at night when you will\nsleep, you shall lay it under your head.  You shall beg your\nbread from door to door, and not tarry more than one night in the\nsame house.  That is the penance which the Lord lays on you.\nThen the hermit took the piece of wood, and went back into the\nworld, which he had not seen for so long.  He ate and drank\nnothing but what was given him at the doors.  Many petitions,\nhowever, were not listened to, and many doors remained shut to\nhim, so that he often did not get a crumb of bread.\nOnce when he had gone from door to door from morning till night,\nand no one had given him anything, and no one would shelter him\nfor the night, he went forth into a forest, and at last found a\ncave which someone had made, and an old woman was sitting in it.\nThen said he, good woman, keep me with you in your house for\nthis night.  But she said, no, I dare not, even if I wished,\nI have three sons who are wicked and wild, if they come home\nfrom their robbing expedition, and find you, they would kill us\nboth.  The hermit said, let me stay, they will do no injury\neither to you or to me.  And the old woman was compassionate,\nand let herself be persuaded.  Then the man lay down beneath the\nstairs, and put the bit of wood under his head.  When the old\nwoman saw him do that, she asked the reason of it, on which he\ntold her that he carried the bit of wood about with him for a\npenance, and used it at night for a pillow, and that he had\noffended the Lord, because, when he had seen a poor sinner on\nthe way to the gallows, he had said he was getting his deserts.\nThen the woman began to weep and cried, if the Lord punishes one\nsingle word, how will it fare with my sons when they appear\nbefore him in judgment.\nAt midnight the robbers came home and blustered and stormed.\nThey made a fire, and when it had lighted up the cave and they\nsaw a man lying under the stairs, they fell in a rage and cried to\ntheir mother, who is the man.  Have we not forbidden anyone\nwhomsoever to be taken in.  Then said the mother, let him alone,\nit is a poor sinner who is expiating his crime.  The robbers\nasked, what has he done.  Old man, cried they, tell us your sins.\nThe old man raised himself and told them how he, by one single\nword, had so sinned that God was angry with him, and how he was\nnow expiating this crime.  The robbers were so powerfully touched\nin their hearts by this story, that they were shocked with their\nlife up to this time, reflected, and began with hearty\nrepentance to do penance for it.  The hermit, after he had\nconverted the three sinners, lay down to sleep again under the\nstairs.  In the morning, however, they found him dead, and out of\nthe dry wood on which his head lay, three green twigs had grown\nup on high.  Thus the Lord had once more received him into his\nfavor.\n", "The Aged Mother": "In a large town there was an old woman who sat in the evening alone\nin her room thinking how she had lost first her husband, then\nboth her children, then one by one all her relatives, and at\nlength, that very day, her last friend, and now she was quite\nalone and desolate.  She was very sad at heart, and heaviest of\nall her losses to her was that of her sons, and in her pain she\nblamed God for it.  She was still sitting lost in thought, when\nall at once she heard the bells ringing for early prayer.  She was\nsurprised that she had thus in her sorrow watched through the\nwhole night, and lighted her lantern and went to church.  It was\nalready lighted up when she arrived, but not as it usually was\nwith wax candles, but with a dim\nlight.  It was also crowded already with people, and all the\nseats were filled, and when the old woman got to her usual place\nit also was not empty, but the whole bench was entirely full.  And\nwhen she looked at the people, they were none other than her dead\nrelatives who were sitting there in their old-fashioned garments,\nbut with pale faces.  They neither spoke nor sang, but a soft\nhumming and whispering was heard all over the church.  Then an\naunt of hers stood up, stepped forward, and said to the poor old\nwoman, look there beside the altar, and you will see your sons.\nThe old woman looked there, and saw her two children, one hanging\non the gallows, the other bound to the wheel.  Then said the aunt,\nbehold, so would it have been with them if they had lived, and if\nthe good God had not taken them to himself when they were\ninnocent children.  The old woman went trembling home, and on her\nknees thanked God for having dealt with her more kindly than she\nhad been able to understand, and on the third day she lay down\nand died.\n", "The Hazel-Branch": "One afternoon the christ-child had laid himself in his cradle-bed\nand had fallen asleep.  Then his mother came to him, looked at him\nfull of gladness, and said, have you laid yourself down to sleep,\nmy child.  Sleep sweetly, and in the meantime, I will go into the\nwood, and fetch you a handful of strawberries, for I know that you\nwill be pleased with them when you awake.  In the wood outside,\nshe found a spot with the most beautiful strawberries, but as she\nwas stooping to gather one, an adder sprang up out of the grass.\nShe was alarmed, left the strawberries where they were, and\nhastened away.  The adder darted after her, but our lady, as you\ncan readily understand, knew what it was best to do.  She hid\nherself behind a hazel-bush, and stood there until the adder had\ncrept away again.  Then she gathered the strawberries, and as she\nset out on her way home she said, as the hazel-bush has been my\nprotection this time, it shall in future protect others also.\nTherefore, from the most remote times, a green hazel-branch has\nbeen the safest protection against adders, snakes, and everything\nelse which creeps on the earth.\n", "The Wonderful Musician": "There was once a wonderful musician, who went quite forlorn\nthrough a forest and thought of all manner of things, and when\nnothing was left for him to think about, he said to himself,\ntime is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest,\nI will fetch hither a good companion for myself.  Then he took his\nfiddle from his back, and played so that it echoed through the\ntrees.  It was not long before a wolf came trotting through the\nthicket towards him.  Ah, here is a wolf coming.  I have no desire\nfor him, said the musician but the wolf came nearer and said to\nhim, ah, dear musician, how beautifully you play.  I should like to\nlearn that, too.  It is soon learnt, the musician replied, you\nhave only to do all that I bid you.  Oh, musician, said the wolf,\nI will obey you as a scholar obeys his master.  The musician bade\nhim follow, and when they had gone part of the way together, they\ncame to an old oak-tree which was hollow inside, and cleft in the\nmiddle.  Look, said the musician, if you will learn to fiddle, put\nyour fore paws into this crevice.  The wolf obeyed, but the\nmusician quickly picked up a stone and with one blow wedged his\ntwo paws so fast that he was forced to stay there like a prisoner.\nWait there until I come back again, said the musician, and went\nhis way.\nAfter a while he again said to himself, time is beginning to pass\nheavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither another\ncompanion, and took his fiddle and again played in the forest.  It\nwas not long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards\nhim.  Ah, there's a fox coming, said the musician.  I have no\ndesire for him.  The fox came up to him and said, oh, dear\nmusician, how beautifully you play.  I should like to learn that\ntoo.  That is soon learnt, said the musician.  You have only to\ndo everything that I bid you.  Oh, musician, then said the fox, I\nwill obey you as a scholar obeys his master.  Follow me, said the\nmusician, and when they had walked a part of the way, they came to\na footpath, with high bushes on both sides of it.  There the\nmusician stood still, and from one side bent a young hazel-bush\ndown to the ground, and put his foot on the end of it.  Then he\nbent down a young tree from the other side as well, and said, now\nlittle fox, if you will learn something, give me your left front\npaw.  The fox obeyed, and the musician fastened his paw to the\nleft bough.  Little fox, said he, now reach me your right paw.\nAnd he tied it to the right bough.  When he had examined whether\nthe knots were firm enough, he let go, and the bushes sprang up\nagain, and jerked up the little fox, so that it hung struggling\nin the air.  Wait there till I come back again, said the musician,\nand went on his way.\nAgain he said to himself, time is beginning to pass heavily with\nme here in the forest, I will fetch hither another companion.\nSo he took his fiddle, and the sound echoed through the forest.\nThen a little hare came springing towards him.  Ah, a hare is\ncoming, said the musician, I do not want him.  Ah, dear\nmusician, said the hare, how beautifully you fiddle, I too,\nshould like to learn that.  That is soon learnt, said the\nmusician, you have only to do everything that I bid you.\nOh, musician, replied the little hare, I will obey you as a\nscholar obeys his master.  They went a part of the way together\nuntil they came to an open space in the forest, where stood an\naspen tree.  The musician tied a long string round the little\nhare's neck,\nthe other end of which he fastened to the tree.  Now briskly,\nlittle hare, run twenty times round the tree, cried the musician,\nand the little hare obeyed, and when it had run round twenty times,\nit had twisted the string twenty times round the trunk of the tree,\nand the little hare was caught, and let it pull and tug as it\nliked, it only made the string cut into its tender neck.  Wait\nthere till I come back, said the musician, and went onwards.\nThe wolf, in the meantime, had pushed and pulled and bitten at\nthe stone, and had worked so long that he had set his feet at\nliberty and had drawn them once more out of the cleft.  Full of\nanger and rage he hurried after the musician and wanted to tear\nhim to pieces.  When the fox saw him running, he began to lament,\nand cried with all his might, brother wolf, come to my help, the\nmusician has betrayed me.  The wolf drew down the little tree,\nbit the cord in two, and freed the fox, who went with him to take\nrevenge on the musician.  They found the tied-up hare, whom\nlikewise they rescued, and then they all sought the enemy\ntogether.\nThe musician had once more played his fiddle as he went on his\nway, and this time he had been more fortunate.  The sound\nreached the ears of a poor wood-cutter, who instantly, whether\nhe would or no, gave up his work and came with his hatchet under\nhis arm to listen to the music.  At last comes the right\ncompanion, said the musician, for I was seeking a human being,\nand no wild beast.  And he began and played so beautifully and\ndelightfully that the poor man stood there as if bewitched, and\nhis heart leaped with gladness.  And as he thus stood, the wolf,\nthe fox, and the hare came up, and he saw well that they had some\nevil design.  So he raised his glittering axe and placed\nhimself before the musician, as if to say, whoso wishes to touch\nhim let him beware, for he will have to deal with me.  Then the\nbeasts were terrified and ran back into the forest.  The\nmusician, however, played once more to the man out of\ngratitude, and then went onwards.\n", "The Pack of Ragamuffins": "The cock once said to the hen, it is now the time when the nuts\nare ripe, so let us go to the hill together and for once\neat our fill before the squirrel takes them all away.  Yes,\nreplied the hen, come, we will have some fun together.  Then\nthey went away to the hill, and as it was a bright day they\nstayed till evening.  Now I do not know whether it was that they\nhad eaten till they were too fat, or whether they had become\ntoo proud, but they would not go home on foot, and the cock had\nto build a little carriage of nut-shells.  When it was ready,\nthe little hen seated herself in it and said to the cock, you can\njust harness yourself to it.  I like that. Said the cock.  I\nwould rather go home on foot than let myself be harnessed to it.\nNo, that is not our bargain.  I do not mind being coachman\nand sitting on the box, but drag it myself I will not.\nAs they were thus disputing, a duck quacked at them, you thieving\nfolks, who bade you go to my nut-hill.  Wait, you shall suffer\nfor it, and ran with open beak at the cock.  But the cock also was\nnot idle, and fell boldly on the duck, and at last wounded her\nso with his spurs that she begged for mercy, and willingly let\nherself be harnessed to the carriage as a punishment.  The\nlittle cock now seated himself on the box and was coachman, and\nthereupon they went off at a gallop, with the cock crying, duck,\ngo as fast as you can.  When they had driven a part of the way\nthey met two foot-passengers, a pin and a needle.  They cried,\nstop. Stop. And said that it would soon be as dark as pitch,\nand then they could not go a step further, and that it was so\ndirty on the road, and asked if they could not get into the\ncarriage for a while.  They had been at the tailor's public-house\nby the gate, and had stayed too long over the beer.  As they were\nthin people, who did not take up much room,\nthe cock let them both get in, but they had to promise him and his\nlittle hen not to step on their feet.  Late in the evening they\ncame to an inn, and as they did not like to go further by night,\nand as the duck also was not strong on her feet, and fell from\none side to the other, they went in.  The host at first made many\nobjections, his house was already full, besides he thought they\ncould not be very distinguished persons.  But at last, as they\nmade pleasant speeches, and told him that he should have the\negg which the little hen had laid on the way, and should likewise\nkeep the duck, which laid one every day, he at length said that\nthey might stay the night.  And now they had themselves well\nserved, and feasted and had a high good time.  Early in the\nmorning, when day was breaking and every one was asleep, the\ncock awoke the hen, brought the egg, pecked it open, and they\nate it together, but they threw the shell on the hearth.  Then\nthey went to the needle which was still asleep, took it by\nthe head and stuck it into the cushion of the landlord's chair,\nand put the pin in his towel, and at last without more ado they\nfled away over the heath.  The duck who liked to sleep in\nthe open air and had stayed in the yard, heard them going away,\nmade herself merry and found a stream, down which she swam, which\nwas a much quicker way of traveling than being harnessed to a\ncarriage.  The host did not get out of bed until a couple of\nhours later.  He washed himself and was about to dry himself, when\nthe pin went over his face and made a red scratch from one ear\nto the other.  After this he went into the kitchen and wanted\nto light a pipe, but when he came to the hearth the egg-shell\ndarted into his eyes.  This morning everything attacks my head,\nsaid he, and angrily sat down on his grandfather's chair, but\nhe quickly started up again and cried, ow, for the needle had\npricked him still worse than the pin, and not in the head.  Now\nhe was thoroughly angry, and suspected the guests who had come\nso late the night before.  And when he went in search of them,\nthey were gone.  Then he made a vow to take no more ragamuffins\ninto his house, for they consume much, pay for nothing, and play\nmischievous tricks into the bargain by way of gratitude.\n", "The Bremen Town-Musicians": "A certain man had a donkey, which had carried the corn-sacks\nto the mill indefatigably for many a long year.  But his\nstrength was going, and he was growing more and more unfit\nfor work.  Then his master began to consider how he might\nbest save his keep.  But the donkey, seeing that no good wind\nwas blowing, ran away and set out on the road to bremen.  There,\nhe thought, I can surely be a town-musician.  When he had walked\nsome distance, he found a hound lying on the road, gasping like\none who had run till he was tired.  What are you gasping so for,\nyou big fellow, asked the donkey.\nAh, replied the hound, as I am old, and daily grow weaker, and\nno longer can hunt, my master wanted to kill me, so I took to\nflight, but now how am I to earn my bread.\nI tell you what, said the donkey, I am going to bremen, and\nshall be town-musician there.  Go with me and engage yourself\nalso as a musician.  I will play the lute, and you shall beat\nthe kettle-drum.\nThe hound agreed, and on they went.\nBefore long they came to a cat, sitting on the path, with a face\nlike three rainy days.  Now then, old shaver, what has gone\naskew with you, asked the donkey.\nWho can be merry when his neck is in danger, answered the cat.\nBecause I am now getting old, and my teeth are worn to\nstumps, and I prefer to sit by the fire and spin, rather than\nhunt about after mice, my mistress wanted to drown me, so I\nran away.  But now good advice is scarce.  Where am I to go.\nGo with us to bremen.  You understand night-music, you\ncan be a town-musician.\nThe cat thought well of it, and went with them.  After this the\nthree fugitives came to a farm-yard, where the cock was sitting\nupon the gate, crowing with all his might.  Your crow goes\nthrough and through one, said the donkey.  What is the matter.\nI have been foretelling fine weather, because it is the day on\nwhich our lady washes the christ-child's little shirts, and\nwants to dry them, said the cock.  But guests are coming for\nsunday, so the housewife has no pity, and has told the cook that\nshe intends to eat me in the soup to-morrow, and this evening\nI am to have my head cut off.  Now I am crowing at the top of\nmy lungs while still I can.\nAh, but red-comb, said the donkey, you had better come away\nwith us.  We are going to bremen.  You can find something better\nthan death everywhere.  You have a good voice, and if we make\nmusic together it must have some quality.\nThe cock agreed to this plan, and all four went on together.\nThey could not reach the city of bremen in one day, however,\nand in the evening they came to a forest where they meant to\npass the night.  The donkey and the hound laid themselves down\nunder a large tree, the cat and the cock settled themselves in\nthe branches.  But the cock flew right to the top, where he was\nmost safe.  Before he went to sleep he looked round on all four\nsides, and thought he saw in the distance a little spark burning.\nSo he called out to his companions that there must be a house\nnot far off, for he saw a light.  The donkey said, if so, we\nhad better get up and go on, for the shelter here is bad.  The\nhound thought too that a few bones with some meat on would do\nhim good.\nSo they made their way to the place where the light was, and\nsoon saw it shine brighter and grow larger, until they came to\na well-lighted robbers, house.  The donkey, as the biggest, went\nto the window and looked in.\nWhat do you see, my grey-horse, asked the cock.  What do I\nsee, answered the donkey.  A table covered with good things to\neat and drink, and robbers sitting at it enjoying themselves.\nThat would be the sort of thing for us, said the cock.  Yes,\nyes.  Ah, if only we were there, said the donkey.\nThen the animals took counsel together how they should manage\nto drive away the robbers, and at last they thought of a plan.\nThe donkey was to place himself with his fore-feet upon the\nwindow-ledge, the hound was to jump on the donkey's back, the\ncat was to climb upon the dog, and lastly the cock was to fly\nup and perch upon the head of the cat.\nWhen this was done, at a given signal, they began to perform\ntheir music together.  The donkey brayed, the hound barked,\nthe cat mewed, and the cock crowed.  Then they burst through the\nwindow into the room, shattering the glass.  At this horrible din,\nthe robbers sprang up, thinking no otherwise than that a ghost\nhad come in, and fled in a great fright out into the forest.  The\nfour companions now sat down at the table, well content with\nwhat was left, and ate as if they were going to fast for a\nmonth.\nAs soon as the four minstrels had done, they put out the light,\nand each sought for himself a sleeping-place according to his\nnature and what suited him.  The donkey laid himself down upon\nsome straw in the yard, the hound behind the door, the cat upon\nthe hearth near the warm ashes, and the cock perched himself\nupon a beam of the roof.  And being tired from their long walk,\nthey soon went to sleep.\nWhen it was past midnight, and the robbers saw from afar that\nthe light was no longer burning in their house, and all appeared\nquiet, the captain said, we ought not to have let ourselves\nbe frightened out of our wits, and ordered one of them to go\nand examine the house.\nThe messenger finding all still, went into the kitchen to light\na candle, and, taking the glistening fiery eyes of the cat for\nlive coals, he held a lucifer-match to them to light it.  But\nthe cat did not understand the joke, and flew in his face, spitting\nand scratching.  He was dreadfully frightened, and ran to the\nback-door, but the dog, who lay there sprang up and bit his\nleg.  And as he ran across the yard by the dunghill, the donkey\ngave him a smart kick with its hind foot.  The cock, too, who had\nbeen awakened by the noise, and had become lively, cried down\nfrom the beam, cock-a-doodle-doo.\nThen the robber ran back as fast as he could to his captain, and\nsaid, ah, there is a horrible witch sitting in the house, who\nspat on me and scratched my face with her long claws.  And by\nthe door stands a man with a knife, who stabbed me in the leg.\nAnd in the yard there lies a black monster, who beat me with\na wooden club.  And above, upon the roof, sits the judge, who\ncalled out, bring the rogue here to me.  So I got away as well\nas I could.\nAfter this the robbers never again dared enter the house.\nBut it suited the four musicians of bremen so well that they\ndid not care to leave it any more.  And the mouth of him who\nlast told this story is still warm.\n", "The Louse and the Flea": "A louse and a flea kept house together and were brewing beer\nin an egg-shell.  Then the little louse fell in and burnt\nherself.  At this the little flea began to scream loudly. Then\nsaid the little room-door, little flea, why are you screaming.\nBecause the louse has burnt herself.\nThen the little door began to creak.  At this a little broom in\nthe corner said, why are you creaking, little door.  Have I not\nreason to creak.\n          The little louse has burnt herself,\n          the little flea is weeping.\nSo the little broom began to sweep frantically.  Then a little cart\npassed by and said, why are you sweeping, little broom.  Have\nI not reason to sweep.\n          The little louse has burnt herself,\n          the little flea is weeping,\n          the little door is creaking.\nSo the little cart said, then I will run, and began to run like\nmad.  Then said the ash-heap by which it ran, why are you running\nso, little cart.  Have I not reason to run.\n          The little louse has burnt herself,\n          the little flea is weeping,\n          the little door is creaking,\n          the little broom is sweeping.\nThe ash-heap said, then I will burn furiously, and began to burn\nin clear flames.  A little tree stood near the ash-heap and\nsaid, ash-heap, why are you burning.  Have I not reason to burn.\n          The little louse has burnt herself,\n          the little flea is weeping,\n          the little door is creaking,\n          the little broom is sweeping,\n          the little cart is running.\nThe little tree said, then I will shake myself, and began to\nshake herself so that all her leaves fell off.  A girl who came\nup with her water-pitcher saw that, and said, little tree, why are\nyou shaking yourself.  Have I not reason to shake myself.\n          The little louse has burnt herself,\n          the little flea is weeping,\n          the little door is creaking,\n          the little broom is sweeping,\n          the little cart is running,\n          the little ash-heap is burning.\nAt this the girl said, then I will break my little water-pitcher.\nAnd she broke her little water-pitcher.  Then said the little\nspring from which ran the water, girl, why are you breaking your\nwater-pitcher.  Have I not reason to break my water-pitcher.\n          The little louse has burnt herself,\n          the little flea is weeping,\n          the little door is creaking,\n          the little broom is sweeping,\n          the little cart is running,\n          the little ash-heap is burning,\n          the little tree is shaking itself.\nOh, ho, said the spring, then I will begin to flow, and began\nto flow violently.  And in the water everything was drowned,\nthe girl, the little tree, the little ash-heap, the little\ncart, the broom, the little door, the little flea, the little\nlouse, all together.\n", "The Tailor in Heaven": "One very fine day it came to pass that the good God wished to enjoy\nhimself in the heavenly garden, and took all the apostles and saints\nwith him, so that no one stayed in heaven but saint peter.  The Lord\nhad commanded him to let no one in during his absence, so peter\nstood by the door and kept watch.\nBefore long someone knocked.  Peter asked who was there, and what\nhe wanted.  I am a poor, honest tailor who prays for admission,\nreplied a smooth voice.  Honest indeed, said peter, like the thief\non the gallows.  You have been light-fingered and have snipped\nfolks, clothes away.  You will not get into heaven.  The Lord has\nforbidden me to let anyone in while he is out.  Come, do be\nmerciful, cried the tailor.  Little scraps which fall off the table\nof their own accord are not stolen, and are not worth speaking\nabout.  Look, I am lame, and have blisters on my feet from walking\nhere, I cannot possibly turn back again.  Just let me in, and I will\ndo all the dirty work.  I will carry the children, and wash their\nclothes, and scrub and clean the benches on which they have been\nplaying, and patch all their torn frocks.  Saint peter let himself\nbe moved by pity, and opened the door of heaven just wide enough for\nthe lame tailor to slip his lean body in.  He was forced to sit down\nin a corner behind the door, and told to stay quietly and peaceably\nthere, in order that the Lord, when he returned, might not observe\nhim and be angry.  The tailor obeyed, but once when saint peter went\noutside the door, he got up, and full of curiosity, peeped into\nevery corner of heaven, and inspected the arrangement of the whole\nplace.  At length he came to a spot where many beautiful and\nprecious chairs were standing, and in the midst was a seat all of\ngold which was set with shining jewels.  Likewise it was much higher\nthan the other chairs, and a footstool of gold was before it.  It\nwas the seat, however, on which the Lord sat when he was at home,\nand from which he could see all that happened on earth.  The tailor\nstood still, and looked at the seat for a long time, for it pleased\nhim better than all else.  At last he could master his curiosity no\nlonger, and climbed up and seated himself in the chair.  Then he saw\neverything which was happening on earth, and observed an ugly old\nwoman who was standing washing by the side of a stream, secretly\nlaying two veils on one side for herself.  The sight of this\nmade the tailor so angry that he laid hold of the golden footstool,\nand threw it down to earth through heaven, at the old thief.  But\nsince he could not bring the stool back again, he slipped quietly\nout of the chair, seated himself in his place behind the door, and\nbehaved as if he had never stirred from the spot.\nWhen the Lord and master returned again with his heavenly\ncompanions,\nhe did not see the tailor behind the door, but when he seated\nhimself on his chair the footstool was missing.  He asked saint\npeter what had become of the stool, but he did not know.  Then he\nasked if he had let anyone come in.  I know of no one who has been\nhere, answered peter, but a lame tailor, who is still\nsitting behind the door.  Then the Lord had the tailor brought\nbefore him, and asked him if he had taken away the stool, and where\nhe had put it.  Oh, Lord, answered the tailor joyously, I threw it\nin my anger down to earth at an old woman whom I saw stealing two\nveils at the washing.  Oh, you knave, said the Lord, were I to\njudge as you judge, how do you think you could have escaped so long.\nI should long ago have had no chairs, benches, seats, nay, not even\nan oven-fork, but should have thrown everything down at the sinners.\nHenceforth you can stay no longer in heaven, but must go outside the\ndoor again.  Then go where you will.  No one shall give punishment\nhere, but I alone, the Lord.\nPeter was obliged to take the tailor out of heaven again, and as\nhe had torn shoes, and feet covered with blisters, he took a stick\nin his hand, and went to wait-a-while, where the good soldiers sit\nand make merry.\n", "The Wedding of Mrs. Fox (Two Stories)": "There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who\nbelieved that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to\nput her to the test.  He stretched himself out under the bench,\ndid not move a limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead.\nMrs. Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, miss\ncat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking.  When it became known\nthat the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.  The\nmaid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking.  She\nwent and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said,\n     what may you be about, miss cat.\n     Do you sleep or do you wake.\nShe answered,\n     I am not sleeping, I am waking,\n     would you know what I am making.\n     I am boiling warm beer with butter,\n     will you be my guest for supper.\nNo, thank you, miss, said the fox, what is mrs. Fox doing.\nThe maid replied,\n     she is sitting in her room,\n     moaning in her gloom,\n     weeping her little eyes quite red,\n     because old mr. Fox is dead.\nDo just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like\nto woo her.  Certainly, young  sir.\n     The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,\n     the door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,\n     mistress fox, are you inside.\n     Oh, yes, my little cat, she cried.\n     A wooer he stands at the door out there.\n     What does he look like, my dear.\nHas he nine as beautiful tails as the late mr. Fox.  Oh, no,\nanswered the cat, he has only one.  Then I will not have him.\nMiss cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away.  Soon afterwards\nthere was another knock, and another fox was at the door who\nwished to woo mrs. Fox.  He had two tails, but he did not fare\nbetter than the first.  After this still more came, each with one\ntail more than the other, but they were all turned away, until\nat last one came who had nine tails, like old mr. Fox.  When the\nwidow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat,\n     now open the gates and doors all wide,\n     and carry old mr. Fox outside.\nBut just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old mr. Fox\nstirred under the bench, and cudgeled all the rabble, and drove\nthem and mrs. Fox out of the house.\nWhen old mr. Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked\nat the door, and the cat who was servant to mrs. Fox, opened it\nfor him.  The wolf greeted her and said,\n     good day, mrs. Cat of kehrewit,\n     how comes it that alone you sit.\n     What are you making good.\nThe cat replied,\n     in milk I'm breaking bread so sweet,\n     will you be my guest, and eat.\nNo, thank you, mrs. Cat, answered the wolf.  Is mrs. Fox not\nat home.\nThe cat said,\n     she sits upstairs in her room,\n     bewailing her sorrowful doom,\n     bewailing her trouble so sore,\n     for old mr. Fox is no more.\nThe wolf answered,\n     if she's in want of a husband now,\n     then will it please her to step below.\n     The cat runs quickly up the stair,\n     and lets her tail fly here and there,\n     until she comes to the parlor door.\n     With her five gold rings at the door she knocks,\n     are you within, good mistress fox.\n     If you're in want of a husband now,\n     then will it please you to step below.\nMrs. Fox asked, has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a\npointed mouth.  No, answered the cat.  Then he won't do for me.\nWhen the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion,\nand all the beasts of the forest, one after the other.  But one\nof the good qualities which old mr. Fox had possessed, was always\nlacking, and the cat had continually to send the suitors away.\nAt length came a young fox.  Then mrs. Fox said, has the\ngentleman red stockings on, and has he a little pointed mouth.\nYes, said the cat, he has.  Then let him come upstairs, said\nmrs. Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast.\n     Sweep me the room as clean as you can,\n     up with the window, fling out my old man.\n     For many a fine fat mouse he brought,\n     yet of his wife he never thought,\n     but ate up every one he caught.\nThen the wedding was solemnized with young mr. Fox, and there was\nmuch rejoicing and dancing, and if they have not left off, they\nare dancing still.\n", "Herr Korbes": "There were once a cock and a hen who wanted to take a journey\ntogether.  So the cock built a beautiful carriage, which had four\nred wheels, and harnessed four mice to it.  The hen seated herself\nin it with the cock, and they drove away together.  Not long\nafterwards they met a cat who said, where are you going.  The\ncock replied, we are going to the house of herr korbes.  Take me\nwith you, said the cat.  The cock answered, most willingly, get\nup behind, lest you fall off in front.\nTake great care not to dirty my little red wheels.  And you little\nwheels, roll on, and you little mice pipe out, as we go forth on\nour way to the house of herr korbes.\nAfter this came a millstone, then an egg, then a duck, then a pin,\nand at last a needle, who all seated themselves in the carriage,\nand drove with them.  When they reached the house of herr korbes,\nhowever, herr korbes was not there.  The mice drew the carriage\ninto the barn, the hen flew with the cock upon a perch.  The cat\nsat down by the hearth, the duck on the well-pole.  The egg rolled\nitself into a towel, the pin stuck itself into the chair-cushion,\nthe needle jumped on to the bed in the middle of the pillow, and\nthe millstone laid itself over the door.  Then herr korbes came\nhome, went to the hearth, and was about to light the fire, when\nthe cat threw a quantity of ashes in his face.  He ran into the\nkitchen in a great hurry to wash it off, and the duck splashed some\nwater in his face.  He wanted to dry it with the towel, but the\negg rolled up against him, broke, and glued up his eyes.  He\nwanted to rest, and sat down in the chair, and then the pin\npricked him.  He fell in a passion, and threw himself on his bed,\nbut as soon as he laid his head on the pillow, the needle pricked\nhim, so that he screamed aloud, and was just going to run out\ninto the wide world in his rage, but when he came to the\nhouse-door, the millstone fell down and struck him dead.  Herr\nkorbes must have been a very wicked man.\n", "Jorinda and Joringel": "There was once an old castle in the midst of a large and dense\nforest, and in it an old woman who was a witch dwelt all\nalone.  In the day-time she changed herself into a car or a\nscreech-owl, but in the evening she took her proper shape\nagain as a human being.  She could lure wild beasts and birds\nto her, and then she killed and boiled and roasted them.  If\nanyone came within one hundred paces of the castle he was\nobliged to stand still, and could not stir from the place until\nshe bade him be free.  But whenever an innocent maiden came\nwithin this circle, she changed her into a bird, and shut her\nup in a wicker-work cage, and carried the cage into a room in the\ncastle.  She had about seven thousand cages of rare birds in\nthe castle.\nNow, there was once a maiden who was called jorinda, who was\nfairer than all other girls.  She and a handsome youth named\njoringel had promised to marry each other.  They were still in\nthe days of betrothal, and their greatest happiness was being\ntogether.  One day in order that they might be able to talk\ntogether in peace they went for a walk in the forest.  Take\ncare, said joringel, that you do not go too near the castle.\nIt was a beautiful evening.  The sun shone brightly between\nthe trunks of the trees into the dark green of the forest, and\nthe turtle-doves sang mournfully upon the beech trees.\nJorinda wept now and then.  She sat down in the sunshine and\nwas sorrowful.  Joringel was sorrowful too.  They were as\nsad as if they were about to die.  Then they looked around them,\nand were quite at a loss, for they did not know by which way\nthey should go home.  The sun was still half above the\nmountain and half under.\nJoringel looked through the bushes, and saw the old walls of the\ncastle close at hand.  He was horror-stricken and filled with\ndeadly fear.  Jorinda was singing,\n          my little bird, with the necklace red,\n          sings sorrow, sorrow, sorrow,\n          he sings that the dove must soon be dead,\n          sings sorrow, sor - jug, jug, jug.\nJoringel looked for jorinda.  She was changed into a nightingale,\nand sang, jug, jug, jug.  A screech-owl with glowing eyes\nflew three times round about her, and three times cried, to-whoo,\nto-whoo, to-whoo.\nJoringel could not move.  He stood there like a stone, and\ncould neither weep nor speak, nor move hand or foot.\nThe sun had now set.  The owl flew into the thicket, and directly\nafterwards there came out of it a crooked old woman, yellow\nand lean, with large red eyes and a hooked nose, the point of\nwhich reached to her chin.  She muttered to herself, caught the\nnightingale, and took it away in her hand.\nJoringel could neither speak nor move from the spot.  The\nnightingale was gone.  At last the woman came back, and said\nin a hollow voice, greet you, zachiel.  If the moon shines on\nthe cage, zachiel, let him loose at once.  Then joringel was\nfreed.  He fell on his knees before the woman and begged that\nshe would give him back his jorinda, but she said that he\nshould never have her again, and went away.  He called, he wept,\nhe lamented, but all in vain, hooh, what is to become of me.\nJoringel went away, and at last came to a strange village, where\nhe kept sheep for a long time.  He often walked round and round\nthe castle, but not too near to it.  At last he dreamt one\nnight that he found a blood-red flower, in the middle of\nwhich was a beautiful large pearl.  That he picked the flower\nand went with it to the castle, and that everything he touched\nwith the flower was freed from enchantment.  He also dreamt\nthat by means of it he recovered his jorinda.\nIn the morning, when he awoke, he began to seek over hill and\ndale for such a flower.  He sought until the ninth day, and then,\nearly in the morning, he found the blood-red flower.  In the\nmiddle of it there was a large dew-drop, as big as the finest\npearl.\nDay and night he journeyed with this flower to the castle.  When\nhe was within a hundred paces of it he was not held fast, but\nwalked on to the door.  Joringel was full of joy.  He touched the\ndoor with the flower, and it sprang open.  He walked in through\nthe courtyard, and listened for the sound of the birds.  At\nlast he heard it.  He went on and found the room from whence it\ncame, and there the witch was feeding the birds in the seven\nthousand cages.\nWhen she saw joringel she was angry, very angry, and scolded\nand spat poison and gall at him, but she could not come within\ntwo paces of him.  He did not take any notice of her, but went\nand looked at the cages with the birds.  But there were many\nhundred nightingales, how was he to find his jorinda again.\nJust then he saw the old woman quietly take away a cage with\na bird in it, and go towards the door.\nSwiftly he sprang towards her, touched the cage with the flower,\nand also the old woman.  She could now no longer bewitch anyone.\nAnd jorinda was standing there, clasping him round the neck,\nand she was as beautiful as ever.  Then all the other birds\nwere turned into maidens again, and he went home with his jorinda,\nand they lived happily together for a long time.\n", "The Wolf and the Man": "Once upon a time the fox was talking to the wolf of the\nstrength of man.  How no animal could withstand him, and how\nall were obliged to emply cunning in order to protect themselves\nfrom him.  Then the wolf answered, if I had but the chance of\nseeing a man for once, I would set on him notwithstanding.\nI can help you to do that, said the fox.  Come to me early\nto-morrow morning, and I will show you one.  The wolf presented\nhimself betimes, and the fox took him out on the road by which\nthe huntsmen went daily.  First came an old discharged soldier.\nIs that a man, inquired the wolf.  No, answered the fox, that\nwas one.  Afterwards came a little boy who was going to school.\nIs that a man.  No, that will be one.  At length came a\nhunter with his double-barelled gun at his back, and hanger by\nhis side.  Said the fox to the wolf, look, there comes a man,\nyou must attack him, but I will take myself off to my hole.  The\nwolf then rushed on the man.  When the huntsman saw him he\nsaid, it is a pity that I have not loaded with a bullet, aimed,\nand fired his small shot in his face.  The wolf pulled a very\nwry grimace, but did not let himself be frightened, and attacked\nhim again, on which the huntsman gave him the second barrel.  The\nwolf swallowed his pain, and rushed on the huntsman, but he\ndrew out his bright hanger, and gave him a few cuts with it\nright and left, so that, bleeding everywhere, he ran howling back\nto the fox.  Well, brother wolf, said the fox, how have you\ngot on with man.  Ah, replied the wolf, I never imagined the\nstrength of man to be what it is.  First, he took a stick from\nhis shoulder, and blew into it, and then something flew into\nmy face which tickled me terribly.  Then he breathed once\nmore into the stick, and it flew into my nose like lightning and\nhail.  When I was quite close, he drew a white rib out of his\nbody, and he beat me so with it that I was all but left lying\ndead.  See what a braggart you are, said the fox.  You throw\nyour hatchet so far that you cannot fetch it back again.\n", "The Wolf and the Fox": "The wolf had the fox with him, and whatsoever the wolf\nwished, that the fox was compelled to do, for he was the\nweaker, and he would gladly have been rid of his master.\nIt chanced that once as they were going through the forest, the wolf\nsaid, red-fox, get me something to eat, or else I will eat\nyou yourself.  Then the fox answered, I know a farm-yard where\nthere are two young lambs.  If you are inclined, we will fetch one\nof them.  That suited the wolf, and they went thither, and the fox\nstole the little lamb, took it to the wolf, and went away.  The\nwolf devoured it, but was not satisfied with one.  He wanted the\nother as well, and went to get it.  But as he did it so clumsily,\nthe mother of the little lamb heard him, and began to cry out\nterribly, and to bleat so that the farmers came running there.\nThey found the wolf, and beat him so mercilessly, that he went\nto the fox limping and howling.  You have misled me finely, said\nhe.  I wanted to fetch the other lamb, and the country folks\nsurprised me, and have beaten me to a jelly.  The fox replied,\nwhy are you such a glutton.\nNext day they again went into the country, and the greedy wolf\nonce more said, red-fox, get me something to eat, or I will\neat you yourself.  Then answered the fox, I know a farm-house\nwhere the wife is baking pancakes to-night.  We will get some\nof them for ourselves.  They went there, and the fox slipped\nround the house, and peeped and sniffed about until he discovered\nwhere the dish was, and then snatched six pancakes and carried\nthem to the wolf.\nThere is something for you to eat, said he to him, and then went\nhis way.  The wolf swallowed down the pancakes in an instant,\nand said, they make one want more, and went thither and tore the\nwhole dish down so that it broke in pieces.  This made such\na great noise that the woman came out, and when she saw the\nwolf she called the people, who hurried there, and beat him as\nlong as their sticks would hold together, till with two lame\nlegs, and howling loudly, he returned to the fox in the forest.\nHow abominably you have misled me, cried he, the peasants caught\nme, and tanned my skin for me.  But the fox replied, why are\nyou such a glutton.\nOn the third day, when they were out together, and the wolf\ncould only limp along painfully, he again said, red-fox, get me\nsomething to eat, or I will eat your yourself.  The fox\nanswered, I\nknow a man who has been killing, and the salted meat is lying\nin a barrel in the cellar.  We will get that.  Said the wolf, I\nwill go when you do, that you may help me if I am not able to\nget away.  I am willing, said the fox, and showed him the by-paths\nand ways by which at length they reached the cellar.  There was\nmeat in abundance, and the wolf attacked it instantly and thought,\nthere is plenty of time before I need leave off.  The fox liked\nit also, but looked about everywhere, and often ran to the hole\nby which they had come in, to find out if his body was still\nthin enough to slip through it.  The wolf said, dear fox, tell\nme why you are running here and there so much, and jumping in\nand out.\nI must see that no one is coming, replied the crafty fellow.\nDon't eat too much.  Then said the wolf, I shall not leave until\nthe barrel is empty.  In the meantime the farmer, who had heard\nthe noise of the fox's jumping, came into the cellar.  When the\nfox saw him he was out of the hole at one bound.  The wolf\nwanted to follow him, but he had made himself so fat with\neating that he could no longer get through, but stuck fast.  Then\ncame the farmer with a cudgel and struck him dead, but the fox\nbounded into the forest, glad to be rid of the old glutton.\n", "Clever Grethel": "There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with\nred heels, and when she walked out with them on, she\nturned herself this way and that, was quite happy and\nthought, you certainly are a pretty girl.  And when she\ncame home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of\nwine, and\nas wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever\nshe was cooking until she was satisfied, and said, the cook\nmust know what the food is like.\nIt came to pass that the master one day said to her, Gretel,\nthere is a guest coming this evening.  Prepare me two fowls\nvery daintily.  I will see to it, master, answered Gretel.\nShe killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on\nthe spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that\nthey might roast.  The fowls began to turn brown, and were\nnearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived.  Then Gretel\ncalled out to her master, if the guest does not come, I must\ntake the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a\nshame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their\njuiciest.  The master said, I will run myself, and fetch\nthe guest.  When the master had turned his back, Gretel laid\nthe spit with the fowls on one side, and thought, standing\nso long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty.  Who\nknows when they will come.  Meanwhile, I will run into the\ncellar, and take a drink.  She ran down, set a jug, said,\nGod bless it for you, Gretel, and took a good drink, and\nthought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted,\nand took yet another hearty draught.\nThen she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted\nthem, and drove the spit merrily round.  But as the roast\nmeat smelt so good, Gretel thought, something must be wrong,\nit ought to be tasted.  She touched it with her finger, and\nsaid, ah, how good fowls are.  It certainly is a sin and a\nshame that they are not eaten\nat the right time.  She ran to the window, to see if the\nmaster was not coming with his guest, but she saw no one, and\nwent back to the fowls and thought, one of the wings is burning.\nI had better take it off and eat it.  So she cut it off, ate it,\nand enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought, the other\nmust go down too, or else master will observe that something is\nmissing.  When the two wings were eaten, she went and looked\nfor her master, and did not see him.  It suddenly occurred to\nher, who knows.  They are perhaps not coming at all, and have\nturned in somewhere.  Then she said, well, Gretel, enjoy\nyourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and\neat it up entirely.  When it is eaten you will have some peace,\nwhy should God's good gifts be spoilt.  So she ran\ninto the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the\none chicken in great glee.  When one of the chickens was\nswallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel\nlooked at the other and said, where one is, the other should\nbe likewise, the two go together.  What's right for the one is\nright for the other.  I think if I were to take another\ndraught it would do me no harm.  So she took another hearty\ndrink, and let the second chicken follow the first.\nWhile she was making the most of it, her master came and cried,\nhurry up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me.  Yes,\nsir, I will soon serve up, answered Gretel.  Meantime the master\nlooked to see that the table was properly laid, and took the\ngreat knife, wherewith he was going to carve the chickens, and\nsharpened it on the steps.  Presently the guest came, and\nknocked politely and courteously at the house-door.  Gretel ran,\nand looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,\nshe put her finger to her lips and said, hush. Hush.  Go away\nas quickly as you can, if my master catches you it will be the\nworse for you.  He certainly did ask you to supper, but his\nintention is to cut off your two ears.  Just listen how he\nis sharpening the knife for it.  The guest heard the sharpening, and\nhurried down the steps again as fast as he could.  Gretel was\nnot idle.  She ran screaming to her master, and cried, you have\ninvited a fine guest.  Why, Gretel, what do you mean by that.\nYes, said she, he has taken the chickens which I was just\ngoing to serve\nup, off the dish, and has run away with them.  That's a nice\ntrick, said her master, and lamented the fine chickens.  If\nhe had but left me one, so that something remained for me to\neat.  He called to him to stop, but the guest pretended not to\nhear.  Then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand,\ncrying, just one, just one, meaning that the guest should leave\nhim just one chicken, and not take both.  The guest, however,\nthought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his\nears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to\ntake them both home with him.\n", "The Death of the Little Hen": "Once upon a time the little hen went with the little cock\nto the nut-hill, and they agreed together that whichsoever of\nthem found a kernel of a nut should share it with the other.\nThen the hen found a large, large nut, but said nothing about\nit, intending to eat the kernel herself.  The kernel, however,\nwas so large that she could not swallow it, and it remained\nsticking in her throat, so that she was alarmed lest she should\nbe choked.  Then she cried, cock, I entreat you to run as fast\nas you can and fetch me some water, or I shall choke.  The little\ncock did run as fast as he could to the spring, and said, stream,\nyou are to give me some water, the little hen is lying on the\nnut-hill, and she has swallowed a large nut, and is choking.  The\nwell answered, first run to the bride, and get her to give you\nsome red silk.  The little cock ran to the bride and said, bride,\nyou are to give me some red silk, I want to give red silk to the\nwell, the well is to give me some water, I am to take the water\nto the little hen who is lying on the nut-hill and has\nswallowed a great nut-kernel, and is choking with it.  The bride\nanswered, first run and bring me my little wreath which is\nhanging to a willow.  So the little cock ran to the willow, and\ndrew the wreath from the branch and took it to the bride, and\nthe bride gave him some red silk for it, which he took to the\nwell, who gave him some water for it.  Then the little cock took\nthe water to the hen, but when he got there the hen had choked in\nthe meantime, and lay there dead and did not move.  Then the\ncock was so distressed that he cried aloud, and every animal\ncame to lament the little hen, and six mice built a little\ncarriage to carry her to her grave, and when the carriage was\nready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock drove.  On\nthe way, however, they met the fox, who said, where are you\ngoing, little cock.  I am going to bury my little hen.  May\nI drive with you.  Yes, but seat yourself at the back of the\ncarriage, for in the front my little horses could not drag you.\nThen the procession went onwards, and they reached a stream.\nHow are we to cross over, said the little cock.  A straw was\nlying by the stream and it said, I will lay myself straight\nacross, and then you\ncan drive over me.  But when the six mice came to the bridge,\nthe straw slipped and fell into the water, and the six mice\nall fell in and were drowned.  Then they were again in difficulty,\nand a coal came and said, I am large enough, I will lay myself\nacross, and you shall drive over me.  So the coal also laid\nitself across the water, but unhappily just touched it, at which\nthe coal hissed, was extinguished and died.  When a stone saw\nthat, it took pity on the little cock, wished to help him, and\nlaid itself over the water.  Then the cock drew the carriage\nhimself, but when he got it over and reached the shore with the\ndead hen, and was about to draw over the others who were sitting\nbehind as well, there were too many of them, the carriage ran\nback, and they all fell into the water together, and were drowned.\nThen the little cock was left alone with the dead hen, and dug a\ngrave for her and laid her in it, and made a mound above it, on\nwhich he sat down and fretted until he died too, and then everyone\nwas dead.\n", "Gambling Hansel": "Once upon a time there was a man who did nothing but gamble, and\nfor that reason people never called him anything but gambling\nHansel, and as he never ceased to gamble, he played away his house\nand all that he had.  Now the very day before his creditors were\nto take his house from him, came the Lord and St. Peter, and\nasked him to give them shelter for the night.  Then gambling Hansel\nsaid, for my part, you may stay the night, but I cannot give you\na bed or anything to eat.  So the Lord said he was just to take\nthem in, and they themselves would buy something to eat, to which\ngambling Hansel made no objection.  Thereupon St. Peter gave him\nthree groschen, and said he was to go to the baker's and fetch\nsome bread.  So gambling Hansel went, but when he reached the house\nwhere the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they,\nalthough they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously,\nand said, Hansel, do come in.  Oh, said he, do you want to win\nthree groschen too.  On this they would not let him go.  So he\nwent in, and played away the three groschen also.  Meanwhile\nSt. Peter and the Lord were waiting, and as he was so long in\ncoming, they set out to meet him.  When gambling Hansel came,\nhowever, he pretended that the money had fallen into the gutter,\nand kept raking about in it all the while to find it, but\nour Lord already\nknew that he had lost it in play.  St. Peter again gave him\nthree groschen, and now he did not allow himself to be led away\nonce more, but fetched them the loaf.  Our Lord then inquired if\nhe had no wine, and he said, alack, sir, the casks are all empty.\nBut the Lord said he was to go down into the cellar, for the best\nwine was still there.  For a long time he would not believe\nthis, but at length he said, well, I will go down, but I know\nthat there is none there.  When he turned the tap, however, lo\nand behold, the best of wine ran out.  So he took it to them, and\nthe two passed the night there.  Early next day our Lord told\ngambling Hansel that he might beg three favors.  The Lord\nexpected that he would ask to go to heaven, but gambling Hansel\nasked for a pack of cards with which he could win everything,\nfor dice with which he would win everything, and for a tree\nwhereon every kind of fruit would grow, and from which no one who\nhad climbed up, could descend until he bade him do so.  The Lord\ngave him all that he had asked, and departed with St. Peter.\nAnd now gambling Hansel at once set about gambling in real\nearnest, and before long he had gained half the world.  Upon this\nSt. Peter said to the Lord, Lord, this thing must not go on, at\nlast he will win the whole world.  We must send death to him.\nAnd they sent death to him.  When death appeared, gambling Hansel\nhad just seated himself at the gaming-table, and death said,\nHansel, come out a while.  But gambling Hansel said, just wait\na little until the game is done, and in the meantime get up into\nthat tree out there, and gather a little fruit that we may have\nsomething to munch on our way.  Thereupon death climbed up, but\nwhen he wanted to come down again, he could not, and gambling\nHansel left him up there for seven years, during which time no one\ndied.\nSo St. Peter said to the Lord, Lord, this thing must not go on.\nPeople no longer die, we must go ourselves.  And they went\nthemselves, and the Lord commanded Hansel to let death come down.\nSo Hansel went at once to death and said to him, come down, and\ndeath took him directly and put an end to him.  They went away\ntogether and came to the next world, and then gambling\nHansel made straight for the door of heaven, and knocked at it.\nWho is there.  Gambling Hansel.  Ah, we will have nothing to do\nwith him.  Begone.  So he went to the door of purgatory, and\nknocked once more.  Who is there.  Gambling Hansel.  Ah, there is\nquite enough weeping and wailing here without him.  We do not\nwant to gamble, just go away again.  Then he went to the door of\nhell, and there they let him in.  There was, however, no one at\nhome but old lucifer and the crooked devils - the straight ones\nwere just busy in the world.  And no sooner was Hansel there than\nhe sat down to gamble again.  Lucifer, however, had nothing to\nlose, but his mis-shapen devils, and gambling Hansel won them\nfrom him, as with his cards he could not fail to do.  And now he\nwas off again with his crooked devils, and they went to hohenfurt\nand pulled up a hop-pole, and with it went to heaven and began to\nthrust the pole against it, and heaven began to crack.  So again\nSt. Peter said, Lord, this thing cannot go on, we must let him\nin, or he will overthrow the whole heaven.  And they let him in.\nBut gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was\nsuch a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they\nthemselves were saying.  Therefore St. Peter once more said,\nLord, this cannot go on, we must throw him down, or he will make\nall heaven rebellious.  So they went to him at once, and threw\nhim down, and his soul broke into fragments, and went into the\ngambling vagabonds who are living this very day.\n", "The Fox and the Geese": "The fox once came to a meadow in which sat a flock of fine fat\ngeese, on which he smiled and said, I come in the nick of time,\nyou are sitting together quite beautifully, so that I can eat you\nup one after the other.  The geese cackled with terror, sprang\nup, and began to wail and beg piteously for their lives.  But\nthe fox would listen to nothing, and said, there is no mercy\nto be had.  You must die.  At length one of them took heart and\nsaid,  if we poor geese are to yield up our lives, show us the\nonly possible favor and allow us one more prayer, that we may\nnot die in our sins, and then we will place ourselves in a row,\nso that you can always pick yourself out the fattest.  Yes,\nsaid the fox, that is reasonable, and a pious request.  Pray\naway, I will wait till you are done.  Then the first began a\ngood long prayer, for ever saying, ga, ga, and as she would\nmake no end, the second did not wait until her turn came, but\nbegan also, ga, ga.  The third\nand fourth followed her, and soon they were all cackling\ntogether.\nWhen they have done praying, the story shall be continued further,\nbut at present they are still praying unceasingly.\n", "The Poor Man and the Rich Man": "In olden times, when the Lord himself still used to walk about on\nthis earth amongst men, it once happened that he was tired and\novertaken by the darkness before he could reach an inn.  Now\nthere stood on the road before him two houses facing each other,\nthe one large and beautiful, the other small and poor.  The\nlarge one belonged to a rich man, and the small one to a poor\nman.\nThen the Lord thought, I shall be no burden to the rich man.\nI will stay the night with him.  Then the rich man heard someone\nknocking at his door, he opened the window and asked the stranger\nwhat he wanted.  The Lord answered, I only ask for a night's\nlodging.\nThen the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and\nas the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like\none who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and\nsaid, no, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and\nseeds.  And if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door,\nI might very soon go begging myself.  Go somewhere else for\na lodging, and with this he shut down the window and left the\nLord standing there.\nSo the Lord turned his back on the rich man, and went across\nto the small house and knocked.  He had hardly done so when\nthe poor man opened the little door and bade the traveler\ncome in.  Pass the night with me, it is already dark, said he.\nYou cannot go any further to-night.  This pleased the Lord,\nand he went in.  The poor man's wife shook hands with him,\nand welcomed him, and said he\nwas to make himself at home and put up with what they had got.\nThey had not much to offer him, but what they had they would\ngive him with all their hearts.  Then she put the potatoes on\nthe fire, and while they were boiling, she milked the goat,\nthat they might have a little milk with them.  When the\ncloth was laid, the Lord sat down with the man and his wife,\nand he enjoyed their coarse food, for there were happy faces\nat the table.  When they had had supper and it was bed-time,\nthe woman called her husband apart and said, listen, dear\nhusband, let us make up a bed of straw for ourselves to-night,\nand then the poor traveler can sleep in our bed and have a\ngood rest, for he has been walking the whole day through,\nand that makes one weary.  With all my heart, he answered,\nI will go and offer it to him.  And he went to the stranger\nand invited him, if he had no objection, to sleep in their\nbed and rest his limbs properly.  But the Lord was unwilling\nto take their bed from the two old folks.  However, they\nwould not be satisfied, until at length he did it and lay\ndown in their bed, while they themselves lay on some straw\non the ground.\nNext morning they got up before daybreak, and made as good a\nbreakfast as they could for the guest.  When the sun shone in\nthrough the little window, and the Lord had got up, he again\nate with them, and then prepared to set out on his journey.\nBut as he was standing at the door he turned round and said,\nas you are so kind and good, you may wish three things for\nyourselves and I will grant them.  Then the man said, what\nelse should I wish for but eternal happiness, and that we\ntwo, as long as we live, may be healthy and have every day\nour daily bread.  For the third wish, I do not know what to\nhave.  And the Lord said to him, will you wish for a new\nhouse instead of this old one.  Oh, yes, said the man.\nIf I can have that, too, I should like it very much.  And\nthe Lord fulfilled his wish, and changed their old house\ninto a new one, again gave them his blessing, and went on.\nThe sun was high when the rich man got up and leaned out\nof his window and saw, on the opposite side of the way, a\nnew clean-looking\nhouse with red tiles and bright windows where the old hut\nused to be.  He was very much astonished, and called his\nwife and said to her, tell me, what can have happened.\nLast night there was a miserable little hut standing there,\nand to-day there is a beautiful new house.  Run over and see\nhow that has come to pass.\nSo his wife went and asked the poor man, and he said to her,\nyesterday evening a traveler came here and asked for a\nnight's lodging, and this morning when he took leave of\nus he granted us three wishes - eternal happiness, health\nduring this life and our daily bread as well, and\nbesides this, a beautiful new house instead of our old\nhut.\nWhen the rich man's wife heard this, she ran back in haste\nand told her husband how it had happened.  The man said,\nI could tear myself to pieces.  If I had but known that.\nThat traveler came to our house too, and wanted to sleep\nhere, and I sent him away.  Quick, said his wife, get on\nyour horse.  You can still catch the man up, and then you must\nask to have three wishes granted to you also.\nThe rich man followed the good counsel and galloped away on\nhis horse, and soon came up with the Lord.  He spoke to him\nsoftly and pleasantly, and begged him not to take it\namiss that he had not let him in directly.  He was looking\nfor the front-door key, and in the meantime the stranger had\ngone away.  If he returned the same way he must come and\nstay with him.  Yes, said the Lord.  If I ever come back\nagain, I will do so.  Then the rich man asked if might not\nwish for three things too, as his neighbor had done.\nYes, said the Lord, he might, but it would not be to his\nadvantage, and he had better not wish for anything.  But\nthe rich man thought that he could easily ask for something\nwhich would add to his happiness, if he only knew that it would\nbe granted.  So the Lord said to him, ride home, then, and\nthree wishes which you shall make, shall be fulfilled.\nThe rich man had now gained what he wanted, so he rode home,\nand began to consider what he should wish for.  As he\nwas thus\nthinking he let the bridle fall, and the horse began to caper\nabout, so that he was continually disturbed in his meditations,\nand could not collect his thoughts at all.  He patted its neck,\nand said, gently, lisa, but the horse only began new tricks.\nThen at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently, I wish\nyour neck was broken.  Directly he had said the words, down the\nhorse fell on the ground, and there it lay dead and never\nmoved again.  And thus was his first wish fulfilled.  As he\nwas miserly by nature, he did not like to leave the harness\nlying there.  So he cut it off, and put it on his back.  And\nnow he had to go on foot.  I have still two wishes left, said\nhe, and comforted himself with that thought.\nAnd now as he was walking slowly through the sand, and the\nsun was burning hot at noon-day, he grew quite bad-tempered\nand angry.  The saddle hurt his back, and he had not yet any\nidea what to wish for.  If I were to wish for all the riches\nand treasures in the world, said he to himself, I should still\nto think of all kinds of other things later on.  I know that,\nbeforehand.  But I will manage so that there is nothing at all\nleft me to wish for afterwards.  Then he sighed and said, ah,\nif I were but that bavarian peasant, who likewise had three\nwishes granted to him, and knew quite well what to do, and\nin the first place wished for a great deal of beer, and in\nthe second for as much beer as he was able to drink, and in\nthe third for a barrel of beer into the bargain.\nMany a time he thought he had found it, but then it seemed to\nhim to be, after all, too little.  Then it came into his\nmind, what an easy life his wife had, for she stayed at\nhome in a cool room and enjoyed herself.  This really did vex\nhim, and before he was aware, he said, I just wish she was\nsitting there on this saddle, and could not get off it,\ninstead of my having to drag it along on my back.  And as the\nlast word was spoken, the saddle disappeared from his back,\nand he saw that his second wish had been fulfilled.  Then\nhe really did feel hot.  He began to run and wanted to be quite\nalone in his own room at home, to think of something really\nbig for his last wish.  But when he arrived there and opened\nthe parlor-door, he\nsaw his wife sitting in the middle of the room on the saddle,\ncrying and complaining, and quite unable to get off it.  So\nhe said, do bear it, and I will wish for all the riches on\nearth for you, only stay where you are.  She, however, called\nhim a fool, and said, what good will all the riches on earth\ndo me, if I am to sit on this saddle.  You have wished me\non it, so you must help me off.  So whether he would or not,\nhe was forced to let his third wish be that she should be\nquit of the saddle, and able to get off it, and immediately\nthe wish was fulfilled.  So he got nothing by it but vexation,\ntrouble, abuse, and the loss of his horse.  But the poor\npeople lived contentedly, quietly, and piously until their\nhappy death.\n", "Old Hildebrand": "Once upon a time lived a peasant and his wife, and the parson\nof the village had a fancy for the wife, and had wished for\na long while to spend a whole day happily with her.  The\npeasant woman, too, was quite willing.  One day, therefore, he\nsaid to the woman, listen, my dear friend, I have now thought of\na way by which we can for once spend a whole day happily together.\nI'll tell you what.  On wednesday, you must take to your bed, and\ntell your husband you are ill, and as long as you complain and\nact being ill properly, and go on doing so until sunday when I\nhave to preach, I will then say in my sermon that whosoever has\nat home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father,\na sick mother, a sick brother or whosoever else it may be,\nand makes a pilgrimage to the gockerli hill in italy, where\nyou can get a peck of laurel-leaves for a kreuzer, the sick child,\nthe sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, or sick mother,\nthe sick sister, or whosoever else it may be, will be restored\nto health immediately.\nI will manage it, said the woman promptly.  On the wednesday,\ntherefore, the peasant woman took to her bed, and complained and\nlamented as agreed on, and her husband did everything for\nher that he could think of, but nothing did her any good, and when\nsunday came the woman said, I feel as ill as if I were going to\ndie at once, but there is one thing I should like to do before\nmy end - I should like to hear the parson's sermon that he is\ngoing to preach to-day.  On that the peasant said, ah, my child,\ndo not do it - you might make yourself worse if you were to get\nup.  Look, I will hear the sermon, and will attend to it very\ncarefully, and will tell you everything the parson says.\nWell, said the woman, go, then, and pay great attention, and\nrepeat to me all that you hear.  So the peasant heard the sermon,\nand the parson said, if any one had at home a sick child, a sick\nhusband, a sick wife, a sick father a sick mother, a sick sister,\nbrother or any one else, and would make a pilgimage to the\ngockerli hill in italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a\nkreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father,\nsick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it might\nbe, would be restored to health instantly, and whosoever wished\nto undertake the journey was to go to him after the service was\nover, and he would give him the sack for the laurel-leaves and\nthe kreuzer.  Then no one was more rejoiced than the peasant,\nand after the service was over, he went at once to the parson,\nwho gave him the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer.\nAfter that he went home, and even at the house door he cried,\nhurrah.  Dear wife, it is now almost the same thing as if you were\nwell.  The parson has preached to-day that whosoever had at home\na sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick\nmother, a sick sister, brother or whoever it might be, and would\nmake a pilgrimage to the gockerli hill in italy, where a peck\nof laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband,\nsick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or\nwhosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and now I\nhave already got the bag and the kreuzer from the parson, and\nwill at once begin my journey so that you may get well the faster,\nand thereupon he went away.  He was hardly gone however before\nthe woman got up, and the parson was there immediately.\nBut now we will leave these two for a while, and follow the\npeasant, who walked on quickly without stopping, in order to\nget the sooner to the gockerli hill, and on his way he met his\ngossip.  His gossip was an egg-merchant, and was just coming\nfrom the market, where he had sold his eggs.  May you be blessed,\nsaid the gossip, where are you off to so fast.\nTo all eternity, my friend, said the peasant, my wife is ill,\nand I have been to-day to hear the parson's sermon, and he\npreached that if any one had in his house a sick child, a sick\nhusband, a sick\nwife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any\none else, and made a pilgrimage to the gockerli hill in italy,\nwhere a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, the\nsick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, the sick mother,\nthe sick sister, brother or whosoever else it was, would be\ncured immediately, and so I have got the bag for the laurel-leaves\nand the kreuzer from the parson, and now I am beginning my\npilgrimage.  But listen, gossip, said the egg-merchant to the\npeasant, are you, then, stupid enough to believe such a thing\nas that.  Don't you know what it means.  The parson wants to\nspend a whole day alone with your wife in peace, so he has given\nyou this job to do to get you out of the way.\nMy word, said the peasant.  How I'd like to know if that's true.\nCome, then, said the gossip, I'll tell you what to do.  Get\ninto my egg-basket and I will carry you home, and then you will\nsee for yourself.  So that was settled, and the gossip put the\npeasant into his egg-basket and carried him home.\nWhen they got to the house, hurrah.  Everything was already\nvery merry there.  The woman had already had nearly everything\nkilled that was in the farmyard, and had made pancakes, and the\nparson was there, and had brought his fiddle with him.  The\ngossip knocked at the door, and woman asked who was there.  It\nis I, gossip, said the egg-merchant, give me shelter this night.\nI have not sold my eggs at the market, so now I have to carry\nthem home again, and they are so heavy that I shall never be able\nto do it, for it is dark already.\nIndeed, my friend, said the woman, you come at a very inconvenient\ntime for me, but as you are here it can't be helped.  Come in,\nand take a seat there on the bench by the stove.  Then she\nplaced the gossip and the basket which he carried on his back on\nthe bench by the stove.  The parson and the woman, however, were\nas merry as could be.  At length the parson said, listen, my\ndear friend, you can sing beautifully.  Sing something to me.\nOh, said the woman,\nI cannot sing now.  In my young days indeed I could sing well\nenough, but that's all over now.\nCome, said the parson once more, do sing some little song.\nOn that the woman began and sang,\n          I've sent my husband away from me\n          to the gockerli hill in italy.\nThereupon the parson sang,\n          I wish 'twas a year before he came back,\n          I'd never ask him for the laurel-leaf sack.\n          Hallelujah.\nThen the gossip who was in the background began to sing -\nbut I ought to tell you the peasant was called hildebrand -\nso the gossip sang,\n          what are you doing, my hildebrand dear,\n          there on the bench by the stove so near.\n          Hallelujah.\nAnd then the peasant sang from his basket,\n          all singing I ever shall hate from this day,\n          and here in this basket no longer I'll stay.\n          Hallelujah.\nAnd he climbed out of the basket, and flogged the parson\nout of the house.\n", "The Jew Among Thorns": "There was once a rich man, who had a servant who served him\ndiligently and honestly.  He was every morning the first out of\nbed, and the last to go to rest at night, and whenever there was\na difficult job to be done, which nobody cared to undertake, he\nwas always the first to set himself to it.  Moreover, he never\ncomplained, but was contented with everything and always merry.\nWhen a year was ended, his master gave him no wages, for he said\nto himself, that is the cleverest way, for I shall save something\nand he will not go away, but stay quietly in my service.  The\nservant said nothing, but did his work the second year as he had\ndone it the first, and when at the end of this, likewise, he\nreceived no wages, he submitted and still stayed on.\nWhen the third year also was past, the master considered, put his\nhand in his pocket, but pulled nothing out.  Then at last the\nservant said, master, for three years I have served you honestly,\nbe so good as to give me what I ought to have, for I wish to\nleave, and look about me a little more in the world.\nYes, my good fellow, answered the old miser, you have served me\nindustriously, and therefore you shall be graciously rewarded.\nAnd he put his hand into his pocket, but counted out only three\nfarthings, saying, there, you have a farthing for each year, that\nis large and liberal pay, such as you would have received from\nfew masters.\nThe honest servant, who understood little about money, put his\nfortune into his pocket, and thought, ah, now that I have my\npurse full, why need I trouble and plague myself any longer with\nhard work.  So on he went, up hill and down dale, and sang and\njumped to his heart's content.  Now it came to pass that as he\nwas going by a thicket a little man stepped out, and called to\nhim, whither away, merry brother.  I see you do not carry many\ncares.  Why should I be sad, answered the servant, I have enough.\nThree years, wages are jingling in my pocket.\nHow much is your treasure, the dwarf asked him.  How much.  Three\nfarthings sterling, all told.  Look here, said the dwarf, I am a\npoor needy man, give me your three farthings, I can work no longer\nbut you are young, and can easily earn your bread.\nAnd as the servant had a good heart, and felt pity for the little\nman, he gave him the three farthings, saying, take them in the\nname of heaven, I shall not be any the worse for it.\nThen the little man said, as I see you have a good heart I grant\nyou three wishes, one for each farthing, they shall all be\nfulfilled.  Aha, said the servant, you are one of those who can\nwork wonders.  Well, then, if it is to be so, I wish, first, for\na gun, which shall hit everything that I aim at, secondly, for a\nfiddle, which when\nI play on it, shall compel all who hear it to dance, thirdly, that\nif I ask a favor of any one he shall not be able to refuse it.\nAll that shall you have, said the dwarf, and put his hand into the\nbush, and just imagine, there lay a fiddle and gun, all ready,\njust as if they had been ordered.  These he gave to the servant,\nand then said to him, whatever you may ask at any time, no man in\nthe world shall be able to deny you.\nHeart alive.  What more can one desire, said the servant, to\nhimself, and went merrily onwards.  Soon afterwards he met a Jew\nwith a long goat's beard, who was standing listening to the song\nof a bird which was sitting up at the top of a tree.  Good\nheavens, he was exclaiming, that such a small creature should have\nsuch a fearfully loud voice.  If it were but mine.  If only\nsomeone would sprinkle some salt upon its tail.  If that is all,\nsaid the servant, the bird shall soon be down here.  And taking\naim he blew, and down fell the bird into the thorn-bushes.  Go,\nyou rogue, he said to the Jew, and fetch the bird out for\nyourself.\nOh, said the Jew, leave out the rogue, my master, and I will do it\nat once.  I will get the bird out for myself, now that you have\nhit it.  Then he lay down on the ground, and began to crawl\ninto the thicket.\nWhen he was fast among the thorns, the good servant's humor\nso tempted him that he took up his fiddle and began to play.  In a\nmoment the Jew's legs began to move, and to jump into the air, and\nthe more the servant fiddled the better went the dance.  But the\nthorns tore his shabby coat from him, combed his beard, and\npricked and plucked him all over the body.  Oh, dear, cried the\nJew, what do I want with your fiddling.  Leave the fiddle alone\nmaster, I do not want to dance.\nBut the servant did not listen to him, and thought, you have\nfleeced people often enough, now the thorn-bushes shall do the\nsame to you.  And he began to play over again, so that the Jew\nhad to jump higher than ever, and scraps of his coat were left\nhanging on the thorns.  Oh, woe's me, cried the Jew, I will give\nthe gentleman whatsoever he asks if only he leaves off fiddling,\na whole purseful of gold.  If you are so liberal, said the servant,\nI will stop my music, but this I must say to your credit, that\nyou dance to it so well that one must really admire it.  And\nhaving taken the purse he went his way.\nThe Jew stood still and watched the servant quietly until he was\nfar off and out of sight, and then he screamed out with all his\nmight, you miserable musician, you beer-house fiddler.  Wait till\nI catch you alone, I will hunt you till the soles of your shoes\nfall off.  You ragamuffin, just put six farthings in your mouth,\nthat you may be worth three halfpence.  And went on abusing him as\nfast as he could speak.  As soon as he had refreshed himself a\nlittle in this way, and got his breath again, he ran into the town\nto the justice.\nMy lord judge, he said, I have come to make a complaint, see how\na rascal has robbed and ill-treated me on the public highway.  A\nstone on the ground might pity me, my clothes all torn, my body\npricked and scratched, my little all gone with my purse - good\nducats, each piece better than the last, for God's sake let the\nman be thrown into prison.\nWas it a soldier, said the judge, who cut you thus with his\nsabre.  Nothing of the sort, said the Jew, it was no sword that he\nhad, but a gun hanging at his back, and a fiddle at his neck, the\nwretch may easily be recognized.\nSo the judge sent his people out after the man, and they found the\ngood servant, who had been going quite slowly along, and they\nfound, too, the purse with the money upon him.  As soon as he\nwas taken before the judge he said, I did not touch the Jew, nor\ntake his money, he gave it to me of his own free will, that I\nmight leave off fiddling because he could not bear my music.\nHeaven defend us, cried the Jew, his lies are as thick as flies\nupon the wall.\nBut the judge also did not believe his tale, and said, this is\na bad defence, no Jew would do that.  And because he had committed\nrobbery on the public highway, he sentenced the good servant to be\nhanged.  As he was being led away the Jew again screamed after\nhim, you vagabond.  You dog of a fiddler.  Now you are going to\nreceive your well-earned reward.  The servant walked quietly with\nthe hangman up the ladder, but upon the last step he turned round\nand said to the judge, grant me just one request before I die.\nYes, if you do not ask your life, said the judge.\nI do not ask for life, answered the servant, but as a last favor\nlet me play once more upon my fiddle.\nThe Jew raised a great cry of, murder.  Murder.  For goodness,\nsake do not allow it.  Do not allow it.  But the judge said, why\nshould I not let him have this short pleasure.  It has been\ngranted to him, and he shall have it.  However, he could not have\nrefused on account of the gift which had been bestowed on the\nservant.\nThen the Jew cried, oh.  Woe's me.  Tie me, tie me fast.  While\nthe good servant took his fiddle from his neck, and made ready.\nAs he gave the first scrape, they all began to quiver and shake,\nthe judge, his clerk, and the hangman and his men, and the cord\nfell out of the hand of the one who was going to tie the Jew\nfast.  At the second scrape they all leaped up and began to\ndance, the judge and the Jew being the best at jumping.  Soon all\nwho had gathered in the market-place out of curiosity were dancing\nwith them, old and young, fat and lean, one with another.  The\ndogs, likewise, which had run there, got up on their hind legs\nand capered about, and the longer he played, the higher sprang\nthe dancers, so that they knocked against each other's heads\nand began to shriek terribly.\nAt length the judge cried, quite of breath, I will give you your\nlife if you will only stop fiddling.  The good servant thereupon\nhad compassion, took his fiddle and hung it round his neck again,\nand stepped down the ladder.  Then he went up to the Jew, who was\nlying upon the ground panting for breath, and said, you rascal,\nnow confess, whence you got the money, or I will take my fiddle\nand begin to play again.  I stole it, I stole it, cried he, but\nyou have honestly earned it.  So the judge had the Jew taken\nto the gallows and hanged as a thief.\n", "The Flail From Heaven": "A countryman was once going out to plough with a pair of oxen.\nWhen he got to the field, both the animals, horns began to grow,\nand went on growing, and when he wanted to go home they were so\nbig that the oxen could not get through the gateway.  By good\nluck a butcher came by just then, and he delivered them over to\nhim, and made the bargain in this way, that he should bring the\nbutcher a peck of rape-seed, and then the butcher was to count him\nout a brabant taler for every seed.  I call that well sold.  The\npeasant now went home, and carried the peck of rape-seed to him on\nhis back.  On the way, however, he lost one seed out of the bag.\nThe butcher paid him justly as agreed on, and if the peasant had\nnot lost the seed, he would have had one taler more.  By the time\nhe returned, the seed had grown into a tree which reached up to\nthe sky.  Then thought the peasant, as you have the chance,\nyou must just see what the angels are doing up there above.  So\nhe climbed up, and saw that the angels above were threshing oats,\nand he looked on.  While he was thus watching them, he observed\nthat the tree on which he was standing, was beginning to totter.\nHe peeped down, and saw that someone was just going to cut it\ndown.  If I were to fall down from hence\nit would be a bad thing, thought he, and in his extremity he did\nnot know how to save himself better than by taking the chaff of the\noats which lay there in heaps, and twisting a rope of it.  He\nlikewise snatched a hoe and a flail which were lying about in\nheaven, and let himself down by the rope.  But he came down on\nthe earth exactly in the middle of a deep, deep hole.  So it was\na real stroke of luck that he had brought the hoe, for he hoed\nhimself a flight of steps with it, and mounted up, and took the\nflail with him as a token of his truth, so that no one could have\nany doubt of his story.\n", "The Three Army-Surgeons": "Three army surgeons who thought they knew their art perfectly\nwere traveling about the world, and they came to an inn where\nthey wanted to pass the night.  The host asked whence they came,\nand whither they were going.  We are roaming about the world and\npractising our art.  Show me just once what you can do, said\nthe host.  Then the first said he would cut off his hand, and put\nit on again early next morning.  The second said he would tear\nout his heart, and replace it next morning.  The third said he would\ngouge out his eyes and heal them again next morning.  If you can\ndo that, said the innkeeper, you have learnt everything.  They,\nhowever, had a salve, with which they rubbed themselves, which\njoined parts together, and they constantly carried with them the\nlittle bottle in which it was.  Then they cut the hand, heart\nand eyes from their bodies as they had said they would, and laid\nthem all together on a plate, and gave it to the innkeeper.\nThe innkeeper gave it to a servant-girl who was to set it in the\ncupboard, and take good care of it.  Secretly, however, the girl\nhad a lover, who was a soldier.  When therefore the innkeeper,\nthe three army surgeons, and everyone else in the house were asleep,\nthe soldier came and wanted something to eat.  The girl opened\nthe cupboard and brought him some food, and in her love forgot\nto shut the cupboard-door again.  She seated herself at the table\nby her lover, and they chatted away together.  While she sat so\ncontentedly there, thinking of no ill luck, the cat came creeping\nin, found the cupboard open, took the hand and heart and eyes of\nthe three army surgeons, and ran off with them.  When the soldier\nhad done eating, and the girl was taking away the things and\ngoing to shut the cupboard, she saw that the plate which the\ninnkeeper had given her to take care of, was empty.  Then she\nsaid in a fright to her lover, ah, miserable girl, what shall I\ndo.  The hand is gone, the heart and the eyes are gone too, what\nwill become of me in the morning.  Be easy, said he, I will\nhelp you out of your trouble.  There is a thief hanging outside\non the gallows, I will cut off his hand.  Which hand was it.\nThe right one.  Then the girl gave him a sharp knife, and he went\nand cut the poor sinner's right hand off, and brought it to her.\nAfter this he caught the cat and gouged its eyes out, and now\nnothing but the heart was missing.  Have you not been slaughtering,\nand are not the dead pigs in the cellar, said he.  Yes, said the\ngirl.  That's fine, said the soldier, and he went down and fetched\na pig's heart.  The girl placed all together on the plate, and\nput it in the cupboard, and when after this her lover took leave\nof her, she went quietly to bed.\nIn the morning when the three army surgeons got up, they told\nthe girl she was to bring them the plate on which the\nhand, heart, and eyes were lying.  Then she brought it out of\nthe cupboard, and the first fixed the thief's hand on and smeared\nit with his salve, and it promptly grew to his arm.  The second\ntook the cat's eyes and put them in his own head.  The third\nfixed the pig's heart firm in the place where his own had been,\nand the innkeeper stood by, admired their skill, and said he\nhad never yet seen such a thing as\nthat done, and would sing their praises and recommend them to\neveryone.  Then they paid their bill, and traveled further.\nAs they were on their way, the one with the pig's heart did not\nstay with them at all, but wherever there was a corner he ran\nto it, and rooted about in it with his nose as pigs do.  The\nothers wanted to hold him back by the tail of his coat, but that\ndid no good.  He tore himself loose, and ran wherever the dirt was\ndeepest.  The second also behaved very strangely.  He rubbed\nhis eyes, and said to the others, comrades, what has happened.\nThese are not my eyes.  I don't see at all.  Will one of you lead\nme, so that I do not fall.  Then with difficulty they traveled on\ntill evening, when they reached another inn.  They went into the\nbar together, and there at a table in the corner sat a rich man\ncounting money.  The one with the thief's hand walked round\nabout him, made a few jerky movements with his arm, and at\nlast when the stranger turned away, snatched at the pile of money,\nand took a handful from it.  One of them saw this, and\nsaid, comrade, what are you about.  You must not steal, shame\non you.  Eh, said he, but what can I do.  My hand twitches, and\nI am forced to snatch things whether I will or not.\nAfter this, they lay down to sleep, and while they were lying\nthere it was so dark that no one could see his own hand.  All\nat once the one with the cat's eyes awoke, aroused the others,\nand said, brothers, just look up, do you see the white mice\nrunning about there.  The two sat up, but could see nothing.  Then\nsaid he, things are not right with us, we have not got back\nagain what is ours.  We must return to the innkeeper, he has\ndeceived us.  So they went back the next morning, and told the\nhost they had not received what was their own, that the first\nhad a thief's hand, the second cat's eyes, and the third a\npig's heart.  The innkeeper said that the girl must be to blame\nfor that, and was going to call her, but when she had seen the\nthree coming, she had run out by the backdoor, and not come back.\nThen the three said he must give them a great deal of money, or\nthey would set the red cock on his roof. - The symbol of a red\ncock for fire is of remote antiquity. - He gave them what he\nhad, and whatever he could raise, and the three went away\nwith it.  It was enough for the rest of their lives, but they\nwould rather have had their own rightful organs.\n", "The Seven Swabians": "Seven swabians were once together.  The first was master\nschulz, the second, jackli, the third, marli, the fourth,\njergli, the fifth, michal, the sixth, Hans, the seventh,\nveitli.  All seven had made up their minds to travel\nabout the world to seek adventures and perform great\ndeeds.  But in order that they might go in safety and with\narms in their hands, they thought it would be advisable\nthat they should have one solitary, but very strong,\nand very long spear made for them.  This spear all seven of\nthem took in their hands at once.  In front walked the\nboldest and bravest,\nand that was master schulz.  All the others followed in a\nrow, and veitli was the last.  Then it came to pass one\nday in the hay month, when they had walked a long distance,\nand still had a long way to go before they reached the\nvillage where they were to pass the night, that as they\nwere in a meadow in the twilight a great beetle or hornet\nflew by them from behind a bush, and hummed in a menacing\nmanner.  Master schulz was so terrified that he all but dropped\nthe spear, and a cold sweat broke out over his whole body.\nHark, hark, cried he to his comrades, good heavens.  I hear a\ndrum.  Jackli, who was behind him holding the spear, and into\nwhose nose some smell had risen, said, something is most\ncertainly going on, for I smell the powder and the match.  At\nthese words master schulz began to take to flight, and in a\ntrice jumped\nover a hedge, but as he just happened to jump on to the teeth of\na rake which had been left lying there after the hay-making, the\nhandle of it struck against his face and gave him a tremendous\nblow.  O dear.  O dear, screamed master schulz.  Take me\nprisoner, I surrender, I surrender.  The other six all leapt\nover, one on the top of the other, crying, if you surrender, I\nsurrender too.  If you surrender, I surrender too.  At length,\nas no enemy was there to bind and take them away, they saw that\nthey had been mistaken, and in order that the story might not\nbe known, and they be treated as fools and ridiculed, they\nall swore to each other to hold their peace about it until one\nof them should speak of it by mistake.\nThen they journeyed onwards.  The second danger which they\nsurvived cannot be compared with the first.  Some days afterwards,\ntheir path led them through a fallow-field where a hare was sitting\nsleeping in the sun.  Her ears were standing straight up, and her\ngreat glassy eyes were wide open.  All of them were alarmed at\nthe sight of the horrible wild beast, and they consulted together\nas to what it would be the least dangerous to do.  For if they\nwere to run away, they knew that the monster would pursue and\nswallow them whole.  So they said, we must go through a great\nand dangerous struggle.  Boldly ventured, is half won, and all\nseven grasped the spear, master schulz in front, and veitli\nbehind.  Master schulz was always trying to keep the spear\nback, but veitli had become quite brave while behind, and wanted\nto dash forward and cried,\n          strike home, in every swabian's name,\n          or else I wish you may be lame.\nBut Hans knew how to meet this, and said,\n          thunder and lightning, it's fine to prate,\n          but for dragon-hunting you are always late.\nMichal cried,\n          nothing is missing, not even a hair,\n          be sure the devil himself is there.\nThen it was jergli's turn, and he said,\n          if it be not he, it's at least his mother,\n          or else the devil's own step-brother.\nAnd now marli had a bright thought, and said to veitli,\n          advance, veitli, advance, advance,\n          and I behind will hold the lance.\nVeitli, however, did not obey, and jackli said,\n          tis schulz's place the first to be,\n          no one deserves that honor but he.\nThen master schulz plucked up his courage, and said, gravely,\n          then let us boldly advance to the fight,\n          thus we shall show our valor and might.\nHereupon they all together set on the dragon.  Master\nschulz crossed himself and prayed for God's assistance, but\nas all this was of no avail, and he was getting nearer and nearer\nto the enemy, he screamed, oho, oho, ho, ho, ho, in the greatest\nanguish.  This awakened the hare, which in great alarm darted\nswiftly away.  When master schulz saw her thus flying from the\nfield of battle, he cried in his joy,\n          quick, veitli, quick, look there, look there,\n          the monster's nothing but a hare.\nBut the swabian allies went in search of further adventures, and\ncame to the moselle, a mossy, quiet, deep river, over which there are\nfew bridges, and which in many places people have to cross in\nboats.  As the seven swabians did not know this, they called\nto a man who was working on the opposite side of the river, to\nknow how people contrived to get across.  The distance and their\nway of speaking made the man unable to understand what they\nwanted, and he said, what, what, in the way people speak in\nthe neighborhood of treves.  Master schulz thought he was saying,\nwade, wade through the water, and as he was the first, began\nto set out and\nwent into the moselle.  It was not long before he sank in the\nmud and the deep waves which drove against him, but his hat was\nblown on the opposite shore by the wind, and a frog sat down\nbeside it, and croaked, wat, wat, wat.  The other six on the\nopposite side heard that, and said, oho, comrades, master\nschulz is calling us.  If he can wade across, why cannot we.\nSo they all jumped into the water together in a great hurry, and\nwere drowned, and thus one frog took the lives of all six of\nthem, and not one of the swabian allies ever reached home again.\n", "The Three Apprentices": "There were once three apprentices, who had agreed to keep always\ntogether while traveling, and always to work in the same\ntown.  At one time, however, their masters had no more work\nto give them, so that at last they were in rags, and had nothing\nto live on.  Then one of them said, what shall we do.  We cannot\nstay here any longer, we will travel once more, and if we do\nnot find any work in the town we go to, we will arrange with\nthe innkeeper there, that we are to write and tell him where we\nare staying, so that we can always have news of each other, and\nthen we will separate.  And that seemed best to the others also.\nThey went forth, and met on the way a richly-dressed man who\nasked who they were.  We are apprentices looking for work.  Up to\nthis time we have kept together, but if we cannot find anything\nto do we are going to separate.  There is no need for that, said\nthe man, if you will do what I tell you, you shall not want for\ngold or for work.  Nay, you shall become great lords, and drive\nin your carriages.  One of them said, if our souls and salvation\nbe not endangered, we will certainly do it.  They will not,\nreplied the man,\nI have no claim on you.  One of the others, however, had looked\nat his feet, and when he saw a horse's foot and a man's foot,\nhe did not want to have anything to do with him.  Then the\ndevil said, be easy, I have no designs on you, but on another\nsoul, which is half my own already, and whose measure shall\nbut run full.  As they were now secure, they consented, and the\ndevil told them what he wanted.  The first was to answer,\nall three of us, to every question.  The second was to say,\nfor money, and the third, and quite right too.  They were always\nto say this, one after the other, but they were not to say one\nword more, and if they disobeyed this order, all their money would\ndisappear at once, but so long as they observed it, their pockets\nwould always be full.  As a beginning, he at once gave them as\nmuch as they could carry, and told them to go to such and such\nan inn when they got to the town.  They went to it, and the\ninnkeeper came to meet them, and asked if they wished for\nanything to eat.  The first replied, all three of us.  Yes,\nsaid the host, that is what I mean.  The second said, for money.\nOf course, said the host.  The third said, and quite right too.\nCertainly it is right, said the host.\nGood meat and drink were now brought to them, and they were well\nwaited on.  After the dinner came the payment, and the innkeeper\ngave the bill to the one who said, all three of us, the second\nsaid, for money, and the third, and quite right too.  Indeed\nit is right, said the host, all three pay, and without money I\ncan give nothing.  They, however, paid even more than he had\nasked.  The lodgers, who were looking on, said, these people must\nbe mad.  Yes, indeed they are, said the host, they are not very\nwise.  So they stayed some time in the inn, and said nothing else\nbut, all three of us, for money, and and quite right too.  But\nthey saw and knew all that was going on.  It so happened that a\ngreat merchant came with a large sum of money, and said, sir\nhost, take care of my money for me, here are three crazy apprentices\nwho might steal it from me.  The host did as he was asked.  As\nhe was carrying the trunk into his room, he felt that it was\nheavy with gold.  Thereupon he gave the three apprentices a\nlodging below, but the merchant received a separate apartment\nupstairs.  When it was midnight, and the host thought that all\nwere asleep, he came with his wife, and they had an axe and\nstruck the rich merchant dead.   And after they had murdered\nhim they went to bed again.  When it was day there was a great\noutcry.  The merchant lay dead in bed bathed in blood.  All\nthe guests came running out, but the host said, the three\ncrazy apprentices have done this.  The lodgers confirmed it,\nand said, it can have been no one else.  The innkeeper, however,\nhad them called, and said to them, have you killed the merchant.\nAll three of us, said the first.  For money, said the second.\nAnd the third added, and quite right too.  There now, you hear,\nsaid the host, they confess it themselves.  They were taken to\nprison, therefore, and were to be tried.  When they saw that\nthings were going so seriously, they were after all afraid,\nbut at night the devil came and said, bear it just one day\nlonger, and do not spurn your luck, not one hair of your head\nshall be hurt.\nThe next morning they were led to the bar, and the judge said,\nare you the murderers.  All three of us.  Why did you kill the\nmerchant.  For money.  You wicked wretches, you have no\nhorror of your sins.  And quite right too.  They have confessed,\nand are still stubborn, said the judge, lead them to death\ninstantly.  So they were taken out, and the host had to go with\nthem into the circle.  When they were taken hold of by the\nexecutioner's men, and were just going to be led up to the\nscaffold where the hangman was standing with naked sword,\na coach drawn by four chestnut horses came up suddenly, driving\nso fast that fire flashed from the stones, and someone made\nsigns from the window with a\nwhite handkerchief.  Then said the hangman, it is a pardon\ncoming, and pardon, pardon, was called from the carriage also.\nThen the devil stepped out as a very noble gentleman,\nbeautifully dressed, and said, you three are innocent.  You\nmay now speak, make known what you have seen and heard.  Then\nsaid the eldest, we did not kill the merchant, the murderer\nis standing there in the circle, and he pointed to the innkeeper.\nIn proof of this, go into his cellar, where many others whom he\nhas killed are still hanging.  Then the judge sent the\nexecutioner's men thither, and they found it was as the\napprentices said, and when they had informed the judge of this,\nhe caused the innkeeper to be led up, and his head was cut off.\nThen said the devil to the three, now I have got the soul which\nI wanted to have, and you are free, and have money for the\nrest of your lives.\n", "The Lazy Spinner": "In a certain village there once lived a man and his wife, and\nthe wife was so lazy that she would never work at anything.\nWhatever her husband gave her to spin, she did not get done,\nand what she did spin she did not wind, but let it all remain\nentangled in a heap.  If the man scolded her, she was always\nready with her tongue, and said, well, how should I wind it,\nwhen I have no reel.  Just you go into the forest and get me\none.  If that is all, said the man, then I will go into the\nforest, and get some wood for making reels.  Then the woman\nwas afraid that if he had the wood he would make her a reel\nof it, and she would have to wind her yarn\noff, and then begin to spin again.  She bethought herself a\nlittle, and then a lucky idea occurred to her, and she\nsecretly followed the man into the forest, and when he had\nclimbed into a tree to choose and cut the wood, she crept\ninto the thicket below where he could not see her, and cried,\n     he who cuts wood for reels shall die,\n     and he who winds, shall perish.\nThe man listened, laid down his axe for a moment, and began\nto consider what that could mean.  Well, he said at last,\nwhat can that have been, my ears must have been singing, I\nwon't alarm myself for nothing.  So he once more seized the\naxe, and began to hew.  Then again there came a cry from\nbelow,\n     he who cuts wood for reels shall die,\n     and he who winds, shall perish.\nHe stopped, and felt afraid and alarmed, and pondered over\nthe circumstance.  But when a few moments had passed, he took\nheart again, and a third time he stretched out his hand for\nthe axe, and began to cut.  But someone called out a third\ntime, and said loudly,\n     he who cuts wood for reels shall die,\n     and he who winds, shall perish.\nThat was enough for him, and all inclination had departed\nfrom him, so he hastily descended the tree, and set out on\nhis way home.  The woman ran as fast as she could by byways\nso as to get home\nfirst.  So when he entered the parlor, she put on an\ninnocent look as if nothing had happened, and said, well,\nhave you brought a nice piece of wood for reels.  No, said he,\nI see very well that winding won't do, and told her what had\nhappened to him in the forest, and from that time forth left\nher in peace about it.  Neverthless after some time, the man\nagain began to complain of the disorder in the house.  Wife,\nsaid he, it is really a shame that the spun yarn should lie\nthere all entangled.  I'll tell you what, said she, as we\nstill don't come by any reel, go you up into the loft, and I\nwill stand down below, and will throw the yarn up to you,\nand you will throw it down to me, and so we shall get a\nskein after all.  Yes, that will do, said the man.  So they\ndid that, and when it was done, he said, the yarn is in\nskeins, now it must be boiled.  The woman was again\ndistressed, and said, yes, we will boil it to-morrow morning\nearly.  But she was secretly contriving another trick.\nEarly in the morning she got up, lighted a fire, and put the\nkettle on, only instead of the yarn, she put in a lump of tow\nand let it boil.  After that she went to the man who was\nstill lying in bed, and said to him, I must just go out, you\nmust get up and look after the yarn which is in the kettle on\nthe fire, but you must be at hand at once, mind that, for if\nthe cock should happen to crow, and you are not attending to\nthe yarn, it will become tow.  The man was willing and took\ngood care not to loiter.  He got up as quickly as he could,\nand went into the kitchen.  But when he reached the kettle\nand peeped in, he saw, to his horror, nothing but a lump of\ntow.  Then the poor man was as still as a mouse, thinking\nhe had neglected it, and was to blame, and in future said\nno more about yarn and spinning.  But you yourself must own\nthat she was an odious woman.\n", "The Lord's Animals and the Devil's": "The Lord God had created all animals, and had chosen out the wolf to\nbe his dog, but he had forgotten the goat.  Then the devil made\nready and began to create also, and created goats with fine long\ntails.  Now when they went to pasture, they generally remained\ncaught in the hedges by their tails, whereupon the devil had to go\nand disentangle them, with a great deal of trouble.  This enraged\nhim at last, and he went and bit off the tail of every goat, as may\nbe seen to this day by the stump.\nThen he let them go to pasture alone, but it came to pass that the\nLord God perceived how at one time they gnawed away at a fruitful\ntree, at another injured the noble vines, or destroyed other tender\nplants.  This distressed him, so that in his goodness and mercy he\nsummoned his wolves, who soon tore in pieces the goats that went\nthere.  When the devil observed this, he went before the Lord and\nsaid, your creatures have destroyed mine.  The Lord answered, why\ndid you create things to do harm.  The devil said, I was compelled\nto do it, inasmuch as my thoughts run on evil.  What I\ncreate can have no other nature, and you must pay me heavy damages.\nI will pay you as soon as the oak leaves fall, come then, your money\nwill then be ready counted out.  When the oak-leaves had fallen, the\ndevil came and demanded what was due to him.  But the Lord said, in\nthe church of constantinople stands a tall oaktree which still has\nall its leaves.  With raging and curses, the devil departed, and\nwent to seek the oak, wandered in the wilderness for six months\nbefore he found it, and when he returned, all the oaks had in the\nmeantime covered themselves again with green leaves.  Then he had to\nforfeit his indemnity, and in his rage he put out the eyes of all\nthe remaining goats, and put his own in instead.\nThis is why all goats have devil's eyes, and their tails bitten off,\nand why he likes to assume their shape.\n", "The Beam": "There was once a sorcerer who was standing in the midst of a\ngreat crowd of people performing his wonders.  He had a cock\nbrought in, which lifted a heavy beam and carried it as if\nit were light as a feather.  But a girl was present who had\njust found a four-leaved clover, and had thus become so wise\nthat no deception could stand out against her, and she saw\nthat the beam was nothing but a straw.  So she cried, you\npeople, do you not see that it is a straw that the cock is\ncarrying, and no beam.  Immediately the enchantment vanished,\nand the people saw what it was, and drove the magician away\nin shame and disgrace.  He, however, full of inward anger,\nsaid, I will soon revenge myself.\nAfter some time the girl's wedding-day came, and she was\ndecked out, and went in a great procession over the fields to\nthe place where the church was.  All at once she came to a\nstream which was very much swollen, and there was no bridge\nand no plank to cross it.  Then the bride nimbly took her\nclothes up, and wanted to wade through it.  And just as she\nwas thus standing in the water, a man, and it was the\nsorcerer, cried mockingly close beside her, aha.  Where are\nyour eyes that you take that for water.  Then her eyes were\nopened, and she saw that she was standing with her clothes\nlifted up in the middle of a field that was blue with the\nflowers of blue flax.  Then all the people saw it likewise,\nand chased her away with ridicule and laughter.\n", "The Old Beggar-Woman": "There was once an old woman, but you have surely seen an old\nwoman go a-begging before now.  This woman begged likewise,\nand when she got anything she said, may God reward you.  The\nbeggar-woman came to a door, and there by the fire a friendly\nrogue of a boy was standing warming himself.  The boy said\nkindly to the poor old woman as she was standing shivering\nthus by the door, come, old mother, and warm yourself.  She\ncame in, but stood too near the fire, so that her old rags\nbegan to burn, and she was not aware of it.  The boy stood\nand saw that, but he ought to have put the flames out.  Is it\nnot true that he ought to have put them out.  And if he had\nnot any water, then he should have wept all the water in\nhis body out of his eyes, and that would have supplied two\npretty streams with which to extinguish them.\n", "Odds and Ends": "There was once on a time a maiden who was pretty, but idle\nand negligent.  When she had to spin she was so out of\ntemper that if there was a little knot in the flax, she\nat once pulled out a whole heap of it, and strewed it about\non the ground beside her.  Now she had a servant who was\nindustrious, and gathered together the bits of flax which\nwere thrown away, cleaned them, spun them fine, and had a\nbeautiful gown made out of them for herself.  A young man\nhad wooed the lazy girl, and the wedding was to take place.\nOn the eve of the wedding, the industrious one was dancing\nmerrily about in her pretty dress, and the bride said, ah,\nhow that girl does jump about, dressed in my hurds.\nThe bridegroom heard that, and asked the bride what she meant\nby it.  Then she told him that the girl was wearing a dress\nmade of the flax which she had thrown away.  When the\nbridegroom heard that, and saw how idle she was, and how\nindustrious the poor girl was, he gave her up and went to the\nother, and chose her as his wife.\n", "The Story of Schlauraffen Land": "In the time of schlauraffen I went forth and saw rome and the\nlateran hanging by a small silken thread, and a man without feet who\noutran a swift horse, and a keen sharp sword that cut through a\nbridge.  I saw a young ass with a silver nose which pursued two\nfleet hares, and a lime-tree that was very large, on which hot cakes\nwere growing.  I saw a lean old goat which carried about a hundred\ncart-loads of fat on his body, and sixty loads of salt.  Have I not\ntold enough lies.  I saw a plough ploughing without horse or cow,\nand a child of one year threw four millstones from ratisbon to\ntreves, and from treves to strasburg, and a hawk swam over the\nrhine, which he had a perfect right to do.  I heard some fishes\nbegin to make such a disturbance with each other, that it resounded\nas far as heaven, and sweet honey flowed like water from a deep\nvalley to the top of a high mountain, and these were strange things.\nThere were two crows which were mowing a meadow, and I saw two gnats\nbuilding a bridge, and two doves tore a wolf to pieces, two children\nbrought forth two kids, and two frogs threshed corn\ntogether.  I saw two mice consecrating a bishop, and two cats\nscratching out a bear's tongue.  Then a snail came running up and\nkilled two furious lions.  There stood a barber and shaved a woman's\nbeard off, and two sucking-children bade their mother hold her\ntongue.  There I saw two greyhounds which brought a mill out of the\nwater, and a broken-down old horse was beside it, and said it was\nright.  And four horses were standing in the yard threshing corn\nwith all their might, and two goats were heating the stove, and a\nred cow shot the bread into the oven.  Then a hen crowed,\ncock-a-doodle-doo.  The story is all told, cock-a-doodle-doo.\n", "The Ditmarsch Tale of Wonders": "I will tell you something.  I saw two roasted fowls flying,\nthey flew quickly and had their breasts turned to heaven and\ntheir backs to hell, and an anvil and a mill-stone swam across\nthe rhine prettily, slowly, and gently, and a frog sat on\nthe ice at whitsuntide and ate a ploughshare.  Three fellows\nwho wanted to catch a hare, went on crutches and stilts, one\nof them was deaf, the second blind, the third dumb, and the\nfourth could not stir a step.  Do you want to know how it was\ndone.  First, the blind man saw the hare running across the\nfield, the dumb one called to the lame one, and the lame one\nseized it by the neck.\nThere were certain men who wished to sail on dry land, and\nthey set their sails in the wind, and sailed away over great\nfields.  Then they sailed over a high mountain, and there\nthey were miserably drowned.  A crab was chasing a hare which\nwas running away at full speed, and high up on the roof lay\na cow which had climbed up there.  In that country the flies\nare as big as the goats are here.  Open the window that the\nlies may fly out.\n", "A Riddling Tale": "Three women were transformed into flowers which grew in\nthe field, but one of them was allowed to be in her own home at\nnight.  Then once when day was drawing near, and she was forced to\ngo back to her companions in the field and become a flower again,\nshe said to her husband, if you will come this afternoon and\ngather me, I shall be set free and henceforth stay with you.  And\nhe did so.  Now the question is, how did her husband know her, for\nthe flowers were exactly alike, and without any difference.\nAnswer - as she was at her home during the night and not in the\nfield, no dew fell on her as it did on the others, and by this\nher husband knew her.\n", "The Wise Servant": "How fortunate is the master, and how well all goes in his\nhouse, when he has a wise servant who listens to his orders\nand does not obey them, but prefers following his own wisdom.  A\nclever Hans of this kind was once sent out by his master to seek a\nlost cow.  He stayed away a long time, and the master thought,\nfaithful Hans does not spare any pains over his work.  But when\nhe did not come back at all, the master was afraid lest some\nmisfortune had befallen him, and set out himself to look for\nhim.  He had to search a long time, but at last he caught sight\nof the boy running up and down a large field.  Now, dear Hans,\nsaid the master when he had got up to him, have you found the cow\nwhich I sent you to\nseek.  No, master, he answered, I have not found the cow, but\nthen I have not looked for it.  Then what have you looked for,\nHans.  Three blackbirds, answered the boy.  And where are they,\nasked the master.  I see one of them, I hear the other, and I\nam running after the third, answered the wise boy.\nTake example by this, do not trouble yourselves about your\nmasters or their orders, but rather do what comes into your\nhead and pleases you, and then you will act just as wisely as\nclever Hans.\n", "The Peasant in Heaven": "Once upon a time a poor pious peasant died, and arrived before\nthe gate of heaven.  At the same time a very rich, rich lord\ncame there who also wanted to get into heaven.  Then saint\npeter came with the key, and opened the door, and let the\ngreat man in, but apparently did not see the peasant, and shut\nthe door again.  And now the peasant outside heard how the\ngreat man was received in heaven with all kinds of rejoicing,\nand how they were making music, and singing within.  At length\nall became quiet again, and saint peter came and opened the gate\nof heaven, and let the peasant in.  The peasant, however,\nexpected that they would make music and sing when he went in\nalso, but all remained quite quiet.  He was received with great\naffection, it is true, and the angels came to meet him, but no\none sang.  Then the peasant asked saint peter how it was that\nthey did not sing for him as they had done when the rich man\nwent in, and said that it seemed to him that there in heaven\nthings were done with just as much partiality as on earth.  Then\nsaid saint peter, by no means, you are just as dear to us as\nanyone else, and will enjoy every heavenly delight that the\nrich man enjoys, but poor fellows like you come to heaven every\nday, but a rich man like this does not come more than once in a\nhundred years.\n", "Lean Lisa": "Lean lisa was of a very different way of thinking from lazy\nharry and fat trina, who never let anything disturb their\npeace.  She slaved away from morning till evening, and\nburdened her husband, long laurence, with so much work that\nhe had heavier weights to carry than an ass with three sacks.\nBut it was\nall to no purpose, for they had nothing and came to nothing.\nOne night as she lay in bed, and could hardly move one limb for\nweariness, she still did not allow her thoughts to go to sleep.\nShe thrust her elbow into her husband's side, and said, listen,\nlenz, to what I have been thinking.  If I were to find one florin\nand one was given to me, I would borrow another to put to them,\nand you too should give me another, and then as soon as I had\ngot the four florins together, I would buy a young cow.  This\npleased the husband right well.  It is true, said he, that I do\nnot know where I am to get the florin which you want as a gift\nfrom me.  But, if you can get the money together, and can buy a\ncow with it, you will do well to carry out your project.  I shall\nbe glad, he added, if the cow has a calf, and then I shall often\nget a drink of milk to refresh me.  The milk is not for you, said\nthe woman, we must let the calf suck that it may become big and\nfat, and we may be able to sell it well.  Certainly, replied the\nman, but still we will take a little milk.  That will do no harm.\nWho has taught you to manage cows,\nsaid the woman.  Whether it does harm or not, I will not allow it,\nand even if you were to stand on your head for it, you should not\nhave a drop of the milk.  Do you think, because there is no\nsatisfying you, long laurence, that you are to eat up what I earn\nwith so much difficulty.  Wife, said the man, be quiet, or I will\ngive you a blow on your mouth.  What, cried she, you threaten me,\nyou glutton, you rascal, you lazy harry.  She was just laying\nhold of his hair, but long laurence got up, seized both lean\nlisa's withered arms in one hand, and with the other he pressed\ndown her head into the pillow, let her scold, and held her until\nshe fell asleep for very weariness.  Whether she continued to\nwrangle when she awoke next morning, or whether she went out to\nlook for the florin which she wanted to find, that I know not.\n", "Sharing Joy and Sorrow": "There was once a tailor, who was a quarrelsome fellow, and\nhis wife, who was good, industrious, and pious, never could\nplease him.  Whatever she did, he was not satisfied, but\ngrumbled and scolded, and knocked her about and beat her.  As\nthe authorities at last heard of it, they had him summoned\nand put in prison in order to make him better.  He was kept\nfor a while on bread and water, and then set free again.  He\nwas forced, however, to promise not to beat his wife any\nmore, but to live with her in peace, and share joy and\nsorrow with her, as married people ought to do.  All went\non well for a time, but then he fell into his old ways and\nwas surly and quarrelsome.  And because he dared not beat her,\nhe would seize her by the hair and tear it out.  The woman\nescaped from him, and sprang out into the yard, but he ran\nafter her with his yard-measure and scissors, and chased her\nabout, and threw the yard-measure and scissors at her, and\nwhatever else came his way.  When he hit her he laughed, and\nwhen he missed her, he stormed and swore.  This went on so long\nthat the neighbors came to the wife's assistance.  The tailor\nwas again summoned before the magistrates, and reminded of his\npromise.  Dear gentlemen, said he, I have kept my word, I have\nnot beaten her, but have shared joy and sorrow with her.  How\ncan that be, said the judge, as she continues to bring such\nheavy complaints against you.  I have not beaten her, but just\nbecause she looked so strange I wanted to comb her hair with\nmy hand.  She, however, got away from me, and left me quite\nspitefully.  Then I hurried after her, and in order to bring\nher back to her duty, I threw at her as a well-meant reminder\nwhatever came readily to hand.  I have shared joy and sorrow\nwith her also, for whenever I hit her I was full of joy and\nshe of sorrow, and if I missed her, then she was joyful, and I\nsorry.  The judges were not satisfied with this answer, but\ngave him the reward he deserved.\n", "The Willow-Wren": "In olden times every sound still had its meaning and significance.\nWhen the smith's hammer resounded, it cried, \"Strike away, strike\naway.\"  When the carpenter's plane grated, it said, \"Here goes, here\ngoes.\"  If the mill wheel began to clack, it said, \"Help, Lord God,\nhelp, Lord God.\"  And if the miller was a cheat and set the mill\na-going, it spoke high german, and first asked slowly, \"Who is\nthere?  Who is there?\"  And then answered quickly, \"The miller,\nthe miller.\"  And at last quite in a hurry, \"He steals bravely,\nHe steals bravely, three pecks in a bushel.\"\n\nAt this time the birds also had their own language which every\none understood.  Now it only sounds like chirping, screeching, and\nwhistling, and sometimes like music without words.  It came into\nthe birds' mind, however, that they would no longer be without a\nruler, and would choose one of themselves to be their king.  One\nalone among them, the green plover, was opposed to this.  He\nhad lived free and would die free, and anxiously flying hither\nand thither, he cried, \"Where shall I go?  Where shall I go?\"  He\nretired into a solitary and unfrequented marsh, and showed himself\nno more among his fellows.\n\nThe birds now wished to discuss the matter, and on a fine may\nmorning they all gathered together from the woods and fields,\neagles and chaffinches, owls and crows, larks and sparrows, how\ncan I name them all.  Even the cuckoo came, and the hoopoe, his\nclerk, who is so called because he is always heard a few days\nbefore him, and a very small bird which as yet had no name,\nmingled with the band.  The hen, which by some accident had\nheard nothing of the whole matter, was astonished at the great\nassemblage.  What, what, what is going to be done, she cackled.\nBut the cock calmed his beloved hen, and said, only a lot of\nrich people, and told her what they had on hand.  It was\ndecided that the one who could fly the highest should be king.\nA tree-frog which was sitting among the bushes, when he heard\nthat, cried a warning, no, no, no, no, because he thought that\nmany tears would be shed because of this.  But the crow said, caw,\ncaw, and that all would pass off peaceably.\n\nIt was now determined that on this fine morning they should at\nonce begin to ascend, so that hereafter no one should be able\nto say, I could easily have flown much higher, but the evening\ncame on, and I could do no more.  On a given signal, therefore,\nthe whole troop rose up in the air.  The dust ascended from the\nland, and there was tremendous fluttering and whirring and\nbeating of wings, and it looked as if a black cloud was rising\nup.  The little birds were soon left behind.  They could go no\nfarther, and fell back to the ground.  The larger birds held\nout longer, but none could equal the\neagle, who mounted so high that he could have plucked the eyes\nout of the sun.  And when he saw that the others could not get\nup to him, he thought, why should you fly still higher.  You are\nthe king, and began to let himself down again.  The birds beneath\nhim at once cried to him, you must be our king, no one has flown\nso high as you.  Except me, screamed the little fellow without a\nname, who had crept into the breast-feathers of the eagle.  And\nas he was not at all tired, he rose up and mounted so high that\nhe reached heaven itself.  However, when he had gone as far as\nthis, he folded his wings together, and called down with clear\nand penetrating voice, I am king.  I am king.\nYou, our king, cried the birds angrily.  You have managed it\nby trick and cunning.  So they made another condition.  He\nshould be king who could go down lowest in the ground.  How\nthe goose did flap about with its broad breast when it was once\nmore on land.  How quickly the cock scratched a hole.  The\nduck came off the worst of all, for she leapt into a ditch,\nbut sprained her legs, and waddled away to a neighboring pond,\ncrying, cheating, cheating.  The little bird without a name,\nhowever, sought out a mouse-hole, slipped down into it, and\ncried out of it with his small voice, I am king.  I am king.\nYou our king, cried the birds still more angrily.  Do you\nthink your cunning shall prevail.  They determined to keep him\na prisoner in the hole and starve him out.  The owl was placed\nas sentinel in front of it, and was not to let the rascal out\nif she had any value for her life.  When evening was come and all\nthe birds were feeling very tired after the exertion of so much\nflying, they went to bed with their wives and children.\nThe owl alone remained standing by the mouse-hole, gazing\nsteadfastly into it with her great eyes.  Then she, too, grew\ntired and thought to herself, you might certainly shut one eye,\nyou will still watch with the other, and the little villain\nshall not come out of his hole.  So she shut one eye,\nand with the other looked straight at the mouse-hole.  The\nlittle fellow put his head out and peeped, and wanted to slip\naway, but the owl came forward immediately, and he drew his head\nback again.  Then the owl opened the one eye again, and shut the\nother, intending to shut them in turn all through the\nnight.  But when she next shut the one eye, she forgot to open\nthe other, and as soon as both her eyes were shut she\nfell asleep.  The little fellow soon observed that, and slipped\naway.\nFrom that day forth, the owl has never dared to show herself by\ndaylight, for if she does the other birds chase her and pluck her\nfeathers out.  She flies out only by night, but hates and\npursues mice because they make such ugly holes.  The little\nbird, too, is very unwilling to let himself be seen,\nbecause he is afraid it will cost him his life if he is caught.\nHe steals about in the hedges, and when he is quite safe, he\nsometimes cries, I am king, and for this reason, the other\nbirds call him in mockery, king of the hedges.  No one, however,\nwas so happy as the lark at not having to obey the little\nking.  As soon as the sun appears, she ascends high in the air\nand cries, ah, how beautiful that is.  Beautiful that is.\nBeautiful'beautiful.  Ah, how beautiful that is.\n", "The Sole": "The fishes had for a long time been discontented because no\norder prevailed in their kingdom.  None of them turned\naside for the others, but all swam to the right or the left\nas they fancied, or darted between those who wanted to\nstay together, or got into their way.  And a strong one gave\na weak one a blow with its tail, which drove it away, or else\nswallowed it up without more ado.  How delightful it would be,\nsaid they, if we had a king who enforced law and justice among us,\nand they met together to choose for their ruler the one who could\ncleave through the water most quickly, and give help to the\nweak ones.\nThey placed themselves in rank and file by the shore, and the\npike gave the signal with his tail, on which they all started.\nLike an arrow, the pike darted away, and with him the herring,\nthe gudgeon, the perch, the carp, and all the rest of them.\nEven the sole swam with them, and hoped to win the race.\nAll at once, the cry was heard, the herring is first, the\nherring is first.  Who is first, screamed angrily the flat envious\nsole, who had been left far behind,  who is first.  The herring,\nthe herring, was the answer.  The naked herring, cried the\njealous creature, the naked herring.  Since that time the sole\nhas been punished by having been given a mouth on one side.\n", "The Bittern and the Hoopoe": "Where do you like best to feed your flocks, said a man\nto an old cowherd.  Here, sir, where the grass is neither\ntoo rich nor too poor, or else it is no use.  Why not,\nasked the man.  Do you hear that melancholy cry from the meadow\nthere, answered the cowherd, that is the bittern.  He was once\na cowherd, and so was the hoopoe also, I will tell you the\nstory.  The bittern pastured his flocks on rich green meadows where\nflowers grew in abundance, so his cows became wild and unmanageable.\nThe hoopoe drove his cattle on to high barren hills, where the\nwind plays with the sand, and his cows became thin, and got no\nstrength.  When it was evening, and the cowherds wanted\nto drive their cows homewards, the bittern could not get his\ntogether again.  They were too high-spirited, and ran away from\nhim.  He called, come, cows, come, but it was of no use.  They\ntook no notice of his calling.  The hoopoe, however, could not\neven get his cows up on\ntheir legs, so faint and weak had they become.  Up, up, up, screamed\nhe, but it was in vain, they remained lying on the sand.\nThat is the way when one has no moderation.  And to this day,\nthough they have no flocks now to watch, the bittern cries,\ncome, cows, come, and the hoopoe, up, up, up.\n", "The Owl": "Two or three hundred years ago, when people were far from being so\ncrafty and cunning as they are nowadays, an extraordinary event\ntook place in a little town.  By some mischance one of the great\nowls, called horned owls, had come from the neighboring woods into\nthe barn of one of the townsfolk in the night-time, and when day\nbroke did not dare to venture forth again from her retreat, for\nfear of the other birds, which raised a terrible outcry whenever\nshe appeared.  In the morning when the man-servant went into the\nbarn to fetch some straw, he was so mightily alarmed at the sight\nof the owl sitting there in a corner, that he ran away and\nannounced to his master that a monster, the like of which he had\nnever set eyes on in his life, and which could devour a man\nwithout the slightest difficulty, was sitting in the barn, rolling\nits eyes about in its head.  I know your kind, said the master,\nyou have courage enough to chase a blackbird about the fields, but\nwhen you see a hen lying dead, you have to get a stick before you\ngo near it.  I must go and see for myself what kind of a monster\nit is, added the master, and went quite boldly into the granary\nand looked round him.  When, however, he saw with his own eyes\nthe strange grim creature, he was no less terrified than the\nservant had been.  With two bounds he sprang out, ran to his\nneighbours, and begged them imploringly to lend him assistance\nagainst an unknown and dangerous beast, or else the whole town\nmight be in danger if it\nwere to break loose out of the barn, where it was shut up.  A\ngreat noise and clamor arose in all the streets, the townsmen\ncame armed with spears, hay-forks, scythes, and axes, as if they\nwere going out against an enemy.  Finally, the senators appeared\nwith the burgomaster at their head.  When they had drawn up in\nthe market-place, they marched to the barn, and surrounded it on\nall sides.  Thereupon one of the most courageous of them stepped\nforth and entered with his spear lowered, but came running out\nimmediately afterwards with a shriek and as pale as death, and\ncould not utter a single word.  Yet two others ventured in, but\nthey fared no better.  At last one stepped forth, a great strong\nman who was famous for his warlike deeds, and said, you will not\ndrive away the monster by merely looking at him, we must be in\nearnest here, but I see that you have all tuned into women, and\nnot one of you dares to encounter the animal.  He ordered them\nto give him some armor, had a sword and spear brought, and armed\nhimself.  All praised his courage, though many feared for his\nlife.  The two barn-doors were opened, and they saw the owl, which\nin the meantime had perched herself on the middle of a great\ncross-beam.  He had a ladder brought, and when he raised it, and\nmade ready to climb up, they all cried out to him that he was to\nbear himself bravely, and commended him to St. George, who slew\nthe dragon.  When he had just got to the top, and the owl\nperceived that he had designs on her, and was also bewildered by\nthe crowd and the shouting, and knew not how to escape, she\nrolled her eyes, ruffled her feathers, flapped her wings,\nsnapped her beak, and cried, tuwhit, tuwhoo, in a harsh voice.\nStrike home.  Strike home.  Screamed the crowd outside to the\nvaliant hero.  Any one who was standing where I am standing,\nanswered he, would not cry, strike home.  He certainly did plant\nhis foot one rung higher on the ladder, but then he began to\ntremble, and half-fainting, went back again.\nAnd now there was no one left who dared to place himself in such\ndanger.  The monster, said they, has poisoned and mortally\nwounded the very strongest man among us, by snapping at him and\njust breathing on him.  Are we, too, to risk our lives.  They took\ncounsel as to what they ought to do to prevent the whole town from\nbeing destroyed.  For a long time everything seemed to be of no\nuse, but at length the burgomaster found an expedient.  My\nopinion, said he, is that we ought, out of the common purse, to\npay for this barn, and whatsoever corn, straw, or hay it contains,\nand thus indemnify the owner, and then burn down the whole\nbuilding and the terrible beast with it.  Thus no one will have to\nendanger his life.  This is no time for thinking of expense,\nand stinginess would be ill applied.  All agreed with him.  So\nthey set fire to the barn at all four corners, and with it the\nowl was miserably burnt.  Let any one who will not believe it,\ngo thither and inquire for himself.\n", "The Moon": "In days gone by there was a land where the nights were always dark,\nand the sky spread over it like a black cloth, for there the moon\nnever rose, and no star shone in the gloom.  At the creation of\nthe world, the light at night had been sufficient.  Three young\nfellows once went out of this country on a traveling expedition,\nand arrived in another kingdom, where, in the evening when the sun\nhad disappeared behind the mountains, a shining globe was placed\non an oak-tree, which shed a soft light far and wide.  By means\nof this, everything could very well be seen and distinguished,\neven though it was not so brilliant as the sun.  The travelers\nstopped and\nasked a countryman who was driving past with his cart, what kind\nof a light that was.  That is the moon, answered he, our mayor\nbought it for three talers, and fastened it to the oak-tree.  He\nhas to pour oil into it daily, and to keep it clean, so that it\nmay always burn clearly.  He receives a taler a week from us\nfor doing it.\nWhen the countryman had driven away, one of them said, we could\nmake some use of this lamp, we have an oak-tree at home, which is\njust as big as this, and we could hang it on that.  What a\npleasure it would be not to have to feel about at night in the\ndarkness.  I'll tell you what we'll do, said the second, we will\nfetch a cart and horses and carry away the moon.  The people here\nmay buy themselves another.  I'm a good climber, said the third, I\nwill bring it down.  The fourth brought a cart and horses, and the\nthird climbed the tree, bored a hole in the moon, passed a rope\nthrough it, and let it down.  When the shining ball lay in the\ncart, they covered it over with a cloth, that no one might observe\nthe theft.  They conveyed it safely into their own country, and\nplaced it on a high oak.  Old and young rejoiced, when the new\nlamp let its light shine over the whole land, and bed-rooms and\nsitting-rooms were filled with it.  The dwarfs came forth from\ntheir caves in the rocks, and the tiny elves in their little red\ncoats danced in rings on the meadows.\nThe four took care that the moon was provided with oil, cleaned\nthe wick, and received their weekly taler, but they became old\nmen, and when one of them grew ill, and saw that he was about to\ndie, he appointed that one quarter of the moon, should, as his\nproperty, be laid in the grave with him.  When he died, the mayor\nclimbed up the tree, and cut off a quarter with the hedge-shears,\nand this was placed in his coffin.  The light of the moon\ndecreased, but still not visibly.  When the second died, the\nsecond quarter was buried with him, and the light diminished.  It\ngrew weaker still after the death of the third, who likewise took\nhis part of it away with him, and when the fourth was borne to his\ngrave, the old state of darkness recommenced, and whenever the\npeople went out at night without their lanterns they knocked\ntheir heads together in collision.\nWhen, however, the pieces of the moon had united themselves\ntogether again in the world below, where darkness had always\nprevailed, it came to pass that the dead became restless and awoke\nfrom their sleep.  They were astonished when they were able to\nsee again, the moonlight was quite sufficient for them, for their\neyes had become so weak that they could not have borne the\nbrilliance of the sun.  They rose up and were merry, and fell\ninto their former ways of living.  Some of them went to the play\nand to dance, others hastened to the public-houses, where they\nasked for wine, got drunk, brawled, quarreled, and at last took\nup cudgels, and belabored each other.  The noise became greater and\ngreater, and at last reached even to heaven.\nSt. Peter, who guards the gate of heaven, thought the lower world\nhad broken out in revolt and gathered together the heavenly hosts,\nwhich were employed to drive back the evil one when he and his\nassociates storm the abode of the blessed.  As these, however,\ndid not come, he got on his horse and rode through the gate of\nheaven, down into the world below.  There he reduced the dead to\nsubjection, bade them lie down in their graves again, took the\nmoon away with him, and hung it up in heaven.\n", "The Duration of Life": "When God created the world and was about to fix the length of\neach creature's life, the ass came and asked, Lord, how long shall\nI live.  Thirty years, replied God, does that content you.  Ah,\nLord, answered the ass, that is a long time.  Think of my painful\nexistence.  To carry heavy burdens from morning to night, to drag\nsacks of corn to the mill that others may eat bread, to be\ncheered and refreshed with nothing but blows and kicks.  Relieve\nme of a portion of this long time.  Then God had pity on him and\nrelieved him of eighteen years.  The ass went away comforted, and\nthe dog appeared.  How long would you like to live, said God to\nhim, thirty years are too many for the ass, but you will be\nsatisfied with that.  Lord, answered the dog, is that thy will.\nConsider how I shall have to run, my feet will never hold out so\nlong, and when I have once lost my voice for barking, and my teeth\nfor biting, what will be left for me to do but run from one\ncorner to another and growl.  God saw that he was right, and\nreleased him from twelve years of life.  Then came the monkey.\nYou will certainly live thirty years willingly, said the Lord to\nhim, you have no need to work as the ass and the dog have to, and\nwill always enjoy yourself.  Ah, Lord, he answered, it may seem\nas if that were the case, but it is quite different.  When it\nrains millet-porridge I have no spoon.  I am always to play merry\npranks, and make faces which force people to laugh, and if they\ngive me an apple, and I bite into it, why, it is sour.  How often\nsadness hides itself behind mirth.  I shall never be able to hold\nout for thirty years.  God was gracious and took off ten.\nAt last man appeared, joyous, healthy and vigorous, and begged\nGod to appoint his time for him.  Thirty years shall you live,\nsaid the Lord.  Is that enough for you.  What a short time, cried\nman, when I have built my house and my fire burns on my own\nhearth, when I have planted trees which blossom and bear fruit,\nand am just intending to enjoy my life, I am to die.  O Lord,\nlengthen my time.  I will add to it the ass's eighteen years, said\nGod.  That is not enough, replied the man.  You shall also have\nthe dog's twelve years.  Still too little.  Well, then, said God,\nI will give you the monkey's ten years also, but more you shall\nnot have.  The man went away, but was not satisfied.\nSo man lives seventy years.  The first thirty are his human\nyears, which are soon gone, then is he healthy, merry, works with\npleasure, and is glad of his life.  Then follow the ass's\neighteen years, when one burden after another is laid on him, he\nhas to carry the corn which feeds others, and blows and kicks are\nthe reward of his faithful services.  Then comes the dog's twelve\nyears, when he lies in the corner, and growls and has no longer\nany teeth to bite with, and when this time is over the monkey's\nten years form the end.  Then man is weak-headed and foolish,\ndoes silly things, and becomes the jest of children.\n", "Death's Messengers": "In ancient times a giant was once traveling on a great highway,\nwhen suddenly an unknown man sprang up before him, and said,\nhalt, not one step farther.  What.  Cried the giant, a creature\nwhom I can crush between my fingers, wants to block my way.  Who\nare you that you dare to speak so boldly.  I am death, answered\nthe other.  No one resists me, and you also must obey my commands.\nBut the giant refused, and began to struggle with death.  It was\na long, violent battle, in which at last the giant got\nthe upper hand, and struck death down with his fist, so that he\ncollapsed by a stone.  The giant went his way, and death lay there\nconquered, and so weak that he could not get up again.  What will\nbe done now, said he, if I stay lying here in a corner.  No one\nwill die in the world, and it will get so full of people that they\nwon't have room to stand beside each other.  In the meantime a\nyoung man came along the road, who was strong and healthy,\nsinging a song, and glancing around on every side.  When he saw\nthe half-fainting one, he went compassionately to him, raised him\nup, poured a strengthening draught out of his flask for him, and\nwaited till he regained some strength.  Do you know, said the\nstranger, whilst he was getting up, who I am, and who it is whom\nyou have helped on his legs again.  No, answered the youth, I do\nnot know you.  I am death, said he, I spare no one, and can make\nno exception with you - but that you may see that I am grateful,\nI promise you that I will not fall on you unexpectedly, but will\nsend my messengers to you before I come and take you away.  Well,\nsaid the youth, it is something gained that I shall know when\nyou come, and at any rate be safe from you for so long.  Then he\nwent on his way, and was light-hearted, and enjoyed himself,\nand lived\nwithout thought.  But youth and health did not last long.  Soon\ncame sicknesses and sorrows, which tormented him by day, and took\naway his rest by night.  Die, I shall not, said he to himself, for\ndeath will send his messengers before that, but I do wish these\nwretched days of sickness were over.  As soon as he felt\nhimself well again he began once more to live merrily.  Then one\nday someone tapped him on the shoulder.  He looked round, and\ndeath stood behind him, and said, follow me, the hour of your\ndeparture from this world has come.  What, replied the man, will\nyou break your word.  Did you not promise me that you would send\nyour messengers to me before coming yourself.  I have seen none.\nSilence, answered death.  Have I not sent one messenger to you\nafter another.  Did not fever come and smite you, and shake you,\nand cast you down.  Has not dizziness bewildered your head.  Has\nnot gout twitched you in all your limbs.  Did not your ears sing.\nDid not tooth-ache bite into your cheeks.  Was it not dark before\nyour eyes.  And besides all that, has not my own brother sleep\nreminded you every night of me.  Did you not lie by night as if\nyou were already dead.  The man could make no answer, he yielded\nto his fate, and went away with death.\n", "Master Pfriem": "Master pfriem was a short, thin, but lively man, who never\nrested a moment.  His face, of which his turned-up nose was\nthe only prominent feature, was marked with smallpox and pale as\ndeath.  His hair was gray and shaggy, his eyes small, but they\nglanced perpetually about on all sides.  He saw everything,\ncriticized everything, knew everything best, and was always in\nthe right.  When he went into the streets, he moved his arms\nabout as if he were rowing, and once he struck the pail of a girl\nso high in the air that he himself was wetted all over by the\nwater she was carrying.  Idiot.  Cried he to her, shaking\nhimself, could you not see that I was coming behind you.  By trade\nhe was a shoemaker, and when he worked he pulled his thread out\nwith such force that he drove his fist into everyone who did not\nkeep far enough off.  No apprentice stayed more than a month with\nhim, for he had always some fault to find with the very best work.\nAt one time it was that the stitches were not even, at another\nthat one shoe was too long, or one heel higher than the other,\nor the leather not cut large enough.  Wait, said he to his\napprentice, I will soon show you how we make skins soft.  And\nhe brought a strap and gave him a couple of lashes across the\nback.  He called them all sluggards.  He\nhimself did not turn much work out of his hands, for he never sat\nstill for a quarter of an hour.  If his wife got up very early in\nthe morning and lighted the fire, he jumped out of bed, and ran\nbarefooted into the kitchen, crying, will you burn my house down\nfor me.  That is a fire one could roast an ox by.  Does wood cost\nnothing.  If the servants were standing by their wash-tubs and\nlaughing, and telling each other what they knew, he scolded them,\nand said, there stand the geese cackling, and forgetting their\nwork, to gossip.  And why fresh soap.  Disgraceful extravagance\nand shameful idleness into the bargain.  They want to save their\nhands, and not rub the things properly.  And out he would run and\nknock a pail full of soap and water over, so that the whole\nkitchen was flooded.  Someone was building a new house, so he\nhurrried to the window to look on.  There, they are using that\nred sand-stone again that never dries, cried he.  No one will\never be healthy in that house.  And just look how badly the\nfellows are laying the stones.  Besides, the mortar is good for\nnothing.  It ought to have gravel in it, not sand.  I shall live\nto see that house tumble down on the people who are in it.\nHe sat down, put a couple of stitches in, and then jumped up\nagain, unfastened his leather-apron, and cried, I will just go\nout, and appeal to those men's consciences.  He stumbled on the\ncarpenters.  What's this, cried he, you are not working by the\nline.  Do you expect the beams to be straight - one wrong will\nput all wrong.  He snatched an axe out of a carpenter's hand and\nwanted to show him how he ought to cut, but as a cart loaded\nwith clay came by, he threw the axe away, and hastened to the\npeasant who was walking by the side of it, you are not in your\nright mind, said he, who yokes young horses to a heavily-laden\ncart.  The poor beasts will die on the spot.  The peasant did\nnot give him an answer, and pfriem in a rage ran back into his\nwork-shop.  When he was setting himself to work again, the\napprentice reached him a shoe.  Well, what's that again, screamed\nhe, haven't I told you you ought not to cut shoes so broad.  Who\nwould buy a shoe like this, which is hardly anything else but a\nsole.  I insist on my orders being followed exactly.  Master,\nanswered the apprentice, you may easily be quite right about the\nshoe being a bad one, but it is the one which you yourself cut\nout, and yourself set to work at.  When you jumped up a while\nago, you knocked it off the table, and I have only just picked it\nup.  An angel from heaven, however, would never make you believe\nthat.\nOne night master pfriem dreamed he was dead, and on his way to\nheaven.  When he got there, he knocked loudly at the door.  I\nwonder, said he to himself, that they have no knocker on the door,\none knocks one's knuckles sore.  The apostle peter opened the door,\nand wanted to see who demanded admission so noisily.  Ah, it's you\nmaster pfriem, said he, well, I'll let you in, but I warn you\nthat you must give up that habit of yours, and find fault with\nnothing you see in heaven, or you may fare ill.  You might have\nspared your warning, answered pfriem.  I know already what is\nseemly, and here, God be thanked, everything is perfect, and there\nis nothing to blame as there is on earth.  So he went in, and\nwalked up and down the wide expanses of heaven.  He looked\naround him, to the left and to the right, but sometimes shook his\nhead, or muttered something to himself.  Then he saw two angels\nwho were carrying away a beam.  It was the beam which someone had\nhad in his own eye whilst he was looking for the splinter in the\neye of another.  They did not carry the beam lengthways,\nhowever, but obliquely.  Did anyone ever see such a piece of\nstupidity, thought master pfriem.  But he said nothing, and seemed\nsatisfied with it.  It comes to the same thing after all,\nwhichever way they carry the beam, straight or athwart, if they\nonly get along with it, and truly I do not see them knock against\nanything.  Soon after this he saw two angels who were drawing\nwater out of a well into a bucket, but at the same time he\nobserved that the bucket was full of holes, and that the water\nwas running out of it on every side.  They were watering the\nearth with rain.  Hang it, he exclaimed, but happily recollected\nhimself, and thought, perhaps it is only a pastime.  If it is\nan amusement, then it seems they can do useless things of this\nkind, especially here in heaven, where people, as I have already\nnoticed, do nothing but idle about.  He went farther\nand saw a cart which had stuck fast in a deep hole.  It's no\nwonder, said he to the man who stood by, who would load so\nunreasonably.  What have you there.  Good wishes, replied the man,\nI could not get on the right way with it, but still I have pushed\nit safely up here, and here they won't leave me stuck.  In fact\nan angel did come and harness two horses to it.  That's quite\nright, thought pfriem, but two horses won't get that cart out, it\nmust at least have four to it.  Another angel came and brought\ntwo more horses, she did not harness them in front of it,\nhowever, but behind.  That was too much for master pfriem, clumsy\ncreature, he burst out, what are you doing there.  Has anyone\never since the world began seen a cart drawn in that way.  But\nyou, in your conceited arrogance, think that you know everything\nbest.  He was going to say more, but one of the inhabitants of\nheaven seized him by the throat and pushed him forth with\nirresistible strength.  Beneath the gateway master pfriem turned\nhis head round to take one more look at the cart, and saw that it\nwas being raised into the air by four winged horses.\nAt this moment master pfriem awoke.  Things are certainly\narranged in heaven otherwise than they are on earth, said he to\nhimself, and that excuses much, but who can see horses harnessed\nboth behind and before with patience.  To be sure they had wings\nbut who could know that.  It is, beside, great folly to fix a\npair of wings to a horse that has four legs to run with already.\nBut I must get up, or else they will make nothing but mistakes\nin my house.  It is a lucky thing though, that I am not\nreally dead.\n", "The Little Folks' Presents": "A tailor and a goldsmith were traveling together, and one evening\nwhen the sun had sunk behind the mountains, they heard the sound\nof distant music, which became more and more distinct.  It sounded\nstrange, but so pleasant that they forgot all their weariness\nand stepped quickly onwards.  The moon had already arisen\nwhen they reached a hill on which they saw a crowd of little men\nand women, who had taken each other's hands, and were whirling\nround in the dance with the greatest pleasure and delight.\nThey sang to it most charmingly, and that was the music which the\ntravelers had heard.  In the midst of them sat an old man who was\nrather taller than the rest.  He wore a parti-colored coat, and his\nhoary beard hung down over his breast.  The two remained standing\nfull of astonishment, and watched the dance.  The old man made\na sign that they should enter, and the little folks willingly opened\ntheir circle.  The goldsmith, who had a hump, and like all\nhunch-backs was daring enough, stepped in.  The tailor felt a little\nafraid at first, and held back, but when he saw how merrily all\nwas going, he plucked up his courage, and followed.  The circle\nclosed again directly, and the little folks went on singing and\ndancing with the wildest leaps.  The old man, however, took a\nlarge knife which hung to his girdle, whetted it, and when it was\nsufficiently sharpened, he looked round at the strangers.  They\nwere terrified, but they had not much time for reflection, for the\nold man seized the goldsmith and with the greatest speed, shaved\nthe hair of his head clean off, and then the same thing happened to\nthe tailor.  But their fear left them when, after he had finished\nhis work, the old man clapped them both on the shoulder in a\nfriendly manner, as much as to say, they had behaved well to let\nall that be done to them willingly, and without any struggle.  He\npointed with his finger to a heap of coals which lay at one side,\nand signified to the travelers by his gestures that they were to\nfill their pockets with them.  Both of them obeyed, although they\ndid not know of what use the coals would be to them, and\nthen they went on their way to seek a shelter for the night.\nWhen they had got into the valley, the clock of the neighboring\nmonastery struck twelve, and the song ceased.  In a moment all had\nvanished, and the hill lay in solitude in the moonlight.\nThe two travelers found an inn, and covered themselves up on their\nstraw-beds with their coats, but in their weariness forgot to take\nthe coals out of them before doing so.  A heavy weight on their\nlimbs awakened them earlier than usual.  They felt in the pockets,\nand could not believe their eyes when they saw that they were not\nfilled with coals, but with pure gold.  Happily, too, the hair of\ntheir heads and beards was there again as thick as ever.\nThey had now become rich folks, but the goldsmith, who, in\naccordance with his greedy disposition, had filled his pockets\nbetter, was twice as rich as the tailor.  A greedy man, even if he\nhas much,\nstill wishes to have more, so the goldsmith proposed to the tailor\nthat they should wait another day, and go out again in the evening\nin order to bring back still greater treasures from the old man on\nthe hill.  The tailor refused, and said, I have enough and am\ncontent.  Now I shall be a master, and marry my dear object -\nfor so he called his sweetheart - and I am a happy man.  But he\nstayed another day to please him.  In the evening the goldsmith\nhung a couple of bags over his shoulders that he might be able\nto stow away a great deal, and took the road to the hill.  He\nfound, as on the night before, the little folks at their singing\nand dancing, and the old man again shaved him clean, and made\nsigns to him to take some coal.  He was not slow about stuffing\nas much into his bags as would go, went back quite delighted,\nand covered himself over with his\ncoat.  Even if the gold does weigh heavily, said he, I will gladly\nbear that, and at last he fell asleep with the sweet anticipation\nof waking in the morning an enormously rich man.\nWhen he opened his eyes, he got up in haste to examine his\npockets, but how amazed he was when he drew nothing out of them\nbut black coals, and that howsoever often he put his hands in\nthem.  The gold I got the night before is still there for me,\nthought he, and went and brought it out, but how shocked he was when\nhe saw that it likewise had again turned into coal.  He smote his\nforehead with his dusty black hand, and then he felt that his\nwhole head was bald and smooth, as was also the place where his\nbeard should have been.  But his misfortunes were not yet over.  He\nnow remarked for the first time that in addition to the\nhump on his back, a second, just as large, had grown in front on\nhis breast.  Then he recognized the punishment of his\ngreediness, and began to weep aloud.  The good tailor, who was\nawakened by this, comforted the unhappy fellow as well as he could,\nand said, you have been my comrade in my traveling time.  You shall\nstay with me and share in my wealth.  He kept his word, but the\npoor goldsmith was obliged to carry the two humps as long as he\nlived, and to cover his bald head with a cap.\n", "The Giant and the Tailor": "A certain tailor who was great at boasting but ill at doing,\ntook it into his head to go abroad for a while, and look about\nthe world.  As soon as he could manage it, he left his\nwork-shop, and wandered on his way, over hill and dale,\nsometimes hither, sometimes, thither, but ever on and on.  Once on\nhis way he perceived in the blue distance a steep hill, and behind\nit a tower\nreaching to the clouds, which rose up out of a wild dark forest.\nThunder and lightning, cried the tailor, what is that, and as he\nwas strongly goaded by curiosity, he went boldly towards it. But\nhow he did gaze and gape when he came near it, for the tower had\nlegs, and leapt in one bound over the steep hill, and was now\nstanding as an all-powerful giant before him.  What do you want here,\nyou tiny fly's leg, cried the giant, with a voice as if it were\nthundering on every side.  The tailor whimpered, I want just to\nlook about and see if I can earn a bit of bread for myself, in\nthis forest.  If that is what you are after, said the giant,\nyou may have a place with me.  If it must be, why not.  What wages\nshall I receive.  You shall hear what wages you shall have.  Every\nyear three hundred and sixty-five days, and when it is leap-year,\none more into the bargain.  Does that suit you.  All right,\nreplied the tailor, and thought, in his own mind, a man must cut\nhis coat according to his cloth.  I will try to get away as fast as\nI can.\nAt this the giant said to him, go, little ragamuffin, and fetch\nme a jug of water.  Had I not better bring the well itself\nat once, and the spring too, asked the boaster, and went with the\npitcher to the water.  What, the well and the spring too, growled\nthe giant in his beard, for he was somewhat of a silly dolt, and\nbegan\nto be afraid.  That knave is not a fool, he has a mandrake in\nhis body.  Be on your guard, old Hans, this is no serving-man for\nyou.  When the tailor had brought the water, the giant bade\nhim go into the forest, and cut a couple of blocks of\nwood and bring them back.  Why not the whole forest, at once,\nwith one stroke.  The whole forest, young and old, with\nall that is there, both gnarled and smooth, and the well and its\nspring too, growled the credulous giant in his beard, and was still\nmore terrified.  The knave can do much more than bake apples, and\nhas a mandrake in his body.  Be on your guard, old Hans, this is\nno serving-man for you.  When the tailor had brought the wood, the\ngiant commanded\nhim to shoot two or three wild boars for supper.  Why not\nrather a thousand at one shot, and bring them all here, inquired\nthe insolent tailor.  What, cried the timid giant in great terror.\nLet well alone to-night, and lie down to rest.\nThe giant was so terribly alarmed that he could not close an\neye all night long for thinking what would be the best way to\nget rid of this accursed sorcerer of a servant.  Time\nbrings counsel.  Next morning the giant and the tailor went to a\nmarsh, round which stood a number of willow-trees.  Then said\nthe giant, listen, tailor, seat yourself on one of the\nwillow-branches.  I long of all things to see if you are big enough\nto bend it down.  All at once the tailor was sitting on it, holding\nhis breath, and making himself heavy, so heavy that the bough\nbent down.  When, however, he was compelled to draw breath, it\nhurled him - for unfortunately he had not put his goose in his\npocket - so high into the air that he never was seen again, and\nthis to the great delight of the giant.  If the tailor has not\nfallen down again, he must still be hovering about in the air.\n", "The Nail": "A merchant had done good business at the fair.  He had sold his\nwares, and lined his money-bags with gold and silver.  Then he\nwanted to travel homewards, and be in his own house before\nnightfall.  So he packed his trunk with the money on his horse,\nand rode away.\nAt noon he rested in a town, and when he wanted to go farther\nthe stable-boy brought out his horse and said, a nail is\nwanting, sir, in the shoe of its near hind foot.  Let it be\nwanting, answered the merchant.  The shoe will certainly stay on\nfor the six miles I have still to go.  I am in a hurry.\nIn the afternoon, when he once more alighted and had his horse\nfed, the stable-boy went into the room to him and said, sir, a\nshoe is missing from your horse's near hind foot.  Shall I take\nhim to the blacksmith.  Let it be wanting, answered the man.\nThe horse can very well hold out for the couple of miles which\nremain.  I am in haste.\nHe rode forth, but before long the horse began to limp.  It had\nnot limped long before it began to stumble, and it had not\nstumbled long before it fell down and broke its leg.  The\nmerchant was forced\nto leave the horse where it was, and unbuckle the trunk, take it\non his back, and go home on foot.  And there he did not arrive\nuntil quite late at night.  And that cursed nail, said he to\nhimself, has caused all this disaster.\nThe more haste the less speed.\n", "The Hare and the Hedgehog": "This story, my dear young folks, seems to be false, but it really\nis true, for my grandfather, from whom I have it, used always,\nwhen relating it, to say, it must be true, my son, or else no\none could tell it to you.  The story is as follows.  One sunday\nmorning about harvest time, just as the buckwheat was in bloom,\nthe sun was shining brightly in heaven, the east wind was\nblowing warmly over the stubble-fields, the larks were singing\nin the air, the bees buzzing among the buckwheat, the people\nin their sunday clothes were all going to church, and all creatures\nwere happy, and the hedgehog was happy too.\nThe hedgehog, however, was standing by his door with his arms\nakimbo, enjoying the morning breezes, and slowly trilling a\nlittle song to himself, which was neither better nor worse than\nthe songs which hedgehogs are in the habit of singing on a blessed\nsunday morning.  Whilst he was thus singing half aloud to himself,\nit suddenly occurred to him that, while his wife was washing and\ndrying the children, he might very well take a walk into the field,\nand see how his turnips were getting on.  The turnips, in fact,\nwere close beside his house, and he and his family were accustomed\nto eat them, for which reason he looked upon them as his own.\nNo sooner said than\ndone.  The hedgehog shut the house-door behind him, and took the\npath to the field.  He had not gone very far from home, and\nwas just turning round the sloe-bush which stands there outside the\nfield, to go up into the turnip-field, when he observed the hare\nwho had gone out on business of the same kind, namely, to visit his\ncabbages.  When the hedgehog caught sight of the hare, he bade him\na friendly good morning.  But the hare, who was in his own way a\ndistinguished gentleman, and frightfully haughty, did not return\nthe hedgehog's greeting, but said to him, assuming at the same\ntime a very contemptuous manner, how do you happen to be\nrunning about here in the field so early in the morning.  I am\ntaking a walk, said the hedgehog.  A walk, said the hare, with\na smile.  It seems to me that you might use your legs for a better\npurpose.  This answer made the hedgehog furiously angry, for he\ncan bear anything but a reference too his legs, just because they\nare crooked by nature.  So now the hedgehog said to the hare, you\nseem to imagine that you can do more with your legs than I with\nmine.  That is just what I do think, said the hare.  That can\nbe put to the test, said the hedgehog.  I wager that if we run\na race, I will outstrip you.  That is ridiculous.  You with your\nshort legs, said the hare, but for my part I am willing, if you\nhave such a monstrous fancy for it.  What shall we wager.  A\ngolden louis-d'or and a bottle of brandy, said the hedgehog.  Done,\nsaid the hare.  Shake hands on it, and then we may as well begin\nat once.  Nay, said the hedgehog, there is no such great hurry.\nI am still fasting, I will go home first, and have a little\nbreakfast.  In half-an-hour I will be back again at this\nplace.\nHereupon the hedgehog departed, for the hare was quite satisfied\nwith this.  On his way the hedgehog thought to himself, the hare\nrelies on his long legs, but I will contrive to get the better\nof him.  He may be a great man, but he is a very silly fellow,\nand he shall pay for what he has said.  So when the hedgehog\nreached home, he said to his wife, wife, dress yourself quickly,\nyou must go out to the field with me.  What is going on, then,\nsaid his wife.  I have made a wager with the hare, for a gold\nlouis-d'or and a bottle of\nbrandy.  I am to run a race with him, and you must be present.\nGood heavens, husband, the wife now cried, are you not right in\nyour mind, have you completely lost your wits.  What can make\nyou want to run a race with the hare.  Hold your tongue, woman,\nsaid the hedgehog, that is my affair.  Don't begin to discuss\nthings which are matters for men.  Be off, dress yourself, and\ncome with me.  What could the hedgehog's wife do.  She was forced\nto obey him, whether she liked it or not.\nSo when they had set out on their way together, the hedgehog\nsaid to his wife, now pay attention to what I am going to say.\nLook you, I will make the long field our race-course.  The hare\nshall run in one furrow, and when the hare arrives at the end\nof the furrow on the other side of you, you must cry out to him,\nI am here already.\nThen they reached the field, and the hedgehog showed his wife\nher place, and then walked up the field.  When he reached the\ntop, the hare was already there.  Shall we start, said the\nhare.  Certainly, said the hedgehog.  Then both at once.  So\nsaying, each placed himself in his own furrow.  The hare counted,\nonce, twice, thrice, and away, and went off like a whirlwind\ndown the field.  The hedgehog, however, only ran about three\npaces, and then he crouched down in the furrow, and stayed\nquietly where he was.\nWhen the hare therefore arrived at full speed at the lower end\nof the field, the hedgehog's wife met him with the cry, I am\nhere already.  The hare was shocked and wondered not a little,\nhe thought no other than that it was the hedgehog himself who was\ncalling to him, for the hedgehog's wife looked just like her\nhusband.  The hare, however, thought to himself, that has not\nbeen done fairly, and cried, it must be run again, let us have it\nagain.  And once more he went off like the wind in a storm, so\nthat he seemed to fly.  But the hedgehog's wife stayed quietly\nin her place.  So when the hare reached the top of the field, the\nhedgehog himself cried out to him, I am here already.  The\nhare, however, quite beside himself\nwith anger, cried, it must be run again, we must have it again.\nAll right, answered the hedgehog, for my part we'll run as often\nas you choose.  So the hare ran seventy-three times more, and\nthe hedgehog always held out against him, and every time the\nhare reached either the top or the bottom, either the hedgehog\nor his wife said, I am here already.\nAt the seventy-fourth time, however, the hare could no longer\nreach the end.  In the middle of the field he fell to the\nground, blood streamed out of his mouth, and he lay dead on\nthe spot.  But the hedgehog took the louis-d'or which he had\nwon and the bottle of brandy, called his wife out of the furrow,\nand both went home together in great delight, and if they are not\ndead, they are living there still.\nThis is how it happened that the hedgehog made the hare run races\nwith him on the heath of buxtehude - buxtehude is a village near\nhamburg - till he died, and since that time no hare has ever\nhad any fancy for running races with a buxtehude hedgehog.\nThe moral of this story is, firstly, that no one, however great\nhe may be, should permit himself to jest at any one beneath him,\neven if he be only a hedgehog.  And, secondly, it teaches, that\nwhen a man marries, he should take a wife in his own position,\nwho looks just as he himself looks.  So whosoever is a\nhedgehog let him see to it that his wife is a hedgehog also,\nand so forth.\n", "The Peasant and the Devil": "There was once upon a time a far-sighted, crafty peasant whose\ntricks were much talked about.  The best story, however, is\nhow he once got hold of the devil, and made a fool of him.\nThe peasant had one day been working in his field, and as\ntwilight had set in, was making ready for the journey home, when\nhe saw a heap of burning coals in the middle of his field,\nand when,\nfull of astonishment, he went up to it, a little black devil\nwas sitting on the live coals.  Are you sitting upon a treasure,\nsaid the peasant.  Yes, in truth, replied the devil, on a treasure\nwhich contains more gold and silver than you have ever seen in\nyour life.  The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me, said\nthe peasant.  It is yours, answered the devil, if you will for\ntwo years give me one half of everything your field produces.\nMoney I have enough, but I have a desire for the fruits of the\nearth.  The peasant agreed to the bargain.  In order, however,\nthat no dispute may arise about the division, said he, everything\nthat is above ground shall belong to you, and what is under the\nearth to me.  The devil was quite satisfied with that, but the\ncunning peasant had sown turnips.\nNow when the time for harvest came, the devil appeared and\nwanted to take away his crop.  But he found nothing but the\nyellow withered leaves, while the peasant, full of delight,\nwas digging up his turnips.  You have had the best of it for once,\nsaid the devil, but the next time that won't do.  What grows\nabove ground shall be yours, and what is under it, mine.  I am\nwilling, replied the peasant.  But when the time came to sow, he\ndid not again sow turnips, but wheat.  The grain became ripe,\nand the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks\ndown to the ground.  When the devil came, he found nothing but\nthe stubble, and went away in a fury down into a cleft in the\nrocks.  That is the way to cheat the devil, said the\npeasant, and went and fetched away the treasure.\n", "The Crumbs on the Table": "George one day said to his little chickens, come into the\nparlor and enjoy yourselves, and pick up the bread-crumbs\non the table.  Your mistress has gone out to pay some visits.\nThen the chickens said, no, no, we will not go.  If\nthe mistress gets to know it, she will beat us.  George said,\nshe will\nknow nothing about it.  So come.  After all, she never gives\nyou anything good.  Then the chickens again said, nay, nay, we\nmust let it alone.  We must not go.  But george let them have\nno peace until at last they went, and got on the table, and ate\nup the bread-crumbs with all their might.  But at that very moment\nthe mistress came, and seized the stick in great haste, and\nbeat them and treated them very harshly.  And when they were\noutside the house, the chickens said to george, do, do, do, do,\ndo, you see.  Then george laughed and said, didn't, didn't, didn't,\nI expect it.  So they just had to run away.\n", "The Grave-Mound": "A rich farmer was one day standing in his yard inspecting his\nfields and gardens.  The corn was growing up vigorously\nand the fruit-trees were heavily laden with fruit.  The grain\nof the year before still lay in such immense heaps in the loft that\nthe rafters could hardly bear it.  Then he went into the stable,\nwhere were well-fed oxen, fat cows, and horses bright as\nlooking-glass.  At length he went back into his sitting-room, and\ncast a glance at the iron chest in which his money lay.\nWhilst he was thus standing surveying his riches, all at once there\nwas a loud knock close by him.  The knock was not at the door of\nhis room, but at the door of his heart.  It opened, and he heard\na voice which said to him, have you done good to your family with\nit.  Have you considered the necessities of the poor.  Have you\nshared your bread with the hungry.  Have you been contented with\nwhat you have, or did you always desire to have more.  The heart\nwas not slow in answering, I have been hard and pitiless, and have\nnever shown any kindness to my own family.  If a beggar came, I\nturned away my eyes from him.  I have not troubled myself about\nGod, but have thought only of increasing my wealth.  If everything\nwhich the sky covers had been mine own, I should still not have\nhad enough.\nWhen he was aware of this answer he was greatly alarmed, his\nknees began to tremble, and he was forced to sit down.\nThen there was another knock, but the knock was at the door of\nhis room.  It was his neighbor, a poor man who had a number of\nchildren whom he could no longer satisfy with food.  I know, thought\nthe poor man, that my neighbor is rich, but he is as hard as he is\nrich.  I don't believe he will help me, but my children are\ncrying for bread, so I will venture it.  He said to the rich man,\nyou do not readily give away anything that is yours, but I stand\nhere like one who feels the water rising above his head.  My\nchildren are starving, lend me four measures of corn.  The rich man\nlooked at him long, and then the first sunbeam of mercy began to\nmelt away a drop of the ice of greediness.  I will not lend you\nfour measures, he answered.  I will make you a present of eight,\nbut you must fulfil one condition.  What am I to do, said the poor\nman.  When I am dead, you shall watch for three nights by my\ngrave.  The peasant was disturbed in his mind at this request, but\nin the need in which he was, he would have consented to anything.\nHe accepted, therefore, and carried the corn home with him.\nIt seemed as if the rich man had foreseen what was about to happen,\nfor when three days were gone by, he suddenly dropped down dead.\nNo one knew exactly how it came to pass, but no one grieved for him.\nWhen he was buried, the poor man remembered his promise.  He\nwould willingly have been released from it, but he thought,\nafter all, he acted kindly by me.  I have fed my hungry children\nwith his corn, and even if that were not the case, where I have\nonce given my promise I must keep it.  At nightfall he went into\nthe churchyard, and seated himself on the grave-mound.  Everything\nwas quiet, only the moon appeared above the grave, and frequently\nan owl flew past and uttered her melancholy cry.  When the sun\nrose, the poor man betook himself in safety to his home, and in the\nsame manner the second night passed quietly by.  On the evening\nof the third day he felt a strange uneasiness, it seemed to him that\nsomething was about to happen.  When he went out he saw, by the\nchurchyard-wall, a man whom he had never seen before.  He\nwas no longer young, had scars on his face, and his eyes looked\nsharply and eagerly around.  He was entirely covered with an old\ncloak, and nothing was visible but his great riding-boots.  What\nare you looking for here, the peasant asked.  Are you not afraid\nof the lonely churchyard.\nI am looking for nothing, he answered, and I am afraid of\nnothing.  I am like the youngster who went forth to learn how to\nshudder, and had his labor for his pains, but got the king's\ndaughter to wife and great wealth with her, only I have remained\npoor.  I am nothing but a paid-off soldier, and I mean to pass\nthe night here, because I have no other shelter.  If you are without\nfear, said the peasant, stay with me, and help me to watch that\ngrave there.\nTo keep watch is a soldier's business, he replied, whatever we\nfall in with here, whether it be good or bad, we will share it\nbetween us.  The peasant agreed to this, and they seated themselves\non the grave together.\nAll was quiet until midnight, when suddenly a shrill whistling\nwas heard in the air, and the two watchers perceived the evil one\nstanding bodily before them.  Be off, you scoundrels, cried he to\nthem, the man who lies in that grave belongs to me.  I want to\ntake him, and if you don't go away I will wring your necks.  Sir\nwith the red feather, said the soldier, you are not my captain,\nI have no need to obey you, and I have not yet learned what fear\nis.  Go away, we shall stay sitting here.\nThe devil thought to himself, money is the best means with which\nto lay hold of these two vagabonds.  So he began to play a\nsofter tune, and asked quite kindly, if they would not accept\na bag of money, and go home with it.  That is worth listening\nto, answered the soldier, but one bag of gold won't serve us.  If\nyou will give as much as will go into one of my boots, we will quit\nthe field for you and go away.\nI have not so much as that about me, said the devil, but I will\nfetch it.  In the neighboring town lives a money-changer who is a\ngood friend of mine, and will readily advance it to me.  When the\ndevil had vanished the soldier took his left boot off, and said,\nwe will soon pull the charcoal-burner's nose for him, just give me\nyour knife, comrade.  He cut the sole off the boot, and put it\nin the high grass near the grave on the edge of a hole that was\nhalf over-grown.  That will do, said he.  Now the chimney-sweep\nmay come.\nThey both sat down and waited, and it was not long before the\ndevil returned with a small bag of gold in his hand.  Just pour\nit in, said the soldier, raising up the boot a little, but that\nwon't be enough.\nThe black one shook out all that was in the bag.  The gold fell\nthrough, and the boot remained empty.  Stupid devil, cried the\nsoldier, it won't do.  Didn't I say so at once.  Go back again, and\nbring more.  The devil shook his head, went, and in an hour's\ntime came with a much larger bag under his arm.  Now pour it in,\ncried the soldier, but I doubt the boot will be full.  The gold\nclinked as it fell, but the boot remained empty.  The devil looked\nin himself with his burning eyes, and convinced himself of the\ntruth.  You have shamefully big calves to your legs, cried he,\nand made a wry face.  Did you think, replied the soldier, that I had\na cloven foot like  you.  Since when have you been so stingy.  See\nthat you get more gold together, or our bargain will come to\nnothing.  The wicked one went off again.  This time he stayed\naway longer, and when at length he appeared he was panting under\nthe weight of a sack which lay on his shoulders.  He emptied it into\nthe boot, which was just as far from being filled as before.  He\nbecame furious, and was just going to tear the boot out of the\nsoldier's hands, but at that moment the first ray of the rising\nsun broke forth from the sky, and the evil spirit fled away with\nloud shrieks.  The poor soul was saved.\nThe peasant wished to divide the gold, but the soldier said,\ngive what falls to my lot to the poor, I will come with you to your\ncottage, and together we will live in rest and peace on what\nremains, as long as God is pleased to permit.\n", "The Boots of Buffalo-Leather": "A soldier who is afraid of nothing, troubles himself about\nnothing.  One of this kind had received his discharge, and\nas he had learnt no trade and could earn nothing, he traveled\nabout and begged alms of kind people.  He had an old rain-coat\non his back, and a pair of riding-boots of buffalo-leather which\nwere still left to him.  One day he was walking he knew not where,\nstraight out into the open country, and at length came to a forest.\nHe did not know where he was, but saw sitting on the trunk of a\ntree, which had been cut down, a man who was well dressed and\nwore a green shooting-coat.  The soldier shook hands with him, sat\ndown on the grass by his side, and stretched out his legs.  I see\nyou have good boots on, which are well blacked, said he to the\nhuntsman, but if you had to travel about as I have, they would\nnot last long.  Look at mine, they are of buffalo-leather, and\nhave been worn for a long time, but in them I can go through thick\nand thin.  After a while the soldier got up and said, I can stay\nno longer, hunger drives me onwards, but, brother brightboots,\nwhere does this road lead to.  I don't know that myself, answered\nthe huntsman, I have lost my way in the forest.  Then you are in the\nsame plight as I, said the soldier.  Birds of a feather flock\ntogether, let us remain together, and seek our way.  The huntsman\nsmiled a little, and they walked on further and further, until\nnight fell.  We do not get out of the forest, said the soldier,\nbut there in the distance I see a light shining.  There we might\nfind something to eat.  They found a stone house, knocked at the\ndoor, and an old woman opened it.  We are looking for quarters for\nthe night, said the soldier, and some lining for our stomachs, for\nmine is as empty as\nan old knapsack.  You cannot stay here, answered the old woman.\nThis is a robbers, house, and you would do wisely to get away\nbefore they come home, or you will be lost.  It won't be so bad\nas that, answered the soldier, I have not had a mouthful for two\ndays, and whether I am murdered here or die of hunger in the\nforest is all the same to me.  I shall come in.  The huntsman\nwould not follow, but the soldier drew him in with him by the\nsleeve.  Come, my dear brother, we shall not come to an end so\nquickly as that.  The old woman had pity on them and said, creep\nin here behind the stove, and if they leave anything, I will give\nit to you on the sly when they are asleep.  Scarcely were they in\nthe corner before twelve robbers came bursting in, seated themselves\nat the table which was already laid, and vehemently demanded some\nfood.  The old woman brought in some great dishes of roast meat,\nand the robbers enjoyed that thoroughly.  When the soldier smelled\nthe food, he said to the huntsman, I cannot hold out any\nlonger, I shall seat myself at the table, and eat with them.  You\nwill bring us to destruction, said the huntsman, and held him back\nby the arm.  But the soldier began to cough loudly.  When the\nrobbers heard that, they threw away their knives and forks, leapt\nup, and discovered the two who were behind the stove.  Aha,\ngentlemen, are you in the corner, cried they.  What are you doing\nhere.  Have you been sent as spies.  Wait a while, and you shall\nlearn how to\nfly on a dry bough.  But do be civil, said the soldier, I am\nhungry, give me something to eat, and then you can do what you\nlike with me.  The robbers were astonished, and the captain said,\nI see that you have no fear.  Well, you shall have some food,\nbut after that you must die.  We shall see, said the soldier, and\nseated himself at the table, and began to cut away valiantly at the\nroast meat.  Brother brightboots, come and eat, cried he to the\nhuntsman.  You must be as hungry as I am, and cannot have better\nroast meat at home, but the huntsman would not eat.  The robbers\nlooked at the soldier in astonishment, and said, the rascal uses\nno ceremony.  After a while he said, I have had enough food, now\nget me something good to drink.  The chief of the robbers was\nin the mood to humor him in this also, and called to the old\nwoman, bring a bottle out of the cellar, and mind it be of the\nbest.  The soldier drew the cork out with a loud noise, and then\nwent with the bottle to the huntsman and said, watch this, brother,\nand you shall see something that will surprise you.  I am now going\nto drink the health of the whole clan.  Then he brandished the\nbottle over the heads of the robbers, and cried, long life to\nyou all, but with your mouths open and your right hands lifted\nup, and then he drank a hearty draught.  Scarcely were the\nwords said than they all sat motionless as if made of stone,\nand their mouths were open and their right hands stretched up in\nthe air.  The huntsman said to the soldier, I see that you are\nacquainted with tricks of another kind, but now come and let us\ngo home.  Oho, my dear brother, but that would be marching\naway far too soon.  We have conquered the enemy, and must first\ntake the booty.  Those men there are sitting fast, and are opening\ntheir mouths with astonishment, but they will not be allowed to\nmove until I permit them.  Come, eat and drink.  The old woman\nhad to bring another bottle of the best wine, and the soldier would\nnot stir until he had eaten enough to last for three days.  At\nlast when day came, he said, now it is time to strike our tents,\nand in order that our march may be a short one, the old woman\nshall show us the nearest way to the town.\n\nWhen they had arrived there, he went to his old comrades, and\nsaid, out in the forest I have found a nest full of gallows,\nbirds, come with me and we will take it.  The soldier led them,\nand said to the huntsman, you must go back again with me to see\nhow they flutter when we seize them by the feet.  He placed\nthe men round about the robbers, and then he took the bottle,\ndrank a mouthful, brandished it above them, and cried, long life\nto you all.  Instantly they all regained the power of movement,\nbut were thrown down and bound hand and foot with cords.\nThen the soldier ordered them to be thrown into a cart as if\nthey had been so many sacks, and said, now drive them straight\nto prison.  The huntsman, however, took one of the men aside\nand gave him another commission as well.\n\nBrother brightboots, said the soldier, we have safely routed\nthe enemy and been well fed, now we will quietly walk behind\nthem as if we were stragglers.  When they approached the town,\nthe soldier saw a crowd of people pouring through the gate of\nthe town who were raising loud cries of joy, and waving green\nboughs in the air.  Then he saw that the entire body-guard was\ncoming up.  What can this mean, said he to the huntsman.\n\nDon't you know, he replied, that the king has for a long time\nbeen absent from his kingdom, and that today he is returning,\nand every one is going to meet him.  But where is the king,\nsaid the soldier.  I do not see him.  Here he is, answered\nthe huntsman, I am the king, and have announced my arrival.\n\nThen he opened his hunting-coat, and his royal garments were\nvisible.  The soldier was alarmed, and fell on his knees and\nbegged him to forgive him for having in his ignorance treated\nhim as an equal, and spoken to him by such a name.  But the\nking shook hands with him, and said, you are a brave soldier,\nand have saved my life.  You shall never again be in want,\nI will take care of you.  And if ever you would like to eat\na piece of roast meat, as good as that in the robber's house,\ncome to the royal kitchen.  But if you would drink a health,\nyou must first ask my permission.\n\n", "The Golden Key": "\nIn the winter time, when deep snow lay on the ground, a poor boy \nwas forced to go out on a sledge to fetch wood.  When he had \ngathered it together, and packed it, he wished, as he was so \nfrozen with cold, not to go home at once, but to light a fire and\nwarm himself a little.  So he scraped away the snow, and as he \nwas thus clearing the ground, he found a tiny golden key.  \nHereupon he thought that where the key was, the lock must be \nalso, and dug in the ground and found an iron chest.  \"If the\nkey does but fit it!\"  thought he; \"no doubt there are precious\nthings in that little box.\"  He searched, but no keyhole was\nthere.  At last he discovered one, but so small that it was\nhardly visible.  He tried it, and the key fitted it exactly.\nThen he turned it once round, and now we must wait until he has\nquite unlocked it and opened the lid, and then we shall learn\nwhat wonderful things were lying in that box.\n"}
