<br/>**Original text is in italics, followed by the translated version**

_"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven._<br/>But verily thy Lord is full of grace to mankind: Yet most of them are ungrateful.

_Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted._<br/>Yea, those who believe,- their faith is increased and they do rejoice.

_Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth._<br/>It is We Who will inherit the earth, and all beings thereon: to Us will they all be returned.

_Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled._<br/>That is best for those who seek the Countenance, of Allah, and it is they who will prosper.

_Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy._<br/>If only ye ask Allah for forgiveness, ye may hope to receive mercy.

_Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God._<br/>Him We chose and rendered pure in this world: And he will be in the Hereafter in the ranks of the Righteous.

_Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God._<br/>so order me that I may be grateful for Thy favours, which thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee: And admit me, by Thy Grace, to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants.''

_Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven._<br/>Yea, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: so that He rewards those who do evil, according to their deeds, and He rewards those who do good, with what is best.

_"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me._<br/>If ye (but) eschew the most heinous of the things which ye are forbidden to do, We shall expel out of you all the evil in you, and admit you to a gate of great honour.

_Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you._<br/>Those are the ones who will be rewarded with the highest place in heaven, because of their patient constancy: therein shall they be met with salutations and peace, Dwelling therein;- how beautiful an abode and place of rest!

_"You are the salt of the earth._<br/>If it be ye can pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, pass ye!

_But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?_<br/>Were it Our Will, We could make it salt (and unpalatable): then why do ye not give thanks?

_It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot._<br/>this is no more than Thy trial: by it Thou causest whom Thou wilt to stray, and Thou leadest whom Thou wilt into the right path.

_"You are the light of the world._<br/>Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.

_A town built on a hill can not be hidden._<br/>Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse, And the mountains as pegs?

_Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl._<br/>Neither can a people anticipate its term, nor delay it.

_Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house._<br/>In the end will they return to their Lord, and We shall then tell them the truth of all that they did.

_In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven._<br/>Then, as to those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them to His Mercy that will be the achievement for all to see.

_"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them._<br/>If it had been Allah's plan, they would not have taken false gods: but We made thee not one to watch over their doings, nor art thou set over them to dispose of their affairs.

_For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished._<br/>but most surely, by my Lord, it will come upon you;- by Him Who knows the unseen,- from Whom is not hidden the least little atom in the heavens or on earth: Nor is there anything less than that, or greater, but is in the Record Perspicuous: That He may reward those who believe and work deeds of righteousness: for such is Forgiveness and a Sustenance Most Generous.''

_Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven._<br/>"But if they strive to make thee join in worship with Me things of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not; yet bear them company in this life with justice (and consideration), and follow the way of those who turn to me (in love): in the end the return of you all is to Me, and I will tell you the truth (and meaning) of all that ye did.''

_For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven._<br/>It is not (possible) that a man, to whom is given the Book, and Wisdom, and the prophetic office, should say to people:"Be ye my worshippers rather than Allah's'': on the contrary (He would say)"Be ye worshippers of Him Who is truly the Cherisher of all: For ye have taught the Book and ye have studied it earnestly.''

_"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago,` You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.'_<br/>Then sent We our messengers in succession: every time there came to a people their messenger, they accused him of falsehood: so We made them follow each other (in punishment): We made them as a tale (that is told): So away with a people that will not believe!

_But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment._<br/>When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said:"Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord?''

_Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister,` Raca,' is answerable to the court._<br/>But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand, and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a Mercy from your Lord.

_And anyone who says,` You fool!'_<br/>But if ye deny Him, lo!

_will be in danger of the fire of hell._<br/>for it would be the Fire of Hell!

_"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar._<br/>But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand, and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a Mercy from your Lord.

_First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift._<br/>They ask: When will this promise be (fulfilled)?

_"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court._<br/>if ye prayed for victory and judgment, now hath the judgment come to you: if ye desist (from wrong), it will be best for you: if ye return (to the attack), so shall We.

_Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison._<br/>And if any do evil, their faces will be thrown headlong into the Fire:"Do ye receive a reward other than that which ye have earned by your deeds?''

_Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny._<br/>-"Did We not give you long enough life so that he that would should receive admonition?

_"You have heard that it was said,` You shall not commit adultery.'_<br/>Say:"Ye shall not be questioned as to our sins, nor shall we be questioned as to what ye do.''

_But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart._<br/>If any of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess: And Allah hath full knowledge about your faith.

_If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away._<br/>whether wilt thou that thou throw (first) or that we be the first to throw?''

_It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell._<br/>And if any do evil, their faces will be thrown headlong into the Fire:"Do ye receive a reward other than that which ye have earned by your deeds?''

_And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away._<br/>Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will cause you all to die on the cross!''

_It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell._<br/>But he that will give more, of his own free will,- it is better for him.

_"It has been said,` Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'_<br/>But those who divorce their wives by Zihar, then wish to go back on the words they uttered,- (It is ordained that such a one) should free a slave before they touch each other: Thus are ye admonished to perform: and Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.

_But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery._<br/>Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry and but a woman similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an Unbeliever marry such a woman: to the Believers such a thing is forbidden.

_"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago,` Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.'_<br/>I am to you a Warner, clear and open:"That ye should worship Allah, fear Him and obey me:"So He may forgive you your sins and give you respite for a stated Term: for when the Term given by Allah is accomplished, it can not be put forward: if ye only knew.''

_But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King._<br/>It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards east or West; but it is righteousness- to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic.

_And do not swear by your head, for you can not make even one hair white or black._<br/>As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe.

_All you need to say is simply` Yes' or` No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one._<br/>But if ye are constant and do right, not the least harm will their cunning do to you; for Allah Compasseth round about all that they do.

_"You have heard that it was said,` Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'_<br/>We ordained therein for them:"Life for life, eye for eye, nose or nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal for equal.''

_But I tell you, do not resist an evil person._<br/>I wish not, in opposition to you, to do that which I forbid you to do.

_If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also._<br/>If then any one transgresses the prohibition against you, Transgress ye likewise against him.

_And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well._<br/>But if any turn away and reject Allah,- Allah will punish him with a mighty Punishment, For to Us will be their return; Then it will be for Us to call them to account.

_If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles._<br/>If any of them follow thee,- Hell will I fill with you all.

_Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you._<br/>As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe.

_"You have heard that it was said,` Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'_<br/>And their Lord called unto them:"Did I not forbid you that tree, and tell you that Satan was an avowed enemy unto you?''

_But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven._<br/>"Do ye wonder that there hath come to you a message from your Lord, through a man of your own people, to warn you,- so that ye may fear Allah and haply receive His Mercy?''

_He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous._<br/>And among His Signs, He shows you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope, and He sends down rain from the sky and with it gives life to the earth after it is dead: verily in that are Signs for those who are wise.

_If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?_<br/>Thus indeed do we reward those who do right.

_Are not even the tax collectors doing that?_<br/>Do they not think that they will be called to account?

_And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others?_<br/>And those who followed would say:"If only We had one more chance, We would clear ourselves of them, as they have cleared themselves of us.''

_Do not even pagans do that?_<br/>Did ye not, then, understand?

_Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect._<br/>But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of Allah: that is the supreme felicity.

_"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them._<br/>If they bring such witnesses, be not thou amongst them: Nor follow thou the vain desires of such as treat our signs as falsehoods, and such as believe not in the Hereafter: for they hold others as equal with their Guardian-Lord.

_If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven._<br/>If anyone invokes, besides Allah, Any other god, he has no authority therefor; and his reckoning will be only with his Lord!

_"So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others._<br/>Truly, if the Hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who stir up sedition in the City, desist not, We shall certainly stir thee up against them: Then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbours for any length of time: They shall have a curse on them: whenever they are found, they shall be seized and slain (without mercy).

_Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full._<br/>Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.

_But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret._<br/>If ye call them to guidance, they will not obey: For you it is the same whether ye call them or ye hold your peace!

_Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you._<br/>Then, as to those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them to His Mercy that will be the achievement for all to see.

_"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others._<br/>Truly, if the Hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who stir up sedition in the City, desist not, We shall certainly stir thee up against them: Then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbours for any length of time: They shall have a curse on them: whenever they are found, they shall be seized and slain (without mercy).

_Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full._<br/>Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.

_But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen._<br/>And when it is said to them,"Come, the Messenger of Allah will pray for your forgiveness'', they turn aside their heads, and thou wouldst see them turning away their faces in arrogance.

_Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you._<br/>Then, as to those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them to His Mercy that will be the achievement for all to see.

_And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words._<br/>And when they hear vain talk, they turn away therefrom and say:"To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ignorant.''

_Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him._<br/>But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing?

_"This, then, is how you should pray: ''` Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven._<br/>Be ye foremost (in seeking) Forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden (of Bliss), the width whereof is as the width of heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers: that is the Grace of Allah, which He bestows on whom he pleases: and Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding.

_Give us today our daily bread._<br/>They had both to eat their (daily) food.

_And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors._<br/>"Only, our desire is that our Lord will forgive us our faults, that we may become foremost among the believers!''

_And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'_<br/>"Therefore let not such as believe not therein but follow their own lusts, divert thee therefrom, lest thou perish!''..

_For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you._<br/>if ye fear Allah, He will grant you a criterion (to judge between right and wrong), remove from you (all) evil (that may afflict) you, and forgive you: for Allah is the Lord of grace unbounded.

_But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins._<br/>And be ye not like those who forgot Allah; and He made them forget their own souls!

_"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting._<br/>Whatever ye are given (here) is (but) a convenience of this life: but that which is with Allah is better and more lasting: (it is) for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord: Those who avoid the greater crimes and shameful deeds, and, when they are angry even then forgive; Those who hearken to their Lord, and establish regular Prayer; who (conduct) their affairs by mutual Consultation; who spend out of what We bestow on them for Sustenance; And those who, when an oppressive wrong is inflicted on them, (are not cowed but) help and defend themselves.

_Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full._<br/>Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.

_But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you._<br/>but most surely, by my Lord, it will come upon you;- by Him Who knows the unseen,- from Whom is not hidden the least little atom in the heavens or on earth: Nor is there anything less than that, or greater, but is in the Record Perspicuous: That He may reward those who believe and work deeds of righteousness: for such is Forgiveness and a Sustenance Most Generous.''

_"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal._<br/>Do ye then feel secure that He will not cause you to be swallowed up beneath the earth when ye are on land, or that He will not send against you a violent tornado (with showers of stones) so that ye shall find no one to carry out your affairs for you?

_But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal._<br/>After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banish a party of you from their homes; assist (Their enemies) against them, in guilt and rancour; and if they come to you as captives, ye ransom them, though it was not lawful for you to banish them.

_For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also._<br/>There will be for them therein all that they wish,- and more besides in Our Presence.

_"The eye is the lamp of the body._<br/>Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.

_If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light._<br/>To Him will be your return- of all of you.

_But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness._<br/>Of those who reject faith the patrons are the evil ones: from light they will lead them forth into the depths of darkness.

_If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!_<br/>Or the depths of darkness equal with light?''

_"No one can serve two masters._<br/>No aid can they give them, nor can they aid themselves!

_Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other._<br/>But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you.

_You can not serve both God and money._<br/>No aid can they give them, nor can they aid themselves!

_"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear._<br/>wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of prayer: eat and drink: But waste not by excess, for Allah loveth not the wasters.

_Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?_<br/>Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those before them?

_Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them._<br/>bestow wisdom on me, and join me with the righteous;"Grant me honourable mention on the tongue of truth among the latest (generations);"Make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss;"Forgive my father, for that he is among those astray;"And let me not be in disgrace on the Day when (men) will be raised up;-"The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail,"But only he (will prosper) that brings to Allah a sound heart;"To the righteous, the Garden will be brought near,"And to those straying in Evil, the Fire will be placed in full view;"And it shall be said to them:` Where are the (gods) ye worshipped-''` Besides Allah?

_Are you not much more valuable than they?_<br/>Will they not then be grateful?

_Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?_<br/>Do they then only wait for the Hour,- that it should come on them of a sudden?

_"And why do you worry about clothes?_<br/>Why do ye clothe Truth with falsehood, and conceal the Truth, while ye have knowledge?

_See how the flowers of the field grow._<br/>the garden before you!

_They do not labor or spin._<br/>they do not so.

_Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these._<br/>Be not then in doubt thereon: for it is the truth from thy Lord: yet many among men do not believe!

_If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you-- you of little faith?_<br/>Does any of you wish that he should have a garden with date-palms and vines and streams flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruit, while he is stricken with old age, and his children are not strong (enough to look after themselves)- that it should be caught in a whirlwind, with fire therein, and be burnt up?

_So do not worry, saying,` What shall we eat?'_<br/>he said,"Will ye not eat?''

_or` What shall we drink?'_<br/>Do ye then see?

_or` What shall we wear?'_<br/>Do ye then see?

_For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them._<br/>Say:"The best thing to do is what is for their good; if ye mix their affairs with yours, they are your brethren; but Allah knows the man who means mischief from the man who means good.

_But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well._<br/>Then, as to those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them to His Mercy that will be the achievement for all to see.

_Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself._<br/>Nor say of anything,"I shall be sure to do so and so tomorrow''- Without adding,"So please Allah!''

_Each day has enough trouble of its own._<br/>It gets every good that it earns, and it suffers every ill that it earns.

_"Do not judge, or you too will be judged._<br/>Do they not think that they will be called to account?

_For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you._<br/>In the end will they return to their Lord, and We shall then tell them the truth of all that they did.

_"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?_<br/>It is no fault in the blind nor in one born lame, nor in one afflicted with illness, nor in yourselves, that ye should eat in your own houses, or those of your fathers, or your mothers, or your brothers, or your sisters, or your father's brothers or your father's sisters, or your mother's brothers, or your mother's sisters, or in houses of which the keys are in your possession, or in the house of a sincere friend of yours: there is no blame on you, whether ye eat in company or separately.

_How can you say to your brother,` Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?_<br/>No more measure of grain shall we get (unless we take our brother): So send our brother with us, that we may get our measure; and we will indeed take every care of him.''

_You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye._<br/>Then Allah sent a raven, who scratched the ground, to show him how to hide the shame of his brother.

_"Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs._<br/>Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred month, nor of the animals brought for sacrifice, nor the garlands that mark out such animals, nor the people resorting to the sacred house, seeking of the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord.

_If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces._<br/>If they do come to thee, either judge between them, or decline to interfere.

_"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you._<br/>And those who feared their Lord will be led to the Garden in crowds: until behold, they arrive there; its gates will be opened; and its keepers will say:"Peace be upon you!

_For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened._<br/>If Allah so willed, He could make you all one people: But He leaves straying whom He pleases, and He guides whom He pleases: but ye shall certainly be called to account for all your actions.

_"Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?_<br/>As to one of you, he will pour out the wine for his lord to drink: as for the other, he will hang from the cross, and the birds will eat from off his head.

_Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?_<br/>- Or that he might receive admonition, and the teaching might profit him?

_If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!_<br/>If only they had said:"What hear and we obey''; and"Do hear''; and"Do look at us''; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allah hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe.

_So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets._<br/>Then, as to those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them to His Mercy that will be the achievement for all to see.

_"Enter through the narrow gate._<br/>enter not all by one gate: enter ye by different gates.

_For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it._<br/>Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land.

_But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it._<br/>But never will they fail to receive justice in the least little thing.

_"Watch out for false prophets._<br/> (Further, We sent a long line of prophets for your instruction).

_They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves._<br/>If they were to get the better of you, they would behave to you as enemies, and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you for evil: and they desire that ye should reject the Truth.

_By their fruit you will recognize them._<br/>And (they shall have) fruits,- all they desire.

_Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?_<br/>With it He produces for you corn, olives, date-palms, grapes and every kind of fruit: verily in this is a sign for those who give thought.

_Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit._<br/>And We shall bestow on them, of fruit and meat, anything they shall desire.

_A good tree can not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree can not bear good fruit._<br/>They are those whose works will bear no fruit in this world and in the Hereafter nor will they have anyone to help.

_Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire._<br/>And if any of you Turn back from their faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter; they will be companions of the Fire and will abide therein.

_Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them._<br/>And (they shall have) fruits,- all they desire.

_"Not everyone who says to me,` Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven._<br/> (The angels say:)"We descend not but by command of thy Lord: to Him belongeth what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between: and thy Lord never doth forget,-"Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and of all that is between them; so worship Him, and be constant and patient in His worship: knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He?''

_Many will say to me on that day,` Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?'_<br/>And its keepers will say,"Did not messengers come to you from among yourselves, rehearsing to you the Signs of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of This Day of yours?''

_Then I will tell them plainly,' I never knew you._<br/>never could I say what I had no right (to say).

_Away from me, you evildoers!'_<br/>But turn away from them, and say"Peace!''

_"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock._<br/>And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in (men's) habitations; Then to eat of all the produce (of the earth), and find with skill the spacious paths of its Lord: there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colours, wherein is healing for men: verily in this is a Sign for those who give thought.

_The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock._<br/>- generations We had established on the earth, in strength such as We have not given to you- for whom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance, and gave (fertile) streams flowing beneath their (feet): yet for their sins We destroyed them, and raised in their wake fresh generations (to succeed them).

_But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand._<br/>But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands, Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete his favour to you, that ye may be grateful.

_The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.''_<br/>And among His Signs, He shows you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope, and He sends down rain from the sky and with it gives life to the earth after it is dead: verily in that are Signs for those who are wise.

_When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law._<br/>For, Believers are those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a tremor in their hearts, and when they hear His signs rehearsed, find their faith strengthened, and put (all) their trust in their Lord; Who establish regular prayers and spend (freely) out of the gifts We have given them for sustenance: Such in truth are the believers: they have grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness, and generous sustenance: Just as thy Lord ordered thee out of thy house in truth, even though a party among the Believers disliked it, Disputing with thee concerning the truth after it was made manifest, as if they were being driven to death and they (actually) saw it.
