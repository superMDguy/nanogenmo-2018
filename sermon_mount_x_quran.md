<br/>**Original text is in italics, followed by the translated version**

_"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven._<br/>It is you who are the poor, in need of God; while God is the Rich, the Praiseworthy.

_Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted._<br/>Some will be miserable, and some will be happy.

_Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth._<br/>It is We who will inherit the earth and everyone on it, and to Us they will be returned.

_Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled._<br/>God has promised those who believe and work righteousness: they will have forgiveness and a great reward.

_Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy._<br/>These -- God will have mercy on them.

_Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God._<br/>Once they have become pure, approach them in the way God has directed you. ''

_Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God._<br/>The Jews and the Christians say, "We are the children of God, and His beloved. ''

_Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven._<br/>But then your Lord -- for those who emigrated after being persecuted, then struggled and persevered -- your Lord thereafter is Forgiving and Merciful.

_"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me._<br/>Then, when they neglected what they were reminded of, We saved those who prohibited evil, and We seized those who did wrong with a terrible punishment, because of their sinfulness.

_Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you._<br/>And as for those who are happy, they will be in Paradise, remaining therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills -- a reward without end.

_"You are the salt of the earth._<br/>Say, "Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? ''

_But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?_<br/>If We will, We can make it salty.

_It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot._<br/>There is no blame on the blind, nor any blame on the lame, nor any blame on the sick.

_"You are the light of the world._<br/>God is the Light of the heavens and the earth.

_A town built on a hill can not be hidden._<br/>There is a ban on the town that We had destroyed -- that they will not return.

_Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl._<br/>We will produce for you magic like it; so make an appointment between us and you, which we will not miss -- neither us, nor you -- in a central place. ''

_Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house._<br/>Whenever it illuminates for them, they walk in it; but when it grows dark over them, they stand still.

_In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven._<br/>As for those who believe and do good deeds, and humble themselves before their Lord -- these are the inhabitants of Paradise, where they will abide forever.

_"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them._<br/>Those who disbelieve, and hinder from the path of God, and oppose the Messenger after guidance has become clear to them -- they will not hurt God in the least, but He will nullify their deeds.

_For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished._<br/>Not even the weight of an atom, on earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor is there anything smaller or larger, but is in a clear record.

_Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven._<br/>And as for those who are happy, they will be in Paradise, remaining therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills -- a reward without end.

_For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven._<br/>Say, "Come, let me tell you what your Lord has forbidden you: that you associate nothing with Him; that you honor your parents; that you do not kill your children because of poverty -- We provide for you and for them; that you do not come near indecencies, whether outward or inward; and that you do not kill the soul which God has sanctified -- except in the course of justice.

_"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ` You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment. '_<br/>If you have doubts, let them swear by God: "We will not sell our testimony for any price, even if he was a near relative, and we will not conceal God 's testimony, for then we would be sinners. ''

_But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment._<br/>And my brother Aaron, he is more eloquent than me, so send him with me, to help me, and to confirm my words, for I fear they will reject me. ''

_Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ` Raca, ' is answerable to the court._<br/>And if anyone disputes with you about him, after the knowledge that has come to you, say, "Come, let us call our children and your children, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, and let us invoke God 's curse on the liars. ''

_And anyone who says, ` You fool! '_<br/>Is there anyone who would understand?

_will be in danger of the fire of hell._<br/>While the wicked will be in Hell.

_"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar._<br/>Say, "If your parents, and your children, and your siblings, and your spouses, and your relatives, and the wealth you have acquired, and a business you worry about, and homes you love, are more dear to you than God, and His Messenger, and the struggle in His cause, then wait until God executes His judgment. ''

_First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift._<br/>Then to Us is your return, and We will inform you of what you used to do.

_"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court._<br/>Then to your Lord is your return, then He will inform you regarding your disputes.

_Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison._<br/>Do not set up with God another god, or else you will be thrown in Hell, rebuked and banished.

_Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny._<br/>Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.

_"You have heard that it was said, ` You shall not commit adultery. '_<br/>And do not coerce them in order to take away some of what you had given them, unless they commit a proven adultery.

_But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart._<br/>And if anyone disputes with you about him, after the knowledge that has come to you, say, "Come, let us call our children and your children, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, and let us invoke God 's curse on the liars. ''

_If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away._<br/>If they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them.

_It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell._<br/>It is that thought of yours about your Lord that led you to ruin -- so you became of the losers.

_And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away._<br/>If they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them.

_It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell._<br/>But if you keep it secret, and give it to the needy in private, that is better for you.

_"It has been said, ` Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce. '_<br/>We have permitted to you your wives to whom you have given their dowries, and those you already have, as granted to you by God, and the daughters of your paternal uncle, and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncle, and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you, and a believing woman who has offered herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet desires to marry her, exclusively for you, and not for the believers.

_But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery._<br/>When they are married, if they commit adultery, their punishment shall be half that of free women.

_"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ` Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made. '_<br/>Until, when they have reached it, and its gates are opened, its keepers will say to them, "Did not messengers from among you come to you, reciting to you the revelations of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours? ''

_But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God 's throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King._<br/>Surely, those who say: "Our Lord is God, '' and then go straight, the angels will descend upon them: "Do not fear, and do not grieve, but rejoice in the news of the Garden which you were promised.

_And do not swear by your head, for you can not make even one hair white or black._<br/>And do not keep your hand tied to your neck, nor spread it out fully, lest you end up liable and regretful.

_All you need to say is simply ` Yes ' or ` No '; anything beyond this comes from the evil one._<br/>"It is only proper that I should not say about God anything other than the truth.

_"You have heard that it was said, ` Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth. '_<br/>And We wrote for them in it: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal wound for a wound; but whoever forgoes it in charity, it will serve as atonement for him.

_But I tell you, do not resist an evil person._<br/>But even if you accept them, God does not accept the wicked people.

_If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also._<br/>If any of your servants wish to be freed, grant them their wish, if you recognize some good in them.

_And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well._<br/>If any of your servants wish to be freed, grant them their wish, if you recognize some good in them.

_If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles._<br/>If they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them.

_Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you._<br/>And do not let him who denies it and follows his desire turn you away from it, lest you fall.

_"You have heard that it was said, ` Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. '_<br/>And their Lord called out to them, "Did I not forbid you from this tree, and say to you that Satan is a sworn enemy to you? ''

_But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven._<br/>And remember God 's blessings upon you; how you were enemies, and He reconciled your hearts, and by His grace you became brethren.

_He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous._<br/>It is He who brings down the rain after they have despaired, and unfolds His mercy.

_If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?_<br/>If you obey, God will give you a fine reward.

_Are not even the tax collectors doing that?_<br/>Do not ever think that God is unaware of what the wrongdoers do.

_And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others?_<br/>He said, "Do You see this one whom You have honored more than me?

_Do not even pagans do that?_<br/>Do they not think?

_Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect._<br/>Whatever good you do, God is aware of it.

_"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them._<br/>And do not allow your oaths in God 's name to hinder you from virtue, and righteousness, and making peace between people.

_If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven._<br/>"But if you do not bring him to me, you will have no measure from me, and you will not come near me. ''

_"So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others._<br/>If the hypocrites, and those with sickness in their hearts, and the rumormongers in the City, do not desist, We will incite you against them; then they will not be your neighbors there except for a short while.

_Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full._<br/>And as for those who believe and do good works, He will give them their rewards in full.

_But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret._<br/>But if you keep it secret, and give it to the needy in private, that is better for you.

_Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you._<br/>As for those who fear their Lord in secret -- for them is forgiveness and a great reward.

_"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others._<br/>If the hypocrites, and those with sickness in their hearts, and the rumormongers in the City, do not desist, We will incite you against them; then they will not be your neighbors there except for a short while.

_Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full._<br/>And as for those who believe and do good works, He will give them their rewards in full.

_But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen._<br/>But if you turn away from them, seeking mercy from your Lord which you hope for, then say to them words of comfort.

_Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you._<br/>As for those who fear their Lord in secret -- for them is forgiveness and a great reward.

_And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words._<br/>And when they hear vain talk, they avoid it, and say, "We have our deeds, and you have your deeds; peace be upon you; we do not desire the ignorant. ''

_Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him._<br/>Do not covet what God has given to some of you in preference to others.

_"This, then, is how you should pray:  '' ` Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven._<br/>Surely, those who say: "Our Lord is God, '' and then go straight, the angels will descend upon them: "Do not fear, and do not grieve, but rejoice in the news of the Garden which you were promised.

_Give us today our daily bread._<br/>"Eat of your Lord 's provision, and give thanks to Him. ''

_And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors._<br/>You are our Protector, so forgive us, and have mercy on us.

_And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. '_<br/>But even if you accept them, God does not accept the wicked people.

_For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you._<br/>Say, "If you love God, then follow me, and God will love you, and will forgive you your sins. ''

_But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins._<br/>It is the same for them, whether you ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them; God will not forgive them.

_"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting._<br/>That is because they never suffer any thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger in the cause of God, nor do they take one step that enrages the disbelievers, nor do they gain anything from an enemy, but it is recorded to their credit as a righteous deed.

_Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full._<br/>And as for those who believe and do good works, He will give them their rewards in full.

_But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you._<br/>Say, "Come, let me tell you what your Lord has forbidden you: that you associate nothing with Him; that you honor your parents; that you do not kill your children because of poverty -- We provide for you and for them; that you do not come near indecencies, whether outward or inward; and that you do not kill the soul which God has sanctified -- except in the course of justice.

_"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal._<br/>As for those who disbelieve, even if they owned everything on earth, and the like of it with it, and they offered it to ransom themselves from the torment of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them.

_But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal._<br/>As for those who disbelieve, even if they owned everything on earth, and the like of it with it, and they offered it to ransom themselves from the torment of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them.

_For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also._<br/>For your Lord will have inspired it.

_"The eye is the lamp of the body._<br/>The lamp is within a glass.

_If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light._<br/>If you find them to be mature enough, hand over their properties to them.

_But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness._<br/>If only the wrongdoers would realize, when they see the torment; that all power is God 's, and that God is severe in punishment.

_If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!_<br/>Or are darkness and light equal?

_"No one can serve two masters._<br/>No fatigue will ever touch them therein, nor will they be asked to leave it.

_Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other._<br/>But it may be that you dislike something while it is good for you, and it may be that you like something while it is bad for you.

_You can not serve both God and money._<br/>My money can not avail me.

_"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear._<br/>Dress properly at every place of worship, and eat and drink, but do not be excessive.

_Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?_<br/>Have they not considered that God, who created them, is more powerful than they?

_Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them._<br/>And recall when you said, "O Moses, we can not endure one kind of food, so call to your Lord to produce for us of what the earth grows: of its herbs, and its cucumbers, and its garlic, and its lentils, and its onions. ''

_Are you not much more valuable than they?_<br/>Have they not considered that God, who created them, is more powerful than they?

_Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?_<br/>Can you feel a single one of them, or hear from them the slightest whisper?

_"And why do you worry about clothes?_<br/>Here you are -- you argue about things you know, but why do you argue about things you do not know?

_See how the flowers of the field grow._<br/>Then happiness, and flowers, and Garden of Delights.

_They do not labor or spin._<br/>So do not let them dispute with you in this matter.

_Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these._<br/>So do not acclaim your own virtue; He is fully aware of the righteous.

_If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you -- you of little faith?_<br/>Have you not considered how God sends down water from the sky, then He makes it flow into underground wells, then He produces with it plants of various colors, then they wither and you see them yellowing, then He turns them into debris?

_So do not worry, saying, ` What shall we eat? '_<br/>He said, "Will you not eat? ''

_or ` What shall we drink? '_<br/>And that you shall serve Me?

_or ` What shall we wear? '_<br/>Will they, then, believe?

_For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them._<br/>Say, "Are you going to teach God about your religion, when God knows everything in the heavens and the earth, and God is aware of all things? ''

_But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well._<br/>To Him belongs the Kingdom, and to Him all praise is due, and He is Able to do all things.

_Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself._<br/>And never say about anything, "I will do that tomorrow. ''

_Each day has enough trouble of its own._<br/>Whoever is given wisdom has been given much good.

_"Do not judge, or you too will be judged._<br/>But if you fear you will not be fair, then one, or what you already have.

_For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you._<br/>Then to Us is your return, and We will inform you of what you used to do.

_"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother 's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?_<br/>There is no blame on the blind, nor any blame on the lame, nor any blame on the sick, nor on yourselves for eating at your homes, or your fathers ' homes, or your mothers ' homes, or your brothers ' homes, or your sisters ' homes, or the homes of your paternal uncles, or the homes of your paternal aunts, or the homes of your maternal uncles, or the homes of your maternal aunts, or those whose keys you own, or the homes of your friends.

_How can you say to your brother, ` Let me take the speck out of your eye, ' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?_<br/>Say, "Come, let me tell you what your Lord has forbidden you: that you associate nothing with Him; that you honor your parents; that you do not kill your children because of poverty -- We provide for you and for them; that you do not come near indecencies, whether outward or inward; and that you do not kill the soul which God has sanctified -- except in the course of justice.

_You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother 's eye._<br/>They will say, "Yes, but you cheated your souls, and waited, and doubted, and became deluded by wishful thinking, until the command of God arrived; and arrogance deceived you regarding God. ''

_"Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs._<br/>Do not violate God 's sacraments, nor the Sacred Month, nor the offerings, nor the garlanded, nor those heading for the Sacred House seeking blessings from their Lord and approval.

_If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces._<br/>If they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them.

_"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you._<br/>Say, "The death from which you flee will catch up with you; then you will be returned to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He will inform you of what you used to do. ''

_For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened._<br/>But whoever desires the Hereafter, and pursues it as it should be pursued, while he is a believer; these -- their effort will be appreciated.

_"Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?_<br/>""And when the disciples said, ' O Jesus son of Mary, is your Lord able to bring down for us a feast from heaven? '

_Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?_<br/>Then the fish swallowed him, and he was to blame.

_If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!_<br/>Say, "Come, let me tell you what your Lord has forbidden you: that you associate nothing with Him; that you honor your parents; that you do not kill your children because of poverty -- We provide for you and for them; that you do not come near indecencies, whether outward or inward; and that you do not kill the soul which God has sanctified -- except in the course of justice.

_So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets._<br/>But why do they come to you for judgment, when they have the Torah, in which is God 's Law?

_"Enter through the narrow gate._<br/>On a straight path.

_For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it._<br/>If you find their rejection hard to bear, then if you can, seek a tunnel into the earth, or a stairway into the heaven, and bring them a sign.

_But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it._<br/>And do not think it too trivial to write down, whether small or large, including the time of repayment.

_"Watch out for false prophets._<br/>Say, "Why did you kill God 's prophets before, if you were believers? ''

_They come to you in sheep 's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves._<br/>As of cattle and sheep: We forbade them their fat, except what adheres to their backs, or the entrails, or what is mixed with bone.

_By their fruit you will recognize them._<br/>And fruits as they desire.

_Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?_<br/>In them are fruits, and date-palms, and pomegranates.

_Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit._<br/>A good word is like a good tree -- its root is firm, and its branches are in the sky.

_A good tree can not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree can not bear good fruit._<br/>Eat of its fruit when it yields, and give its due on the day of its harvest, and do not waste.

_Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire._<br/>Not a leaf falls but He knows it; and there is not a single grain in the darkness of earth, nor is there anything wet or dry, but is in a clear record.

_Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them._<br/>And We will supply them with fruit, and meat; such as they desire.

_"Not everyone who says to me, ` Lord, Lord, ' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven._<br/>Surely, those who say: "Our Lord is God, '' and then go straight, the angels will descend upon them: "Do not fear, and do not grieve, but rejoice in the news of the Garden which you were promised.

_Many will say to me on that day, ` Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles? '_<br/>Those who recite the Book of God, and perform the prayer, and spend of what We have provided for them, secretly and publicly, expect a trade that will not fail.

_Then I will tell them plainly, ' I never knew you._<br/>We will never believe in you. ''

_Away from me, you evildoers! '_<br/>So consider the end of the evildoers.

_"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock._<br/>Say, "If your parents, and your children, and your siblings, and your spouses, and your relatives, and the wealth you have acquired, and a business you worry about, and homes you love, are more dear to you than God, and His Messenger, and the struggle in His cause, then wait until God executes His judgment. ''

_The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock._<br/>Have you not seen how God propels the clouds, then brings them together, then piles them into a heap, and you see rain drops emerging from its midst?

_But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand._<br/>If you are sick, or traveling, or one of you comes from the toilet, or you have had intercourse with women, and can not find water, find clean sand and wipe your faces and your hands with it.

_The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash. ''_<br/>In the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of night and day; in the ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of mankind; in the water that God sends down from the sky, and revives the earth with it after it had died, and scatters in it all kinds of creatures; in the changing of the winds, and the clouds disposed between the sky and the earth; are signs for people who understand.

_When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law._<br/>Until, when they have reached it, and its gates are opened, its keepers will say to them, "Did not messengers from among you come to you, reciting to you the revelations of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours? ''
