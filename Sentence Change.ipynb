This I concealed where no one has ever discovered it; but my fears would not allow me to go back for the other, as I might perhaps have done, had I foreseen how terribly its presence might tell against my master. Still, I could not see what harm could come to me by complying with his request, and certainly I could not have devised any arrangement which would give me such an opportunity of satisfying my curiosity. It was indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not any lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to lay very few of my records before the public. These treats were, however, rare events, and made such a mark upon my mind, that when I was sixteen years of age I could have checked off upon my fingers all that I had ever seen. \n",

      " Everything which the girl said seemed to be meant as an insult to me, and yet I could not imagine how I had ever offended her. Her whole life was a round of devotion and of love, which was divided between her husband and her only son, Harold. \"You must know, Sir Charles, that though my son knew nothing of his parents, we were both alive, and had never lost sight of him. Now that they had not only ceased to protect him, but had themselves become a source of trouble to him, he began to understand how great the blessing was which he had enjoyed, and to sigh for the happy days before his girls had come under the influence of his neighbor. In her pure and earnest mind her mother's memory was enshrined as that of a saint, and the thought that any one should take her place seemed a terrible desecration. He was married to the second daughter of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir Lothian's descendants have their eye upon the property, they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was before them. \n",

There was no sound in the woods -- not a leaf moved upon the trees, and all was peace around us -- but we should have been warned by our first experience how cunningly and how patiently these creatures can watch and wait until their chance comes. Now her spirit seemed very near him, and his own was tempered by its presence. I never said anything, and I tried not to make myself ridiculous. My mother lived for five years after my father's disappearance, although at the time all the doctors said that she could not survive long. \"If it were not for our great ancestors and for our beloved country, the Queen of the Waters,\" said he, \"I could find it in my heart to be glad at this destruction which has come upon this vain and feeble generation. How spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by Miss Julia Ames, who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication, but admitted, after fifteen years, that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over. Her mother, despairing of preserving her sight, and being not of ability to send her to London to be touched by the king, being miserably poor, having many poor children, and this girl not being able to work, her mother, desirous to have her daughter cured, sent to the chirurgeons for help, who tampered with it for some time, but could do no good. You'll understand that I really do love you when I tell you that, if it were not that I knew you were frightened and unhappy, these last two days in which we have been always together would have been infinitely the happiest of my life.\" In the presence of an agonized world, hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth, seeing around one the wives and m\n"
